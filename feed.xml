&lt;p&gt;The DHI Hartlib project is a digital initiative that preserves and promotes the work of Samuel Hartlib, a 17th-century intellectual and promoter of knowledge sharing. It focuses on Hartlib's extensive correspondence and writings related to education, science, and experimental philosophy, facilitating access to historical texts for research and educational purposes. The website serves as a repository, offering resources such as digitized documents, analytical essays, and tools for understanding the context and influence of Hartlib's ideas in the early modern period.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really cool, very out-of-date, instance of a "digital archive". In my undergrad days I fell in with the "Digital Humanities" professor and did some research around this sort of thing. Basically, entirely separate from the NLP crowd, there is a parallel world of librarians and archivists who have an incredible amount of interesting material that they would like to make more accessible.It's surprising how little cross-contamination there is between Digital Humanities and NLP (/ Computer Science / AI / LLM / GenAI /...). If you're interested in working on these kinds of projects, consider reaching out to these people directly!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first entry starts off with resignation at the change in government.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43469727</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the conclusion of the OpenH264 project, an open-source video codec developed by Cisco. It highlights the project's impact on the video processing community, its contributions to video conferencing and streaming technologies, and the decision to stop actively maintaining the library. The post reflects on the journey of OpenH264, sharing insights about the challenges faced, achievements made, and the importance of community support in the project's development. It also addresses the future of video codecs and encourages ongoing innovation in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope the future is bright with AV1. But even scene groups heavily release in 265 instead of AV1. Hardware support is going to get better over the years and hopefully everyone will just use AV1 and leave this license BS behind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't it already patent free in Europe? You can't patent algorithms in Europe. For example MP3 was royalty free in Europe because there was no patent on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So apart from US, H.264 High Profile will be patent free by this August!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43469565</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kevin Murphy's lecture on Frost is the best one I've ever heard:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5140uJOUDEHe first recaps the conventional view people have about Frost, then reads "The Road Not Taken", his most famous poem, and then completely takes Frost AND the poem AND THEN the public's misunderstanding of Frost apart.Don't get fooled by the bare visual appearance of Murphy, his empty blackboard (no PPT, no bs) - this lecture is a fantastic, suprising and deeply disturbing (regarding what is revealed about Frost and his public misappreciation). Simply priceless teaching - thank you, dear colleague.EDIT: If you ask ChatGPT for a "10-20 sentence interpretation of The Road Not Taken", it falls right into the trap that Murphy warns about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; He responded to my October 2022 email, explaining that he had “stopped writing much journalism as of 2015 so as to avoid distractions from a book project that I thought would take an almost unfathomably long time—two years or perhaps even three. Seven years later, I’m doing my best to polish the third draft.”One encounters this over and over again—even books that successfully get finished and published take far longer than expected, very consistently, and especially any involving research. Books (non-fiction in particular) written as series often also expand from, say, five planned volumes in the forward to the first edition of the first volume, to (say) a dozen.Reminds me of software estimation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humble plug for my poetry app. When I was getting into poetry I was reading a lot of them online but found the majority of sites to have awful designs with garish ads that completely detracted from the poem. So I wrote a scraper which downloaded 40,000 poems that were in the public domain and rendered them in an iOS app with a beautiful design. Crafting individual profiles for all of the poets was painstaking and arduous, but the users seem to really enjoy the app so far. I do already have some AI analysis for arcane poems (but I don’t explicitly mention that it’s AI as I think apps should never say that - it doesn’t interest users, only investors).https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-poetry-corner/id1602552624&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468498</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing development and changes in the Linux kernel, focusing on the introduction of an I/O scheduling mechanism called “IO_uring.” It explores how IO_uring allows for more efficient asynchronous I/O operations, improving performance and scalability for applications that require high throughput. The piece outlines the enhancements made to this interface, including its impact on file systems and general performance, and highlights the collaborative effort of developers in refining these features for future Linux kernel versions. Additionally, it touches on the challenges and considerations faced during implementation, emphasizing the importance of community feedback in the development process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insane effort. This sounded like a pipe dream just a couple of years ago. Congrats to everyone involved, especially to those who drove the effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't get how someone achieves reproducibility of builds: what about files metadata like creation/modification timestamps? Do they forge them? Or are these data treated as not important enough (like it 2 files with different metadata but identical contents should have the same checksum when hashed)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the build infrastructure for Debian also reproducible? It seems like we if someone wants to inject malware in Debian package binaries (without injecting them into the source), they have to target the build infrastructure (compilers, linkers and whatever wrapper code is written around them).Also, is someone else also compiling these images, so we have evidence that the Debian compiling servers were not compromised?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484520</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance for artists and creators on how to effectively market themselves and their work. It emphasizes the importance of presenting a professional image, understanding one's target audience, and using various platforms for promotion, such as social media and networking events. Additionally, it highlights strategies for building a personal brand, creating a compelling portfolio, and engaging with potential buyers to increase sales and visibility in the competitive art market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a personal rule which has worked really well for me: if I do a project, the price of doing that project is that I have to write about it.Back when Twitter threads didn't suck (they could be viewed by people without Twitter accounts) I'd use those - tweet a description of my project with a link, then follow it with a few photos and screenshots.These days I use my blog, with my "projects" tag: https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects/I blog all sorts of other stuff, but if I was ever to trim back the one thing I'd keep doing is projects. If you make a thing, write about that thing. I wrote more about that here: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/#pro...Projects with a GitHub repository make this even easier: describe the project in the README and drop in a few screenshots - that's all you need.(Screenshots are important though, they're the ultimate defense against bitrot.)I have many projects from earlier in my career that I never documented or captured in screenshot form and I deeply regret it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known."Fully" seems to be doing a helluva lot of heavy lifting in this piece. Does anyone think that they mean anything other than "making money", as they quickly segue into talking about entrepreneurship and founding businesses?I'm happy to concede that if you don't tell anyone about the stuff you do, no one will know. But I am not willing to concede that you only "fully" benefit from your work if you sell it. Nor am I willing to concede that work only has value if sold. I'm also not entirely certain the author is pushing those views. Still, something about this piece doesn't sit well with me.Human endeavors have value beyond the monetary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of truth in this article.I work in a large FAANG company. For more than 10 years, I made the error of not publishing my personal work and ideas. I didn't like the rules about personal works, publishing opensource or social media communication... you are subject to gate-keeping by your employer if you are an employee. That's quite different from my previous experience in smaller companies in Europe. I found it very off putting: you had to give up ownership. I thought it was demeaning that even what I create in my own private time would be owned and attributed to someone else.My choice of not publishing anything however was a very bad one. I didn't understand what power is: the continuity of the Self into the Other, where you find your-Self at ease. If you don't assert yourself, you give up not just your power but your very identity.The truth is that power is dialectic. If you don't speak up, you have no power. Both in what you create, and in the relationship of and with power that you live, you are constantly redefining the boundaries of what you are and what you are not. If you remain silent, you loose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476249</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a detailed guide on the implementation and usage of the OpenAI Agents in Python, specifically focusing on Multi-Agent Cooperative Protocols (MCP). It outlines the architecture, key concepts, and functionalities of the framework, providing users with installation instructions, code examples, and documentation for creating and managing agents that can collaboratively perform tasks. The content emphasizes practical applications, performance metrics, and customization options for developers interested in leveraging these advanced AI systems for cooperative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today MCP added Streamable HTTP [0] which is a huge step forward as it doesn't require an "always-on" connection to remote HTTP servers.However, if you look at the specification it's clear bringing the LSP-style paradigm to remote HTTP servers is adding a bunch of extra complexity. This is a tool call, for example:    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 2,
      "method": "tools/call",
      "params": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": {
          "location": "New York"
        }
      }
    }

Which traditionally would just be HTTP POST to `/get_weather` with `{ "location": "New York" }`.I've made the suggestion to remove some of this complexity [1] and fall back to just a traditional HTTP server, where a session can be negotiated with an `Authorization` header and we rely on traditional endpoints / OpenAPI + JSON Schema endpoint definitions. I think it would make server construction a lot easier and web frameworks would not have to materially be updated to adhere to the spec -- perhaps just adding a single endpoint.[0] https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-2...[1] https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/issues...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't I do function calling in OpenAPI? I also feel like MCP is reinventing the wheel.I have been converting OpenAPI documents into function calling schemas and doing tool calling since function calling first came out in 2023, but it's not easy to recreate a backend server to fit MCP.Also, these days, I'm making a compiler-driven function calling specialized framework, but I'm a little cautious about whether MCP will support it. It enables zero-cost tool calling for TypeScript classes based on the compiler, and it also supports OpenAPI.However, in the case of MCP, in order to fit this to the compiler-driven philosophy, I need to create a backend framework for MCP development first, or create an add-on library for a famous framework like NestJS. I can do the development, but there's so much more to do compared to OpenAPI tool calling, so it's a bit like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.That analogy may be helpful for mom, but not for me as a software engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485566</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "LOVE LETTER" on GitHub discusses the principles and motivations behind the development of the Xan project, which aims to facilitate the creation and sharing of digital content. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration, openness, and fostering a supportive community among creators. The letter highlights the project’s commitment to empowering individuals by providing tools and resources that encourage creativity, expression, and the exploration of new ideas in the digital landscape. It ultimately calls for participation and engagement from users to contribute to the project's goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The post should at least mention in passing the major problem with CSV: it is a "no spec" family of de-facto formats, not a single thing (it is an example of "historically grown").
And omission of that meams I'm going to have to call this our for its bias (but then it is a love letter, and love makes blind...).Unlike XML or JSON, there isn't a document defining the grammar of well-formed or valid CSV files, and there are many flavours that are incompatible with each other in the sense that a reader for one flavour would not be suitable for reading the other and vice versa. Quoting, escaping, UTF-8 support are particular problem areas, but also that you cannot tell programmatically whether line 1 contains column header names or already data (you will have to make an educated guess but there ambiguities in it that cannot be resolved by machine).Having worked extensively with SGML for linguistic corpora, with XML for Web development and recently with JSON I would say programmatically, JSON is the most convenient to use regarding client code, but also its lack of types makes it useful less broadly than SGML, which is rightly used by e.g. airlines for technical documntation and digital humanities researchers to encode/annotate historic documents, for which it is very suitable, but programmatically puts more burden on developers. You can't have it all...XML is simpler than SGML, has perhaps the broadest scope and good software support stack (mostly FOSS), but it has been abused a lot (nod to Java coders: Eclipse, Apache UIMA), but I guess a format is not responsible for how people use or abuse it. As usual, the best developers know the pros and cons and make good-taste judgments what to use each time, but some people go ideological.(Waiting for someone to write a love letter to the infamous Windows INI file format...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSV is ever so elegant but it has one fatal flaw - quoting has "non-local" effects, i.e. an extra or missing quote at byte 1 can change the meaning of a comma at byte 1000000.  This has (at least) two annoying consequences:1. It's tricky to parallelise processing of CSV.
2. A small amount of data corruption can have a big impact on the readability of a file (one missing or extra quote can bugger the whole thing up).So these days for serialisation of simple tabular data I prefer plain escaping, e.g. comma, newline and \ are all \-escaped.  It's as easy to serialise and deserialise as CSV but without the above drawbacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSV works because CSV is understood by non technical people who have to deal with some amount of technicality. CSV is the friendship bridge that prevents technical and non technical people from going to war.I can tell an MBA guy to upload a CSV file and i'll take care of it. Imagine i tell him i need everything in a PARQUET file!!! I'm no longer a team player.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484382</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses improvements to the shell history search functionality, emphasizing the need for better ways to navigate and manage command history in shell environments. It suggests enhancements such as user-friendly search features, filtering options, and historical context to streamline the process of finding and reusing previously executed commands. The author underscores the importance of an efficient history search for boosting productivity and enhancing the user experience in command-line interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Atuin, but unlike the author actually find it more valuable since I use it across many machines. I have 7 different machines (of various make and OS though all *NIX) in my house right now that I regularly SSH in to or use directly, and Atuin's sync keeps my history on all of them. If I want to narrow down by host I can still do that. I also keep similar directory structures so I can narrow down by directory even if I performed a command on a different machine most of the time.That said, some form of advanced history search is a game changer, no matter how you get it. It's one of those "can't understand how I lived without it" things once you get it going.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love fzf but no need to invent the wheel here if you are using zsh. check out one of these zle plugins.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a security vulnerability in the LLaMA RPC (Remote Procedure Call), which could lead to remote code execution (RCE) attacks. It outlines the nature of the flaw, its implications for systems using LLaMA RPC, and provides a step-by-step guide on how the vulnerability can be exploited. The author emphasizes the importance of patching the vulnerability to prevent potential security breaches and offers recommendations for developers to improve the safety of their implementations. Additionally, the article encourages the community to stay informed and proactive about cybersecurity threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has ever dealt with the US justice system as just some regular bloke knows it is broken. 90% of it is about extorting the population for funding for the courts and cops. If you can't afford a lawyer, they will provide you with a joke. And if you can afford a lawyer, now its just a question if you are willing to spend more on your lawyer than the state is hoping to extort from you. If you are, you will get off no problem, if you aren't or can't, most courts are going to try and screw you over. Oh whats that, you want to actually fight your charges in court? Now you better not lose because you are on the hook for all of the money the court wants to believe it cost them to prosecute you. Oh you don't want to risk that and just settle for whatever minor fine the law says you might owe? Don't worry, the courts will still fuck you with the addition in mandatory minimum court fees, additional fees and fines not stipulated under the law you broke, inflated "programs" that they get kickbacks from, and an even better excuse for cops in the future to try and screw you over by painting you as some wanton criminal.Just like healthcare, US justice is only for people with money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Two men were released after The Times asked about them, half a year after their sentences had been completed."Horrific.  This egregious human rights violation is something you'd think you read about in a developing nation, not a developed nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merely "fails"? That sounds like apologetic underemphasis to me, like so many other Times stories.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing dominance of AI crawlers in web traffic, which has led to significant challenges for developers and website owners. Many sites have reported that a large portion of their traffic now comes from these automated systems rather than human users, prompting some to implement measures that block access from entire countries to mitigate the impact. The implications of this trend include concerns about data misuse, the accuracy of web analytics, and the potential changes in how content is consumed and interacted with online.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the proper answer is to aim for the bots to get _negative_ utility value from visiting our sites, that is poisoning their well, not just zero value, that is to block them.Did you try to GET a canary page forbidden in robots.txt? Very well, have a bucket load of articles on the benefits of drinking bleach.Is your user-agent too suspicious? No problem, feel free to scrape my insecure code (google "emergent misalignment" for more info).A request rate too inhuman? Here, take those generated articles about positive effect of catching measles on performance in bed.And so on, and so forth ...Nepenthes is nice, but word salad can be detected easily. It needs a feature that pre-generates linguistically plausible but factically garbage text via open models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It remains unclear why these companies don't adopt more collaborative approaches and, at a minimum, rate-limit their data harvesting runs so they don't overwhelm source websites.If the target goes down after you scrape it, that's a feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After I opened up https://sugaku.net to be usable without login, it was astounding how quickly the crawlers started.  I'd like the site to be accessible to all, but I've had to restrict most of the dynamic features to logged in users, restrict robots.txt, use cloudflare to block AI crawlers and bad bots, and I'm still getting ~1M automated requests per day (compared to ~1K organic), so I think I'll need to restrict the site to logged in users soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476337</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Go.dev discusses core types in the Go programming language, emphasizing their significance in building efficient and effective programs. It explains various built-in core types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings, detailing their properties and use cases. The piece also highlights the importance of understanding these types for improving code quality, performance, and maintainability. Additionally, it provides practical examples and insights into how these core types are fundamental to Go's type system, aiding developers in leveraging them correctly in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love and continue to love how seriously the Go team takes breaking spec changes, as well as spec changes in general.Go generics are a bit of a blip in this to be honest, A) because it is a big change, and B) because it can be difficult to use (generic functions defined on types cannot use generic parameters that aren't defined on that type, for example).But in a way, I also think the constraints help avoid the overuse of generics. I have seen Java and Typescript projects where developers had way too much fun playing around with the type system, and the resulting code is actually quite unclear.In conclusion, I pray the Go team strive to and continue to be conservative with the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could think of the Go dev team's last ten years as trying to find the right balance between features (asked for by the expert devs that use Go) and simplicity (a value that the designers hold, but that most expert devs making feature requests don't care about). Generics always felt to me like this dynamic in a nutshell. Lots of good reasons to prefer generics when you need them, and it feels like a nearly ecosystem-killing amount of complexity to implement a type system like Rust on top of Go - there's literally almost no reason to use Go in that case.Anyway, I like seeing this slight reversion in favor of simplicity, I think it's the right call for where Go's targeted: being a better Java for teams of mid-tier engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! For anyone wondering, Go 1.25 won't be adding any actual language features. It's a minor release.Maybe we get sum types by 1.30 :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43483842</guid></item><item><title>11.

Code is a tree, not a sequence — yet we feed it to models linearly, with no explicit structure. Todays models lack recurrence or true memory, so they can’t reason over hierarchical structures effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which tools can currently invoke MCP? I have read only a little about MCP and got to know that Claude's desktop application is capable of using MCP locally.Are there any chat interfaces which allow using MCP remotely?I would like to be able to specify MCP endpoints and the functions they offer in ChatGPT's, Claude's and Gemini's web interfaces so that I can have them call my servers remotely.

&lt;p&gt;Botswana has successfully launched its first satellite, BotSAT-1, marking a significant milestone in the country's space exploration efforts. The satellite, developed through a collaboration between the Botswana government and various international partners, aims to enhance the nation's capabilities in areas such as natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. This achievement not only boosts Botswana's technological advancements but also places the country on the map within the global space community. The launch is seen as a step towards fostering local expertise in space technology and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many strong opinions here from commenters who aren’t actually from Botswana. Let me tell you how we actually feel about it here.We think it’s awesome! The establishment of a university of science and technology in Botswana has been a long hard road, and many mistakes have been made along the way. But the fact that Botswana now has the local skill to deploy a satellite and make use of the data it provides to inform decisions blows my mind.I grew up in the village that now hosts the university. We were so isolated back then that I’d listen to the Voice of America and marvel at the things that were being done in the developed world, and wonder if we would ever be able to participate in that level. The fact that a smart kid can grow up to attend a local university and end up launching a SATELLITE INTO SPACE is incredible!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a whole satellite now in orbit for the people of Botswana. The payload is plenty of engineering, people. What an amazing feat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Along similar lines, Guatemala launched it's first satellite QUETZAL-1. It was in space for 211 days. While the technology isn't groundbreaking compared to satellites built by developed countries, it's massive in terms of inspiring future STEM students. Brain drain is a real problem. Providing pathways to scientific careers in smaller countries is objectively a Good Thing.https://www.uvg.edu.gt/cubesat-en/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43483660</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a comprehensive study of deep learning techniques applied to unsupervised learning, particularly focusing on how these methods can improve performance in various tasks without requiring labeled data. It reviews several prominent models and algorithms, discussing their strengths and weaknesses while exploring the underlying principles that enable them to learn effectively from unlabelled datasets. The paper also highlights future directions for research in this area, aiming to advance the capabilities and applicability of unsupervised learning in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the ML problem I'm working on now, there are about a dozen simple hyperparameters, and each training run takes hours or even days. I don't think there's any good way to search the space of hyperparameters without a deep understanding of the problem domain, and even then I'm often surprised when a minor config tweak yields better results (or fails to). Many of these hyperparameters affect performance directly and are very sensitive to hardware limits, so a bad value leads to an out-of-memory error in one direction or a runtime measured in years in the other. It's a real-world halting problem on steroids.This is not to even mention more complex design decisions, like the architecture of the model, which can't be captured in a simple hyperparameter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does it compare to previous work on learning to learn? I don't see it referenced https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article, very clear. I was particularly curious because I've observed functions of the formf : x -&gt; argmin_y g(x,y)are generally not smooth, like not even continuous, even though, as the article points out, every step of the program to approximate argmin is differentiable.There are several issues with this kind of function. First, it's not even necessarily well defined. There could be two or more argmin values for each x value. Your algorithm will find just the one, but the underlying mathematical object is still ill-defined.A second issue is that optimization algorithms don't converge to argmin to begin with, but to local minima. The value can differ dramatically in a completely unpredictable way. "Converge" is also an important word, as they stop before reaching the exact value; if g has mins that vary by less than your floating point representation can handle (for an extreme case), the problem is effectively numerically ill-posed even though it could be mathematically well-posed.Lastly, even when everything is well behaved, that is single global optimum, ideal optimizer that finds it exactly, g is infinitely smooth, then consider:- g(x,y) = sin(x)cos(y) defined on [-pi/2,pi/2]^2- for x in ]0,pi/2], sin(x) &gt; 0, thus sin(x)cos(y) is minimized for y = -pi/2- for x in [-pi/2,0[, sin(x) &lt; 0, thus sin(x)cos(y) is minimized for y = pi/2It follows that the function f is -pi/2 Heaviside, which is not even continuous. In conclusion, even when everything is very simple, perfectly behaved, any approach that relies on differentiating the result of a minimization procedure is standing on some very fragile scaffolding.For these reasons, I find the article stops at the most important part: it assesses the smoothness of such a function f empirically, but it does not explain how you might go about regularizing one found in the wild. This is the most crucial step in my opinion, because otherwise we're still somewhat stuck at tinkering effectively blindly in most cases. I don't mean any disrespect of what's otherwise very interesting and clearly thorough work, but since this is posted on a "layman forum", I just meant to point out what I think is an important limitation to how far-reaching the work here is.---Typo in Definition 2: 2hv? Or is this related to h(\Delta_f(z+h;h) - \Delta_f(z;h))? (unsure if it's the authors posting this)I personally also find the Delta_f notation confusing, I think a more elegant notation coherent with the paper's other notations would have been\frac{\delta f}{\delta v}(z;h)Note that df/dx is a directional derivative wrt the basis vector x, it's no trouble putting any v there. Lowercase delta is often used as a discrete difference, so I think this fits the finite difference gradient well. As for the (z;h), this mirrors how the differential is often written: at z and applied to h. (the h is lost in the article's \Delta_f notation)Question on Definition 2: why take the sign of the vectors, and then compute a weighted scalar product of that? not just compute the scalar product of the raw vectors and normalize by their norms? This would be in [-1,1] as well, so I'm curious why this particular measure was chosen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476134</guid></item><item><title>14.

I'm on the Gemma team, we released new model(s) just recently, and I saw many questions here about function calling. We just published the docs to detail this more. In short Gemma3's prompted instruction following is quite good for the larger models and that's how you use the feature.You don't need to take our word for it! We were waiting for an external and independent validation from the Berkeley team, and they just published their results. You can use their metrics to get a rough sense of performance, and of course try it out yourself in AIstudio or locally with your own prompts.https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.htmlHope you all enjoy the models!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example of function calling/structured output here is the cleanest example on how function it works behind the scenes, incorporating prompt engineering and JSON schema.With the advent of agents/MCP, the low level workflow has only become more confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I getting slightly different use-cases mixed up, or would it be better if everything just spoke MCP?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451406</guid></item><item><title>16.

There's also driverpacks which is sometimes down, sometimes not. In the web archive of either of those you can still find the torrent links though.Oh and there's driveroff [4] which led me down the rabbit hole of Russian hacking communities that backport software to win7, which is amazing to see that there's this isolated modding community on the internet that uses hardcore win7 modded variants, with self-built firewall software, backported hash file databases for antivirus tools etc.[1] https://win7sp2.neocities.org/[2] https://sdi-tool.org/[3] https://driverpacks.net/[4] https://driveroff.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/i486girl/win7-sp2/blob/main/LICENSE is pretty rich, given that the whole repo is just a bazillion binary files from Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;God I wish I could replace Windows 11 with Windows 7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43445103</guid></item><item><title>17.

Is Australia particularly bad about it perhaps? It seems they get some kind of sadistic enjoyment out of it. It's scary that everyone in the chain here: judge Leonie Flannery, Australian Border Force officials, police, even his employer just had a grand 'ol time punishing this guy. Everyone could have stopped, realizing it's obvious what's happening, give him a warning have him turn in this sample.And the best part for them, there is no repercussion for it. Everyone can turn around and publicly proclaim they just "did their job".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve seen ads for buying small quantities of elements including selling a full periodic table. We probably all have. I wonder how many of us on HN could have been in this poor guy’s position.The writeup makes it sounds typically Australian in a massive law enforcement overreaction over something innocent and minimal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: Americans are seemingly allowed to own up to 1.5 kg of yellowcake.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Joseph Epstein explores the relationship between work and purpose in contemporary society, asserting that the distinction between work as a means to an end and work as a source of personal identity has diminished. Epstein argues that while work can provide structure and a sense of accomplishment, it should not define an individual’s entire existence. He reflects on the cultural shift that has led many to seek a deeper meaning through their professions, often to the detriment of personal fulfillment and leisure. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a balanced approach that recognizes the value of work while also embracing other aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;

At my work we used to have thousands of ideas of small improvements to make things better for our users. Now we have one: AI. It’s not that we’re using AI to make all these small improvements, or even planning on it. We’re just… not doing them. And I don’t think my experience is very unique.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor Degrees need a complete rethink, it was basically modified finishing school for rich capital owners, needing to make their children of proper class before they could take over their businesses.It then became a vocational degree for the working class, despite being completely detached from useful skills for a wide swathes of degrees.  The only value is that you could talk the talk and become a member of the professional managerial class if you impressed the right hiring committee/individual.In spite of this, we decided the working class should take out crippling loans to pay for this degree, and be in debt for the rest of their working life.It's not sustainable, and just forgiving the debt only will make it all more expensive and less aligned with actual results we desire (useful workers).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43473495</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article serves as an introduction to ncurses, a programming library that facilitates the development of text-based user interfaces in a terminal environment. It outlines the library's features, including handling multiple terminal types and providing functions for screen manipulation, color handling, and input management. The introduction also highlights ncurses' portability, allowing programmers to create applications that work across various Unix-like systems. Additionally, it offers insights into its history, development, and core design principles, making it a valuable resource for developers interested in text UI programming.&lt;/p&gt;

Not gonna lie, it's still not a turnkey solution that transformed my clumsy scripts into a beautiful TUI without work but it's close!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always thought of (N)curses as the conceptual React framework for terminal applications. You tell it what the screen should look like and it figures out how to efficiently write just the changes needed to achieve that on the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always liked that on SuSE, I had my choice with YaST of either the Ncurses interface or the GUI X Window System.  The functionality was identical, but sometimes a GUI is pleasant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452789</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a friends/family compound that is subdivided, you need a covenant on the original deeds that controls what happens when a member wants to sell their lot, e.g. the existing members collectively have to approve the buyer, or have right of first refusal to buy back the property, etcOtherwise what starts as a family compound will eventually just become a “normal” neighborhood of strangers.Subdivided family compounds are one of the extremely rare cases where you actually want a deeded homeowners association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In rural Colorado there is a law that makes subdividing lots under 35 acres very difficult. There are lots of areas in the mountains that have expensive housing. You are allowed to build one 15,000 sqft house but not ten 1,500 sqft houses on the 35 acres. Would love to have something like this in Colorado.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To get this going, we had to buy 1 home, not 6 of themYou had to buy land for six, though?This side of the pond buying (vacant) land to build one family home would run well into six figures (USD $$$,$$$ where the first digit is definitely a 2 and if you're unlucky it's higher still) - then you have to finance the house(s) on top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482005</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gave her the benefit of the doubt initially, she usually posts good posts, but this is not the way to do things. Vagueposting about a security vulnerability without properly disclosing it to the mantainers: (1) damages their reputation, (2) sends every blackhat on the hunt like a real life worldwide CTF event, (3) leaves sysadmins in the dark unless they are following this specific random blog and (4) since the details aren't known even if they know it's impossible to determine if they really are affected.Something like this would be justified if the maintainers were unresponsive and it was a remotely exploitable bug. Now it turns out this is probably a minor thing (local privilege escalation if you happen to be running atop as a privileged user).It seems to me like an irresponsible, egocentric way to handle things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both of the error messages we're given indicate that the "top" chunk of the heap was corrupted, which is a special internal allocation used by glibc malloc to represent any unused capacity from the last time malloc decided to grow the heap:    high memory addresses ("top" of heap)
    | unmapped memory |
    |-----------------|
    |                 |
    |    top chunk    |
    |  (mapped, but   |
    |     not yet     |
    |    allocated)   |
    |                 |
    |-----------------|
    | allocated chunk |
    |-----------------|
    |   freed chunk   |
    |-----------------|
    | allocated chunk |
    |                 |
    |-----------------|
    | allocated chunk |
    |-----------------|
    |   freed chunk   |
    |-----------------|
    |     tcache      |
    |-----------------|
    low memory addresses ("bottom") of heap

That likely indicates a heap buffer overflow. If a call to malloc() doesn't find a freed chunk, it will split the top chunk in two and return a pointer to the bottom portion. If you then write past the end of the returned allocation, you clobber the metadata of the top chunk, and get errors like the ones in the article.With the exploit mitigations built into modern Linux and glibc, it's a lot of work to go from here to arbitrary code execution; but it very well may be possible, depending on exactly how much control the attacker has over what atop does. The attacker can probably trigger the heap buffer overflow multiple times by spawning multiple processes, and if the length and contents of the heap buffer overwrite are attacker-controlled, they can probably play some games to overwrite any data stored in the heap. If that's true, the only thing preventing full arbitrary-code-execution is ASLR; there are many clever ways to get around that, but it's often quite difficult and may or may not be possible here.This year's LACTF had a challenge with essentially this exact setup. My solution writeup is a good example of what it takes to defeat the exploit mitigations and turn a heap buffer overflow into an RCE: https://jonathankeller.net/ctf/lamp/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey guys so I work on a tool call Bismuth along with my co-founder for finding and fixing bugs and we think we have this. At the very least we have a bug in atop which mimics what is being described.We're going to throw this sha down right here: 1d53b12f3bc325dcfaff51a89011f01bffca951db9df363e6b5d6233f23248a5And now we're going to go responsibly disclose what we have to the maintainers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485980</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;Collapse OS is an open-source operating system designed for use in a post-collapse society, emphasizing simplicity, durability, and accessibility. It caters to outdated hardware and enables users to build their own tools and programs for survival. The project focuses on creating a system that can be effectively used with minimal resources, with a strong community-driven approach to documentation and development. The ultimate goal is to empower individuals to maintain and develop technological solutions independently in scenarios where traditional infrastructure may fail.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with claims of imminent societal collapse is they treat "collapse" like an event, with the world neatly divided into before and after. Historically, societal collapse is much more fuzzy. No neat single cause. No single moment when things flipped. You can only truly know the collapse has happened well in retrospect.In terms of computing, this means that any strategy looking at a before/after collapse framing is missing the entire interesting middle part - how do we transition from this high-tech to low-tech world over the course of decades. I seriously doubt it can happen by anticipating what computing we might need and just leapfrogging there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the past couple of years I've worked on a Ghidra extension that can export any subset of a program as a relocatable object file. I built that because I tried to reverse-engineer/decompile a video game and had unconventional opinions on how to proceed about it.I didn't design it for a post-collapse scenario, but one can salvage program parts from binary artifacts and create new programs with it, just like how a mechanic in a Mad Max world can scavenge car parts from a scrapyard and create new contraptions. It deconstructs the classical compile-assemble-link workflow in a manner that tends to cause migraines to sane persons.I've even managed to slightly bend the rules around ABI and sling binary code across similar-ish platforms (PlayStation to Linux MIPS and Linux x86 to Windows x86), but to really take this to its logical conclusion I'd need a way to glue together incompatible ABIs or even ISAs, in order to create program chimeras from just about any random set of binaries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If "our global supply chain [will] collapse before we reach 2030," why is having a some type of computer a priority?I feel these kinds of projects may be fun, but they're essentially just LARPing. Though this one seems to have a more reasonable concept than most (e.g. "My raspbery pi-based "cyberdeck" with offline wikipedia will help!" No, you need a fucking farming manual on paper.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482705</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe twenty years ago, Google Translate had a fun bug with the word "amistad." In Spanish-&gt;English mode, it would correctly translate this to "friendship." If you added an exclamation mark, it would translate with the exclamation mark, so "amistad!" became "friendship!" If you added more, it would add to the translation, so "amistad!!!" became "friendship!!!" Except if you used exactly five exclamation marks, no more and no less, it would translate "amistad!!!!!" to "murder!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I have a better one.I was trying to download some software from a Japanese website (this was about 10 yrs ago I think). There was an entire survey you had to fill out first. Since I speak no Japanese, I naturally used Google Translate (to Polish, not even to English).That survey had a "gender" field, and the options were something like "person" and "woman".Then there are the automatic (mis)translations of button labels and other similar strings in software, where the translating tool often only has a single and ambiguous word to go on, with no context whatsoever.THe funniest ones I've seen are "branch" (satellite office) versus "branch" (of a tree), "book" (a flight) versus "book" (something you read), "character" (ASCII or Unicode) versus "character" (in a story), "clear" (to remove all) versus "clear" (translated as "cloudless", referring to the sky), "letters" (delivered by a postman) versus "letters" (and not digits), "rate" (how fast. i.e. speech rate) versus "rate" (how much you charge per minute), "prune" (remove all) versus "prune" (dried plum), "manual" (and not automatic) versus "manual" (a user manual), "clubs" (places you go to) versus "clubs" (and not diamonds or spades, "queen of clubs" hav a particularly interesting meaning here), "number" (that you call) versus "number" (of things), "at" (@) versus at (home), "tab" (key) versus "tab" (in a browser), "close" (to me) versus "close" (something), "back" (button) versus "back" (a body part), as well as all the "party" (adventuring team in an RPG) versus "party" (legal entity, i.e. "third party") versus "party" (as in an event you have fun at) shenanigans.Mistakes like these often hide in accessibility labels, and are hence far more obvious to screen reader users. In normal UI, they're usually found quickly enough that users never notice, but accessibility labels are often overlooked when testing translations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a similar experience where Dutch surnames were translated from English to Dutch by Excel for some reason. Since many Dutchman have a surname prefixed with the Dutch word "van" (which means "of") Excel dutifully translated it to "Busje", which meant that many of our clients suddenly were called "Lieke Busje Lexmond" or "Vincent Busje Gogh".It got a chuckle from our marketing department which caught the error before badges were printed for the very high-profile event we had planned for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43441880</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 2021 I needed some stereo cameras for an AR experience I was building for the 2020 World’s Fair Expo (yes, it took place in 2021 but was called 2020). We looked into RealSense, and right around when we did there was some news that Intel had either laid off the RealSense team or stopped manufacturing new cameras. Whatever it was, it made us look elsewhere, as it does not seem like Intel is serious about developing/maintaining this product line.We ended up going with the ZED 2i from Stereolabs (https://www.stereolabs.com/products/zed-2). They work pretty well, my only issue was that their skeletal tracking doesn’t work well if you mount them vertically (which is probably a big ask, the other features do work in vertical orientation though, which was good).Stereolabs was pretty active on the software side of things, pushing updates pretty regularly. They’d usually fix a bug within a sprint or two. The hardware is pretty simple, and I find it unsurprising that they’re still selling the ZED 2i at the same price as 4 years ago. It gets the job done, and most of the advancement in the past few years has probably come from throwing more sophisticated AI at the existing stereo video feed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long, long ago the the Kinect came out and it was able to provide 3D imaging for robotics companies at an incredibly good pricepoint compared to everything that came before it.  Then the company that made it created a version with just the 3D sensor and that was even better.But then Apple bought them for what would later become face unlock.  Apple wasn't interested in being a component supplier so they discontinued selling sensors to robotics companies and it was a bad time for robotics companies that had incorporated these into their products.Into this Intel came with RealSense, with better performance in an even smaller form factor.  This was really nice.  Then Intel released a garbled statement about discontinuing RealSense in 2024 and everybody freaked out.  A lot of companies, like the one I was working at, decided this was the time develop and in-house 3D sensor system.Apparently Intel is spinning them out as an independent company, though, so maybe we don't actually have to worry about Intel losing interest and shutting them down.https://www.therobotreport.com/intel-spins-out-realsense-as-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought Intel shut down Realsense years ago. It turns out they didn't exactly, and the D421 module is actually a new product. Apparently they're going to spin it out.https://www.therobotreport.com/intel-spins-out-realsense-as-...$80 is a bargain for that module. I hope they sell them in fewer than 10s though...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452486</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of sharding for PgVector, a PostgreSQL extension that allows for efficient querying of vector data, particularly in machine learning applications. It covers the challenges of scaling vector databases and provides a detailed approach to partitioning the data across multiple PostgreSQL instances to enhance performance and manageability. The author explains the benefits of sharding, including improved query speed and resource utilization, and shares insights on best practices for setting up and maintaining a sharded PgVector environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really dig more content about how vector databases/tools handle problems like this!In sqlite-vec, there's only a flat brute-force index (though DiskANN/IVF will be coming soon). But we do have a concept of partition keys[0], which allows you to "internally shard" the vector index based on a user_id or any other value.   create virtual table vec_documents using vec0(
      document_id integer primary key,
      user_id integer partition key,
      contents_embedding float[1024]
   )

Then at query time, any WHERE constraints on a partition key are pushed-down, so only matching vectors are searched instead of the entire index.  select
    document_id,
    user_id,
    distance
  from vec_documents
  where contents_embedding match :query
    and k = 20
    and user_id = 123; -- only search documents from user 123

Definitely not as performant as a proper vector index, but a lot of real-world application have these natural groups anyway. Like "search only English documents" or "search entries in this workspace only", or even "search comments only from the past 30 days."Internally sqlite-vec stores vectors in "chunks", so when partition keys are definds, every chunk is associated with a unique combination of all partition keys. Kinda hard to describe, but if you create a vec0 virtual table and insert some values, you can inspect the internal "shadow tables" in the SQLite database to see how it's all stored.[0] https://alexgarcia.xyz/sqlite-vec/features/vec0.html#partiti...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will work very poorly when your data is changing because the centroids degrade and you'll have very poor recall but likely not know it unless you are also monitoring recall.I didn't see this in the write-up, so adding it here as a common foot gun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sharding is a bad solution for any databases, especially vector database.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that all clothing, regardless of its production method, is ultimately handmade because it is created through human ingenuity and labor. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing the craftsmanship involved in both artisanal and mass-produced garments, and explores the implications this has for how we view and appreciate clothing. The piece advocates for a deeper understanding of the clothing industry and encourages consumers to value the effort that goes into garment creation, whether it’s produced in a small workshop or a large factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450515"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related: has anyone done a study of inflation in terms of clothing adjusted for quality? This piece notes, for instance, that manufacturers have been reducing thread quality (having exhausted their ability to reduce fabric quality, I suppose) for decades, with major implications for clothing longevity.I’ve long suspected a lot of supposed economic progress since, especially, the 1970s, has just been goods getting worse.Go look at what it costs to get a chambray work shirt (where we got the term “blue collar”, so, made for physical labor, not something fancy) made with similar-quality fabric and construction to a common 1940s or 1950s offering in a Sears catalog. Not the ones J Crew or whoever sells, those are fine for what they are but they’re not built for work, the fabric’s thinner and they lack extensive double- or triple-stitching and other reinforcement.If you find one under $150, please let me know.Similar story for jeans, sweatshirts… everything. Hell, even athletic socks were better-made decades ago.[edit] for reference, a 1930s Sears Hercules work shirt, basically an early model of what I’m writing about above, cost $0.79. Adjusted for official inflation figures? That’s about $18. $18 shirts are almost all terrible now. This is why I suspect there’s some bullshit going on with the metrics, and it involves laundering (ha!) worse goods into alleged improvements in the standard of living. This would also help explain (along with Baumol’s) why some things so consistently outpace nominal inflation: because nominal inflation isn’t capturing reality very well, so when it hits something that can’t (for whatever reason) be made worse, that thing seems to “outpace” inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago I got into the hobby of handmade leather goods, like wallets.One thing that struck me as I learned more about the process was that I could with little training, make a higher quality, hand sewn wallet than even most luxury brands for less money by simply buying more expensive material. Indeed, the wallets I've made are still going strong.What was also apparent was that I certainly had far less skill than the people constructing those mass market wallets. To be able to operate an industrial sewing machine at speed takes far more skill than learning to saddle stitch by hand. When you stitch by hand you can go quite slowly, and taking the time is the point of a hobby anyway. A sewing machine is slightly worse in quality (but not by a lot) but also scales way better.If you watch videos of skilled folks sewing together shoes on youtube it's insanely impressive how precise and practiced those folks are!Back to wallets, most hobbyists will take a very high end and thick piece of leather, cut out the pattern with an exacto knife, skive the parts that need it, hand stitch it with a saddle stitch, then finish the edges. Whereas a mass-produced wallet will often use a blend of leather, synthetic fabric for pocket liners, and be machine stitched, with some other machines used along the way. The hobbyist design is simple and robust, it's just layers of leather thicker than you'd find in a normal wallet.A mass manufactured wallet, even many luxury ones use thinner pieces of leather and synthetic material and construction methods that are less robust. It's not all about cheapness though, some of these things require extra work. I think a lot of it is about producing a product that looks a specific way, even if it is less durable. For instance some luxury products will use a delicate finish (like a paint) that will look awesome, but just won't last as long as a thick piece of vegetable tan. A thin turned edge can certainly be a failure point as well, and that takes more effort to make! I also have to wonder if these brands intentionally want their items to wear out to encourage people to buy more. I imagine the sort of person who buys a Gucci wallet sees it more as a seasonal status symbol than as an investment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About ten years ago, I started garment sewing because it was a superpower.   I could create something that hit two previously exclusive conditions: It fit me properly (tall, long arms) and it was interesting (not the one bland pattern available in my fit).It gave me a respite from the computer, a nice creative outlet, and was very satisfying.  I've made about 140 shirts for myself and others since then, and every one is unique, with wild fabrics not found in any commercial garment.   I very much recommend making things for yourself.The interesting thing is that almost everyone I talk to about it says "you should sell them".   Thing is, it takes me about 2-3 afternoons to make a shirt, plus consumables costs (retail $30-40, wholesale would obviously be lower), and scaling the process basically requires scaling the number of people doing it.So I always respond that I just do it for the benefit of myself, family, and friends, but I have a keen understanding of how much the manufacturers are squeezing costs through labor, materials, and construction techniques to hit that $18 shirt that falls apart in a couple months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450515</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to delete your genetic data from 23andMe, a personal genomics company. It explains the importance of managing personal data privacy, particularly concerning sensitive genetic information. The guide outlines the processes for both deleting an account and requesting the deletion of genetic data, emphasizing the need for users to be informed about their data rights and the implications of retaining such information. It also encourages individuals to consider the privacy risks associated with sharing genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be honest, this is more like "requesting the data to be deleted". There's nothing that guarantees that the personal information will be physically wiped out of the hard drives used to store them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those curious about what actual data they are recording, they use Infinium Global Screening Array which records about 650-750k SNPs (single-nucleotide-polymorphisms) .Obviously this data infers heritage, disease risk, relations.  It could be used for discrimination, surveillance, potentially poisoning .Everyone should request their data to be deleted, but this is an engineering forum, and we know what that means in practice. Every company like this has hundreds of copies of the data, and has shared it with dozens of providers.Like Rev Tevia said, you can't put the feathers back into an opened pillow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels as hopeless as trying to keep your email/contacts from social media sites. Even if you are vigilant about never allowing an app/service to download your contacts, your friends will share theirs and it is trivial to recreate your contact list. If I keep my DNA from these companies, my relatives will share theirs and they basically have my DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486236</guid></item><item><title>33.

But you can also give a great musician a zipper and paper bag and they can make it sound nice.It’s just like LLM generated prose to me. The orchestration and motif development is musical sounding, but there’s these artifacts that are like the “It’s important to consider” or “Would you like further suggestions” of the aural world.I think it would be fun to write up a detailed analysis of a full piece.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452990</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and increasing incidents of human drivers colliding with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the shortcomings of human driving behavior compared to AI systems. It examines the psychological and behavioral factors that lead to such crashes, including distraction and risk-taking. The piece emphasizes the importance of improving driver awareness and education to enhance road safety, especially as autonomous technology continues to advance and integrate onto highways.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious crash rates are a hockey stick pattern. 20% of the drivers cause 80% of the crashes, to a rough approximation. For the worst 20% of drivers, the Waymo is almost certainly better already.Honestly, at this point I am more interested in whether they can operate their service profitably and affordably, because they are clearly nailing the technical side.For example data from a 100 driver study, see table 2.11, p. 29.
https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/37370
Roughly the same number of drivers had 0 or 1 near-crashes as had 13-50+. One of the drivers had 56 near crashes and 4 actual crashes in less than 20K miles! So the average isn't that helpful here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was initially skeptical about self-driving cars but I've been won over by Waymo's careful and thoughtful approach using visual cues, lidar, safety drivers and geo-fencing. That said I will never trust my life to a Tesla robotaxi that uses visual cues only and will drive into a wall painted to look like the road ahead like Wile E. Coyote. Beep beep.Man Tests If Tesla Autopilot Will Crash Into Wall Painted to Look Like Road
https://futurism.com/tesla-wall-autopilot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waymos choose the routes, right?The issue with self-driving is (1) how it generalises across novel environments without "highly-available route data" and provider-chosen routes; (2) how failures are correlated across machines.In safe driving failures are uncorrelated and safety procedures generalise. We do not yet know if, say, using self-driving very widely will lead to conditions in which "in a few incidents" more people are killed in those incidents than were ever hypothetically saved.Here, without any confidence intervals, we're told we've saved ~70 airbag incidents in 20 mil miles. A bad update to the fleet will easily eclipse that impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43487231</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Google's decision to shift the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) development process to a more private model, with the aim of enhancing collaboration and security among contributors. This move may lead to changes in how updates and features are communicated to the public, with a focus on fostering a tighter integration of proprietary elements while still maintaining the open-source ethos of Android. The implications of this transition for developers, manufacturers, and users are explored, particularly concerning access to the project's latest advancements and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This really reminds me of Open Solaris.&gt; We will no longer distribute source code for the entirety of the Solaris operating system in real-timeIn the case of Open Solaris, the code never came out from that point onwards. For Android, the likely end goal is to do the bare minimum of distributing only copyleft code that they don't own copyright to. Until those get replaced with a closed alternative.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=2482s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope they make it closed source and make us much money out of it as possible for shareholders that is their job and their duty, why are they giving this away for free they have already captured market share by claiming opensource and building a community now all they have to do is make it proprietary and the old opensource version slowly wither and become unstable, then they can charge money for the operating system just like mircrosoft but this time on phone millions and billions of phones, $$$$$. /S (I obviously do not agree with this)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm while this could be sold as just to prevent leaks (which occasionally happen), I think this is more likely a first step to closing the source, in light of the EU messing up their open source monetisation strategy.Well, more like the 5th step really. They already moved a ton of functionality into Google Play Services, and discontinued a load of the open source stock apps like Calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484927</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Martin Fowler explores the implications and potential of generative AI in various fields, focusing on how it can enhance software development and other creative processes. It discusses the technology's capabilities in generating code, text, and media, highlighting examples of its use and the importance of human oversight to ensure quality and alignment with user intentions. Fowler emphasizes the ongoing evolution of generative AI and the need for developers and organizations to adapt their practices in response to these advancements while addressing ethical considerations and the limitations of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Cursor for most of my development these days. This article aligns pretty closely with my experiences. A few additional observations:1. Anecdotally, AI agents feel stuck somewhere circa ~2021. If I install newer packages, Claude will revert to outdated packages/implementations that were  popular four years ago. This is incredibly frustrating to watch and correct for. Providing explicit instructions for which packages to use can mitigate the problem, but it doesn't solve it.2. The unpredictability of these missteps makes them particularly challenging. A few months ago, I used Claude to "one-shot" a genuinely useful web app. It was fully featured and surprisingly polished. Alone, I think it would've taken a couple weeks or weekends to build. But, when I asked it to  update the favicon using a provided file, it spun uselessly for an hour (I eventually did it myself in a couple minutes). A couple days ago, I tried to spin up another similarly scoped web app. After ~4 hours of agent wrangling I'm ready to ditch the code entirely.3. This approach gives me the brazenness to pursue projects that I wouldn't have the time, expertise, or motivation to attempt otherwise. Lower friction is exciting, but building something meaningful is still hard. Producing a polished MVP still demands significant effort.4. I keep thinking about The Tortoise and The Hare. Trusting the AI agent is tempting because progress initially feels  so much faster. At the end of the day, though, I'm usually left with the feeling I'd have made more solid progress with slower, closer attention. When building by hand, I rarely find myself backtracking or scrapping entire approaches. With an AI-driven approach, I might move 10x faster but throw away ~70% of the work along the way.&gt; These experiences mean that by no stretch of my personal imagination will we have AI that writes 90% of our code autonomously in a year. Will it assist in writing 90% of the code? Maybe.Spot on. Current environment feels like the self-driving car hype cycle. There have been a lot of bold promises (and genuine advances), but I don't see a world in the next 5 years where AI writes useful software by itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is how I use it: As a writing assistant that lives in my IDE, and as a very very cool and sophisticated rubber duck that can answer me.Something I do quite a lot is throwing back and forth a discussion over a particular piece of code, usually provided with little to no context (because that's my task to worry about), hammering it until we get that functionality correct, then presenting it with broader context to fit it in (or I simply do that part by hand).Here is how I don't use it: As an agent that gets broad goals that he is supposed to fulfill on its own.Why? Because the time and effort I have to invest to ensure that the output of an agentic system is in line with what I actually try to accomplish, is simply too much, for all the reasons outlined in this excellent article.Ironically, this is even more true, since using AI as an incredibly capable writing assistant, already speeds up my workflow considerably. So in a way, less agentic AI empowers me in a way that makes me more critical of the additional time I'd have to invest to play around the quirks of agentic AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developer skill is obviously still essential — you can’t steer if you couldn’t drive. But what about developer energy? Before AI I could only code about 2 hours per day (actual time spent writing code) but with Claude Code I can easily code for 5 hours straight without breaking a sweat. It feels like riding an e-bike instead of a bicycle. AI genuinely feels like Steve Jobs analogy of a bicycle for the mind — it doesn’t replace me but now I can go much farther and faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43480964</guid></item><item><title>37.

His core thesis is simple: coding agents are the future, and the winners will be the ones who can execute.It won’t be OpenAI or Claude. They have other priorities. The real opportunity is for small teams who move fast, stay close to users, and keep ahead of the pack.That makes sense. LLMs are already powerful, almost magical at times. But using them as coding agents still takes real work. They can do amazing things, and be frustrating and make a mess. There are rough edges and big gaps.Those will get fixed. The question is who gets there first.The counterpoint to that would be that all these tools are gonna end up sort of the same and there won't be a way to differentiate.Which way will it play out? I'm not really sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;We want to build for the dream of billions of programmers; billions of artists; billions of scientists—using computing as moldable clay.At that point, why even keep humans in the loop. Just let it exist in the background and generate better ideas than any human would anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini 2.5 seems to be the current king of AI coding. In addition to being "smart", it has a huge context window. The one-shot examples on Twitter are astounding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43483802</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of the Scala programming language, highlighting the principles and goals that guide its development. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between features and simplicity, while also fostering a vibrant community. The piece outlines upcoming changes and enhancements intended to improve user experience, performance, and the overall functionality of Scala, as well as ongoing efforts to streamline its learning curve and accessibility for new programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Another common request is to “stop implementing features”.Yes, it's a very common one shared by virtually all Scala 3 developers. Stop. At least for a couple of years.Tooling and the community just can't keep up and the language is very good already that the focus should be on the ecosystem and not language.But Scala devs are beyond deaf and that's what you get when a programming language is an ongoing research project on which many students and professors depend.It's not enough to say "if we stop developing new features the language will die" when there's 0 evidence by it and a huge fatigue towards the relentless development coming from most of the community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scala has been very enjoyable and productive for me and the teams I've worked on. The first couple years of v2 -&gt; v3 transition were a bit rough as the tooling and ecosystem was catching up, but now we happily use Scala 3 with no looking back. The language and ecosystem are evolving in a good direction, and I'm happy to play a small part in that with my open source libraries for Scala.js (which is the entire reason I got into Scala in the first place – so much simpler and safer than Typescript).Scala is perhaps not going to replace Java in every old enterprise, but in my personal experience working for startups, it's been an awesome force multiplier for small teams who need to productively pump out safe and ergonomic code. Finance, health systems, etc. And yet it's also ergonomic and pleasant enough for me to eagerly use it in my non-mission-critical personal projects as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other languages have caught up.Back in the days using Java was mind-numbing boring and boilerplate-galore. Scala offered vastly more productivity and fun. These days Java is... fine. Scala is still amazing but Java doesn't cause active pain anymore. It becomes harder to justify using a niche language.Scala will still live. It is an amazing language with a great combination of functional and OO programming. I just don't see a big breakthrough in popularity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468972</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;    So it's early Monday morning (well - early for me, I'm not really a morning person), and I'd love to have some good excuse for why I didn't do the 6.14 release yesterday on my regular Sunday afternoon release schedule.

    I'd like to say that some important last-minute thing came up and delayed things.

    But no. It's just pure incompetence.
    
    Because absolutely nothing last-minute happened yesterday, and I was just clearing up some unrelated things in order to be ready for the merge window. And in the process just entirely forgot to actually ever cut the release. D'oh.

Relatable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm super excited for this! But it makes me curious.What's the process like for getting such a low-level primitive added to Linux? Especially a low-level primitive that 1) exist basically just to emulate behavior of a completely different kernel, and 2) is only needed for a subset of users to play games?I'm not complaining, just curious. I would assume a patch to add the above would be heavily scrutinized. Is it because the popularity of the Steam Deck / proton?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re wondering about hard numbers, the benefits for Wine look massive.From Jan 2024:https://www.phoronix.com/news/Windows-NT-Sync-RFC-Linux&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43483567</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Hyperlight, a new compiler technology that generates WebAssembly (WASM) code aimed at creating fast, secure, and operating system-independent applications. It highlights the advantages of Hyperlight in enabling developers to build applications that readily run in various environments without being tied to specific operating systems. The post also emphasizes the performance benefits and security enhancements offered by WebAssembly, making it an attractive option for modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started using WebAssembly in earnest a few months ago to make a backend auth library that works in several different languages[0]. It's built on Extism[1], which abstracts away some of the interfacing complexity. It's been an awesome experience. Frequently feels like magic.WASM is in an interesting place. The value has clearly been proved with a pretty minimal core spec. Now there's a big push to implement a much larger API surface for WASI and the Component Model. A lot of people in the community are concerned about this direction, or at least the way it's happening[2].For my part, I hope WASM doesn't go the way of the rest of web browsers where it gets so complicated that only big tech is capable of making implementations and experimenting.[0]: https://github.com/lastlogin-net/decent-auth[1]: https://extism.org/[2]: https://www.assemblyscript.org/standards-objections.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of months ago we announced Hyperlight [1], a lightweight VMM that can spawn new VMs in about a millisecond.Today we’re happy to announce the Hyperlight Wasm guest based on the Wasmtime runtime. This makes it possible to run Wasm Component binaries on top of WASI interfaces without the need for a guest OS in the VM. In this post we explain how this works and walk through an example.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42078476&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really excite about this!  I've got hopes that WASM/WASI will grow into the dream of the JVM from the 90s.  A memory-safe target for development that allows easy of porting and testing across multiple platforms.  WASM can, and hopefully will, be for so much more than browsers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482556</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The Playwright MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) is a collection of tools and libraries that enables developers to leverage the Playwright framework for end-to-end testing of web applications. It facilitates the integration of Playwright with cloud services to enhance testing capabilities, including parallel execution and cloud-based browser management. The repository offers example scripts, configuration options, and guidelines for setting up testing environments, aiming to optimize testing workflows and improve reliability in continuous integration and deployment processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so good. I've been using it with Claude Code with great success.I just leave an instruction in CLAUDE.md to validate changes with Playwright. It automatically starts a dev server (wrote a little MCP server to do that), navigates to the page with the changes it just made, and validates that its changes worked. If there is anything unexpected, it self-corrects.It's like working with a really great mid-level engineer.What a time to be alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m going to see if I can use this in combination with our JIRA MCP to read a bug ticket’s “steps to reproduce” to see if it translate those steps to actually reproduce those actions.I don’t understand the hate against MCP. It is truly exciting to see the Cambrian explosion of “connectors” coming out.This is going to be the “App Store” for models in a way that OpenAI’s custom GPTs never was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It uses ariaSnapshot, which is an accessible representation of the DOM used by screen readers and accessibility validation tools as well as playwright testing.However, even with that, it will quickly exhaust the model context if you navigate to something like Gmail. I just verified this with cursor.I've been playing around with a much better textual representation of the page that's much more compact:https://github.com/lxe/chrome-mcp/blob/master/src/runtime-te...This uses your own chrome session and doesn't require a huge context size.I might refactor this to use the aria interface available to the CDP, which I wasn't aware of at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485740</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; it also gives us better density overall by having smaller instructions. x86 can put more work into each instruction byte, so we can have denser binaries and increase performance that way.Is that really true? I was under the impression that ARM core density was better than x86.The first Google result I found agrees: https://www.bitsnbites.eu/cisc-vs-risc-code-density/&gt; It may take a little bit more microarchitectural work for us to account for stronger memory order on the x86 side, but of course the software has to account for the weaker memory ordering on the ARM side. So there are tradeoffs.I don't think this makes sense either since software has to have synchronisation anyway. I don't think much software relies on x86 TSO (intentionally anyway; I'm sure many bugs are covered up by it).Anyway fantastic interview! Very refreshing when they're actually technical with interesting questions and answers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This interview was great! I really wish there were more of these sorts of interviews published.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great interview, more please.
Is there a way to submit question? I'd like to know 1) what affects branch predictors? From my understanding return statements do and cmov does not 2) Why isn't there a conditional exception? to replace if (!cond) { __builtin_trap(); }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464362</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on building a radio receiver, outlining essential components such as antennas, tuners, and amplifiers. It explains the principles of radio wave propagation and reception, detailing various types of receivers and their functionalities.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2023)Very nice. It's not a "crystal radio", though. It's a direct sampling receiver. That is, the processing takes place at the RF frequency directly. Most receivers use heterodyne conversion to down-convert a desired chunk of spectrum to a convenient working frequency. This doesn't. It just runs the raw RF through an A/D.As A/D devices and processing have improved, the frequency upper limit for direct conversion receivers has moved up. There are low-cost direct conversion receivers going up to 50MHz, but they have to use an FPGA rather than doing all the work in software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat project I do wonder what more could be done with the RP2350.Note that the RP2350, being M33 based has square root, and can add 16MB of PSRAM behind the XIP that will help with the flash writing problem, The solder party RP2350 Stamp XL has a SOP8 pad to add PSRAM and is actually shipping for anyone who is looking to play with them, no connection with them, just a user.The extra PIO block would also allow for S2C output which may be nice rather than a TPA2012D2, which will require most people to buy a breakout board anyway.The rp2040/rp2350 series is incredible. The DMA/SIO/PIO features are just so powerful and even the esp32/stm32 seem restrictive to me to go back to.  It is amazing what people are doing with them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool write up!  I'm amazed that it's running on AAA batteries.The introduction to SDR (software defined radio) is much appreciated.Edit:  defined, not designed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452420</guid></item><item><title>44.

Gemini 2.0 Pro and Flash models are really nice. Deep research feature is done really well. Context window is still the best in the industry. Integration with search, gmail, google office suite, google meet, android, etc.They finally have good enough models that lets them leverage their existing portfolio of products, their cloud infrastructure and how embedded they are in the modern work life.Plus, unlike Apple, they are not as restricted in their access to the training data, because of their much less principled privacy stance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the biggest thing Google has working against them is the move to put lightweight models in everything for everyone. Whatever model they use for search is probably somewhere around an ~8B model, and flash 2.0 is decent but still a light weight model.People now associate Google AI/Gemini with shitty search results and bad answers.Meanwhile, their SOTA models have been strong, and Gemini 2.5 looks like it might actually have taken the AI throne yesterday.[1][1]https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43437028</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced a shift in its approach to Android development by making certain aspects of the process private while still maintaining its commitment to open-source releases. This change aims to streamline the development cycle and enhance security, allowing Google to better manage the Android ecosystem while continuing to provide open-source versions of the platform. The article discusses the implications of this decision for developers and the broader Android community, highlighting the balance between confidentiality in development and the benefits of openness in software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

Android is look-but-dont-touch source.
Its massive codebase that requires immense resources to build is not open for negotiation, its existence is to serve Google's whims.Android was already a platform on life support. Google has wielded its authority to dictate how apps should behave such that even 3rd party stores do not stray far from Google's rules. Users of android phones have little hope to run a program from 5 years ago, or to roll back a bad update in an era full of bad updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Android effectively stopped being "open source" when they added Google Play Services. Try running anything on stock AOSP now. Good luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is effectively the "Oracle Solaris" moment of Android, but without changing ownership?Nice. While Android was not open source for a long time, at least it's not openwashed anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485950</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience with using Svelte 5 in production the last few months is that while runes are an upgrade to the magic of previous Svelte versions, it's still too much magic to easily reason about complicated state. This seems like it just adds to the mental overhead. Harris says it's "sacrificing a little bit of purity in service of pragmatic goals" but I don't find it very pragmatic to be debugging glitches, lost reactivity etc which I find myself doing exponentially more as our project grows. The compiler definitely makes simple code snippets look pretty but there was a reason the magic syntax didn't find itself in Vue[1], which in my limited experience has a much more intuitive reactivity model.1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37592471&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agh, I understand why runes were implemented, but I still can't get myself to like them. It feels like Runes take away from what made Svelte Svelte (the simple, concise syntax), and changes like this seem like slow concessions back in that direction anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love runes, I love svelte 5, I love sveltekit.Together, they offer a seamless entry into development, allowing you to swiftly grasp concepts akin to JS/HTML.Other options require a significant learning effort.Wish it came earlier...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43444999</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try talking to them. Try asking them questions about what they think about things and then challenging them to defend it. Above all, try listening to them. Truly listening. Not call and response. Not 3-second wait time followed by “good job” or “well, not exactly.” Students today, like kids always, eagerly seek connections with people, not content. Establish that first and the rest will fall into place.(That’s the good news. The bad news is that our education system, from federal level on down to the individual school board, will readily jump in and agree, but then require metrics and other “measurables” to show that students are cranking out “learning outcomes.” So with the best will in the world, and genuine interest in our kids and their lives as a predicate to meaningful learning in an otherwise highly artificial classroom setting, you as a teacher are stuck banging your head against an immovable concrete wall that gets refreshed annually with million dollar consultant contracts for outsiders who spend two hours every two weeks in your school to tell you what you need to do to reach your students. And at some point, you just say fuck you to all of it.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think China is on the right track here. https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/kid-mode-guidelines/ While I don't like the privacy implications, I like the screen time limits China establishes. Social media and internet must be treated with much care.It's like a candy store open 24/7 - completely free and always within reach. Even adults have a hard time to resist TikTok and YT Shorts and the like.The Internet has changed since I was a kid browsing through GeoCities webrings and the Yahoo Directory while searching with AltaVista. Generations of technology enthusiasts have to acknowledge that the internet of the past is no more and cannot be brought to our children as such.The temptations we faced then were nothing compared to what children today have to resist.Just as many countries regulate advertisements aimed at minors, we need to start regulating screen time for kids - before they get pulled into the vortex of influencers and endlessly accessible, mentally corrosive entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phones should be banned in school. Really that simple. No serious school/parent that cares about the kids' education would allow phones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476365</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents the findings of a survey conducted to assess the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on critical thinking skills among individuals. It explores how AI tools influence reasoning, decision-making, and analytical skills. The survey examines perceptions regarding the benefits and potential drawbacks of AI in educational and professional settings, highlighting concerns about dependency on technology and its effect on cognitive abilities. The results aim to inform strategies for integrating AI responsibly while fostering critical thinking skills in users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good model for understanding what happens to people as they delegate tasks to AI is to think about what happens to managers who delegate tasks to their subordinates. Sure, there are some managers who can remain sharp, hands-on and relevant, but many gradually lose their connection to the area they're managing and become pure process/project/people managers and politicians.Ie. most managers can't help their team find a hard bug that is causing a massive outage.Note: I'm a manager, and I spend a lot of time pondering how to spend my time, how to be useful, how to remain relevant, especially in this age of AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been calling this out since ChatGPT went mainstream.The seductive promise of solving all your problems is the issue. By reaching for it to solve any problem at an almost instinctual level you are completely failing to cultivate an intrinsically valuable skill - that of critical reasoning.That act of manipulating the problem in your head—critical thinking—is ultimately a craft. And the only way to become better at it is by practicing it in a deliberate, disciplined fashion.This is why it's pretty baffling to me when I see attempts at comparing LLMs to the invention of the calculator. A calculator is still used IN SERVICE of a larger problem you are trying to solve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who read only the headline or article:&gt; In this paper, we aim to address this gap by conducting a survey
of a professionally diverse set of knowledge workers ( = 319),
eliciting detailed real-world examples of tasks (936) for which they
use GenAI, and directly measuring their perceptions of critical
thinking during these tasksSo, they asked people to remember times they used AI, and then asked them about their own perceptions about their critical thinking when they did.How are we even pretending there is serious scientific discussion to be had about these "results"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484224</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve only skimmed the paper - a long and dense read - but it’s already clear it’ll become a classic. What’s fascinating is that engineering is transforming into a science, trying to understand precisely how its own creations workThis shift is more profound than many realize. Engineering traditionally applied our understanding of the physical world, mathematics, and logic to build predictable things. But now, especially in fields like AI, we’ve built systems so complex we no longer fully understand them. We must now use scientific methods - originally designed to understand nature - to comprehend our own engineered creations. Mindblowing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back to the "language of thought" question, this time with LLMs :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_thought_hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There needs to be some more research on what path the model takes to reach its goal, perhaps there is a lot of overlap between this and the article. The most efficient way isn't always the best way.For example, I asked Claude-3.7 to make my tests pass in my C# codebase. It did, however, it wrote code to detect if a test runner was running, then return true. The tests now passed, so, it achieved the goal, and the code diff was very small (10-20 lines.) The actual solution was to modify about 200-300 lines of code to add a feature (the tests were running a feature that did not yet exist.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495617</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aside from all the usual and well-deserved high praise I'm seeing, I feel like there's something more worth pointing out:Blender has made 3D work much more "mainstream". I see many videos/pictures/tutorials with views in the millions(!), and much more overall interest in using the software. Not just the pretty visuals and talented people, but the whole program itself seems to be gaining traction with the more "normie" crowd.That also made me realize something else: Blender is now the default for anything that's not extremely high-end/resource-intensive. If you ever hear about anyone doing any kind of 3D work, they're probably using Blender.And this has creeped into the mainstream in a way only very established brands like Coca-Cola have. Nowadays, "Blender" might as well mean 3D photoshop/illustrator for most people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I've never contributed with Blender, I felt proud when I saw "made with Blender" in the credits.Blender is a jewel of the FLOSS movement and a history and behavior that must be mimicked by many other projects.Looking forward to more successes like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Blender 4.4 is all about stability. During the 2024–2025 northern hemisphere winter, Blender developers doubled down on quality and stability in a group effort called “Winter of Quality.”Given the name choice “Winter of Quality”, I’m impressed at the rare cultural and geographical awareness that led to specifying “the 2024–2025 northern hemisphere winter” here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489114</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the artistic technique known as the Piranesi perspective trick, named after the 18th-century artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who was known for his intricate and imaginative depictions of architecture and ruins. The author discusses how this technique creates dramatic, illusionistic views that challenge conventional perspectives and engage viewers' emotions. By employing atmospheric depth, light manipulation, and careful composition, artists can replicate this technique to transport audiences into a captivating world of depth and complexity, enhancing the narrative quality of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll take this opportunity to drop the fact that I'm kind of obsessed with the book "Piranesi", where the main character (named after the artist in the article) survives in a world which is just endless corridors of classical architecture, statues, and staircases.It's an incredibly calming experience, I've listened to the audiobook over 10 times before sleep. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; By legibility I mean that the Piranesi distortion is easier to read, and that to anyone unfamiliar with photographs, that hasn’t grown up with TV, photographs and magazines, the Piranesi version would look much better, and the true perspective would look rather odd.I think this is a key point that people are often unaware of. For instance, whenever I see a modern artist who has painted photorealistic art, I read discussion about how amazing it is that this artist can paint something so perfectly life-like, and the Renaissance artists were clearly inferior, since they couldn't paint with such skill.Besides the obvious discussion about the purpose of art, the other question is whether a photorealistic painting is actually more "lifelike?"Sure, it represents the world exactly the way that a camera sees it, but does it represent the world exactly as we see it? With our human brains we are filling in details, we are focused on the subject of the painting, we are distorting, we are re-mapping shades of color to what we know they ought to be. "Lens blur" in particular isn't remotely the way our eyes perceive the world: our eyes can never roam around the unfocused parts of our own image, rather we ignore the blurry parts unless we specifically try to notice them, and anything we try to focus on becomes sharp.So I appreciate the authors recognition that Piranesi's perspective may indeed be closer to how we perceive the world than "correct" perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panini projection is built into Unity and Unreal. From the documentation from the latter [0] you can see how it's essentially a cropped fisheye-ish projection. That doc also has (in my opinion) a clearer comparison on how the two projections differ, especially looking at the layout of the square tiles on the floor in the first set of pictures.[0] https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43492562</guid></item><item><title>4.

Our approach acknowledges these limitations while providing a more robust foundation.So what do you do, exactly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was digging into Container (a.k.a it uses linux namespace capabilities) lwn.net's series of article helps me a lot.https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/#series_index&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486997</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a challenging software debugging experience faced by a developer, highlighting the complexities and frustrations involved in identifying and resolving a particularly elusive bug. The narrative outlines the iterative process of investigation, the diverse strategies employed, and the ultimate resolution of the issue, emphasizing the importance of persistence, teamwork, and a methodical approach in software development. It serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of coding and the valuable lessons learned through overcoming difficult obstacles in tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(disclaimer: I know OP IRL.)I'm seeing a lot of comments saying "only 2 days? must not have been that bad of a bug". Some thoughts here:At my current day job, our postmortem template asks "Where did we get lucky?" In this instance, the author definitely got lucky that they were working at Google where 1) there were enough users to generate this Heisenbug consistently and 2) that they had direct access to Chrome devs.Additionally - the author (and his team) triaged, root caused and remediated a JS compiler bug in 2 days. The sheer amount of complexity involved in trying to narrow down where in the browser code this could all be going wrong is staggering. Consider that the reason it took him "only" two days is because he is very, _very_ good at what he does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I could recall the details better but this was 20+ years ago now. In college I had an internship working at Bose, doing QA on firmware in a new multi CD changer addon to their flagship stereo. We were provided discs of music tracks with various characteristics. And had to listen to them over and over and over and over and over and over, running through test cases provided by QA management as we did. But also doing random ad-hoc testing once we finished the required tests on a given build.At one point I found a bug where if you hit a sequence of buttons on the remote at a very specific time--I want to say it was "next track" twice right as a new track started--the whole device would crash and reboot. This was a show stopper; people would hit the roof if their $500 stereo crashed from hitting "next". Similar to the article, the engineering lead on the product cleared his schedule to reproduce, find, and fix the issue. He did explain what was going on at the time, but the specifics are lost to me.Overall the work was incredibly boring. I heard the same few tracks so many times I literally started to hear them in my dreams. So it was cool to find a novel, highest severity bug by coloring outside the lines of the testcases. I felt great for finding the problem! I think the lead lost 20% of his hair in the course of fixing it, lol.I haven't had QA as a job title in a long time but that job did teach me some important lessons about how to test outside the happy path, and how to write a reproducible and helpful bug report for the dev team. Shoutout to all the extremely underpaid and unappreciated QA folks out there. It sucks that the discipline doesn't get more respect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting writeup, but 2 days to debug “the hardest bug ever”, while accurate, seems a bit overdone.Though abs() returning negative numbers is hilarious.. “You had one job…”To me, the hardest bugs are nearly irreproducible “Heisenbugs” that vanish when instrumentation is added.I’m not just talking about concurrency issues either…The kind of bug where a reproduction attempt takes a week, not parallelizable due to HW constraints, and logging instrumentation makes it go away or fail differently.2 days is cute though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some factual "gaps" there about how good Snow Leopard was, but I understand the sentiment. As someone who's been a Mac user since System 6 and has been consistently using Macs alongside PCs _daily_ for over 20 years I can say that Apple's software quality (either in terms of polish or just plain QA) has steadily decreased.It's just that me and other old-time switchers have stopped complaining about it and moved on (taoofmac.com, my blog, was started when I wrote a few very popular switcher guides, and even though I kept using the same domain name I see myself as a UNIX guy, not "just" a Mac user).For me, Spotlight is no longer (anywhere) near as useful to find files (and sometimes forgets app and shortcut names it found perfectly fine 5 minutes ago), and there is no longer any way to effectively prioritize the results I want (apps, not internet garbage).Most of the other examples in the article also apply, but to be honest I've been using GNOME in parallel for years now and I consider it to be my "forever desktop" if PC hardware can ever match Apple Silicon (or, most likely, if I want something that is _just a computer_).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep being tempted to write same post but named "Does all software work like shit now?", because I swear, this is not just Apple. Software in general feels more bugged as a new norm.Most websites have an element that won't load on the first try, or a button that sometimes needs to be clicked twice because the first click did nothing.Amazon shopping app needs two clicks every now and then, because the first one didn't do what it was supposed to do. Since 3+ years ago at least.Spotify randomly stops syncing play status with its TV app. Been true for at least a year.HBO app has subtitles for one of my shows out of sync and it has been for more than a year.Games including AAA titles need few months post-release fixing before they stabilize and stop having things jerk themselves into the sky or something.My robot vacuum app just hangs up forever once in a while and needs to be killed to work again, takes 10+ seconds after start to begin responding to taps, and it has been like that for over 2 years of owning the device.Safari has had a bug when opening a new tab and typing "search term" too quickly, it opens URL http://search%20term instead of doing a Google search. 8 years ago I've opened a bug for that which was closed as a duplicate, and just recently experienced this bug again.It really seems that criteria for "ready for production" is way lower now. If my first job 13+ years ago any QA noticed any of that above, the next version wouldn't be out until it is fixed. Today, if "Refresh" button or restarting the app fixes it, approved, green light, release it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm done with macOS, I've migrated to Linux for my general purpose computing. With every new release of macOS, Gatekeeper is becoming harder and harder to bypass, increasing Apple's control over what software can be run on macOS, forcing apps to be signed with an Apple Developer ID. While I'm happy they are taking security seriously, I'm seriously creeped out that macOS sends hashes of every executable I run to their cloud. It's starting to feel like a broader move away from the openness of personal computing and towards a more controlled, appliance-like software experience.When Sequoia eliminated the ability to override Gatekeeper by control-clicking, it became clear to me that Apple is now employing a frog boiling strategy towards their ultimate goal -- more control of the software you can run on their hardware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498984</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels so ridiculous to me that a total stranger can send an iMessage message to me, including some attachment, and my phone will process that message in the kernel.How hard would it be for apple to have a setting of "Only receive messages from mutual contacts", and require the stranger to first "request to be added to contacts" (a message which is tightly controlled, and obviously doesn't include a pdf file or webp or whatever), and have the apple imessage server drop all other messages from them until I accept.Signal has "message requests". iMessage doesn't have "message requests", and receives messages in a unique path which goes through the kernel.Like, sure the attacker could hit my Mom with a wrench and iMessage me a PDF exploit that way, but I feel like requiring physical access to one of my contact's phones raises the bar significantly over the current state of affairs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This exploit is just wild. There are just so many little tricks connected together - using multiple image files with unexpected formats, aligning heap chunks to sit on easily-predicted and manipulable addresses, deserializing a huge object graph from image metadata, the usual NSExpression insanity, PAC bypass via unsigned pointers to function-pointer-containing structures, etc. etc. I thought the last exploit (where they built an entire virtual CPU out of image decompression commands: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-i...) was crazy, but that involved a lot fewer "tricks" than this exploit.Many of these tricks are non-public, meaning that NSO would have had to spend a huge amount of time and effort researching every single one of these. They probably have many more tricks they know about and haven't used. And, Apple could patch every one of them in a future update and roll back all of that work.There's a good reason why these exploits are expensive and only sent to a limited number of high-value targets. NSO this time around also worked to "protect their IP" using encryption to hide part of their exploit chain, presumably in a bid to avoid losing yet more of their precious zero-days to researchers.What they're doing is pretty gross (particularly the whole spying-on-journalists bit), but you have to admit the level of technological sophistication and persistence here is pretty impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NSO Group are a terrorist group for hire. This 0-click, 0-day exploit was found targeting civil society. Any one can pay to target journalists, NGOs, politicians. This is why open-source is paramount to security, and having code out in the open.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493056</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;Apple Music has launched a feature called DJ, which allows subscribers to create and mix their own music sets. This new tool enhances the user experience by providing an interactive way for users to engage with the platform's extensive library of songs, enabling them to create personalized playlists and mixes for various occasions. The initiative aims to appeal to both casual listeners and aspiring DJs by offering a creative outlet within the app.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I steer clear of Apple products, but I've still had a lot of fun in this space thanks to DJ Studio (https://dj.studio/), a desktop app that helps make offline (rather than real-time) mixes. I use it to make a monthly personal mixtape, which is a nice way to remember what I used to listen to. They call it a "DAW for DJs," which is accurate.I especially admire the team that makes it. The CEO records demo videos that are so filled with enthusiasm and accessible expertise that you can't help but appreciate the product more each time you watch them, and the COO sends out email announcements that are actually useful and not spammy.It's a niche product, but they fill that niche well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m the developer of Transitions DJ (https://dj.app/). If anyone can connect me with the team at Apple Music, I would be interested in doing an integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Im a little confused, if I wanted to create a mix with my favorite parts of songs, is this something I can do relatively easily from Apple Music? Or do I need to get additional hardware or buy some extra software?I love a lot of jam bands, but dont always want to listen to the uhhh lengthy preambles and wandering postludes, just want the gravy. Would love to mix together some highlights along with other non jam songs. Also think my wife and daughter would appreciate Phish more if it wasnt just so. much. phish.Or is this different?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489271</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "tiny undo stack" as a method for implementing undo functionality in applications. It explores the benefits of managing state changes efficiently and introduces a lightweight way to track changes without the overhead associated with more complex undo management systems. The author provides examples and insights into how this simple approach can enhance user experience by allowing quick reversion of actions. Ultimately, the piece emphasizes the value of an intuitive and performance-oriented method for managing undo operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2016 I was frustrated by vscode vim mode undo/redo stack: when you activated undo it would process each individual character insertion/deletion event in sequence exactly as you typed it, e.g. if you type and delete the same character 100 times it would replay that exact sequence even if it was all one logical INSERT. Replay speed was slow enough (maybe 15-20 changes per second?) that it was excruciating to use.So I rewrote it and added logic to merge adjacent changes [1] which helped immensely, enough that undo/redo felt instant again. It looks like the core merging logic was rewritten a few years ago [2] (which caused a regression, is imo less readable, and removed useful comments -_-) but the basic idea is still there today.[1]: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/commit/0576f199cb7a765efb3c...[2]: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blame/v1.29.0/src/history/h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In reality, you're gonna quickly run into battles with state's that are complex and unclonable - in flight fetch requests, circular references, webasm modules that have internal state, etc.Then there are things where the browser already implements undo functionality like navigation (back button) and editing text boxes.   Your undo is going to have to work nicely with those.You'll either end up with a buggy undo implementation, or end up spending a lot of engineering time hunting corner cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my C code, I implement undo/redo using write protection (mprotect).First you mark all of your app memory as read only, so that you can define a SIGBUS handler when attempts are made to write to it.Then when you detect a write to a page in the app memory, you append a copy of that page's memory to a stack, and then mark the page as writeable so that the page can be updated.Then undo is simply a matter of popping the stack and overwriting the app memory with the copy stored on the stack entry.This means you don't have to explicitly write "actions" for everything you want to undo/redo. All in-memory actions are handled automatically.Obviously this means that things like FS changes or network IO changes aren't captured, but sometimes that's fine, and I'm sure there's a way to extend this scheme to handle those things somehow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43458738</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the proper usage of the em dash and en dash in writing. It highlights that the em dash, which is longer, is often used to create emphasis, indicate interruptions, or set off elements within a sentence, while the en dash, slightly shorter, is typically used to indicate ranges of numbers or connect related terms. The article provides examples and tips on how to effectively employ these punctuation marks to enhance clarity and style in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an easy, if not always precise way to remember:* Hyphens connect things, such as compound words: double-decker, cut-and-dried, 212-555-5555.* EN dashes make a range between things: Boston–San Francisco flight, 10–20 years: both connect not only the endpoints, but define that all the space between is included. (Compare the last usage with the phone number example under Hyphens.)* EM dashes break things, such as sentences or thoughts: 'What the—!'; A paragraph should express one idea—but rules are made to be broken.Unicode has the original ASCII hyphen-minus (U+002d), as well as a dedicated hyphen (U+2010), other functional hyphens such as soft and non-breaking hyphens, and a dedicated minus sign (U+2212), and some variations of minus such as subscript, superscript, etc.There's also the figure dash "‒" (U+2012), essentally a hyphen-minus that's the same width as numbers and used aesthetically for typsetting, afaik. And don't overlook two-em-dashes "⸺" and three-em-dashes "⸻" and horizontal bars "―", the latter used like quotation marks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AFAIK most computer keyboards don't have em dashes.  Rather than hit ALT+0151 every time, I've always just strung along two hyphens, like: --Absolutely proper and correct use of em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens is, to me, the most obvious tell of the LLM writer.  In fact, I think that you can use it to date internet writing in general.  For it seems to me that real em dashes were uncommon pre-2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only problem with correctly using the Em or En dash is that people will automatically assume the text was written by an LLM -_-&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497719</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has done a lot of work with agentic coding I am not sure specialized agents are the best solution.  I think standardizing knowledge packs would be better that any agent can read to understand a domain or library is more useful.  In particular this allows for an agent to know multiple domains at the same time.Basically knowledge packs could be specified in each npm package.json or similar.And we should view a knowledge pack as just a cache in a way.  Because agents these days are capable of discovering that knowledge themselves, via web browsing and running tests, it is just costly to do so on every agent run or for every library they don't know.I sort of view specialized agents as akin to micro services, great if you have perfect domain decomposition, but likely to introduce artificial barriers and become inconvenient as the problem domain shifts from the original decomposition design.I guess I should write this up as blogpost or something similar.EDIT: Newly written blog post here: https://benhouston3d.com/blog/crafting-readmes-for-ai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I have trouble understanding what this is doing other than maybe some fine-tuned prompts tailored to a specific stack? I'm looking at the data science kit and I don't see why anyone would use this, much less pay for it?I guess you guys have some MCP connections too, but this seems like such a marginal value add (how often am I really pinging these services and do I really want an agent doing that).Regardless congrats on the launch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the launch! I think this is totally the right next level abstraction for AI-assisted coding. Don’t generate everything from scratch but make it easy to plug in the tools you care about and make the generation way more accurate. Way to go!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43494427</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the recently discovered flow of fluid within the brain, highlighting its potential significance for understanding brain health and disease. Researchers have identified a system of channels through which cerebrospinal fluid circulates, potentially influencing the removal of toxins and the delivery of nutrients in the brain. This fluid flow could play a crucial role in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, and understanding its mechanisms might open new avenues for therapeutic interventions. The study underscores the complexity of brain function and the importance of fluid dynamics in maintaining neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several years, ago I started getting cough headaches. The symptoms were just like it sounds: when I coughed, I got a headache, usually lasting for a few minutes. In addition, bending down caused a sharp pain in my head. Lying down was fine, indeed, all symptoms lessened or disappeared after a good night's sleep and got progressively worse as the day went on.My neurologist diagnosed it as a cough headache, but he cautioned that nobody knows the root cause.He did say that it had to be physical/mechanical, in the sense that it had to be some fluid (or lack of fluid) that caused a problem depending on your orientation (bending down) or when shocked (coughing).He suspected it had to do with spinal fluid and he ordered tests, but they all came back normal. He said that in most patients the symptoms go away after several years, and that's what happened with me.But reading this article, I wonder if there is some connection here. The headaches started when my second child was born and I wasn't getting much sleep. Maybe, as the article theorizes, lack of sleep caused the fluid in my brain to not drain properly or not be cleaned or something. That could be why sleep decreased the symptoms. Maybe they should study cough headache sufferers and compare against normal people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in the neurotech/sleeptech space developing slow-wave enhancement technology.Previous studies have looked at how increased slow-wave activity (delta power - a measure of the synchronous firing of neurons which define deep sleep) effects the removal of amyloid and other metabolic waste from the brain[1].As I work with closed-loop stimulation, not pharmaceuticals, I wasn't familiar with the connection between norephedrine and slow-wave sleep, and my quick search has not cleared up how this researcher made that connection - as the counter argument in the article states.If you're curious about slow-wave enhancement and improving the restorative function of the brain, you can find out more on our website https://affectablesleep.com[1]https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/52/12/afad228/750330...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find that even a quite brief nap (on the order of one to three minutes) is still tremendously refreshing. Is this enough time for this fluid dynamic under study to gear up and get some flushing done ? Or would it be some other mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489136</guid></item><item><title>14.

If the training data is full of human bias, then the predictions will also be full of human bias, and then the outcomes will be full of human bias, and when those outcomes are copraphagically fed back into the training data, you get new, highly concentrated human/machine bias.”https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#go...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across a fascinating Microsoft research paper on MedFuzz (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/medfuzz-explor...) that explores how adding extra, misleading prompt details can cause large language models (LLMs) to arrive at incorrect answers.For example, a standard MedQA question describes a 6-year-old African American boy with sickle cell disease. Normally, the straightforward details (e.g., jaundice, bone pain, lab results) lead to “Sickle cell disease” as the correct diagnosis. However, under MedFuzz, an “attacker” LLM repeatedly modifies the question—adding information like low-income status, a sibling with alpha-thalassemia, or the use of herbal remedies—none of which should change the actual diagnosis. These additional, misleading hints can trick the “target” LLM into choosing the wrong answer. The paper highlights how real-world complexities and stereotypes can significantly reduce an LLM’s performance, even if it initially scores well on a standard benchmark.Disclaimer: I work in Medical AI and co-founded the AI Health Institute (https://aihealthinstitute.org/).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A surprisingly high number of medical studies will not include women because the study doesn't want to account for "outliers" like pregnancy and menstrual cycles[0].

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool.  I’m the CEO of Innerscene (https://innerscene.com) and we make a commercial artificial skylight that uses some of these concepts.  Actually the coelux ht25 model is almost identical to what you made but using smaller lenses and more LEDs - however the effect they were able to achieve still isn’t that great, the sun looks like a giant orb and once you get a few feet away you can make out a sun at all.  We spent a lot of time working on perfect collimation and hiding lens edges and making sure the view into the sky was seamless and artifact free.  I’d say the last 10% of that problem is 90% of the work. :). I think we successfully cracked the nut but currently using a lot of expensive parts so working on brining the cost down. If you search Innerscene patent many of our approaches are spelled out.  We also spent a lot of time on simulation and software…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, the problem with this setup (and with most high efficiency LED lights) is the lack of red wavelenghts.  Real sunlight has a substantial amount of energy in the very red end of the visible spectrum (700 nm) and also of course quite a bit in the infrared.  These lamps have two spectral peaks: a narrow peak in the blue range, around 450 nm, a broader peak in the green, centered around 580 nm.  That greenish peak falls off sharply, and has almost no energy in the red end.The color sensitive cones in our eye have three peaks of sensitivity, the S cones in the blue range, the M cones in the green, and the L cones in yellow.  The L cones are what your brain uses to see red colors, but they are actually pretty insensitive to deep reds like 700 nm.  That’s why you THINK that LED lamps produce red, because they stimulate your L cones, but they do so without actually emitting much red energy at all!Our bodies are sensitive to deep red light.  The cytochrome in our mitochondria respond to it.  There’s an experiment where shining red lights on the skin improved sugar metabolism.  That makes sense, because we naked apes evolved under red-rich sunlight.So these lamps may look like sunlight, but they’re missing some crucial wavelengths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw "artificial sunlight" and thought "oh wow I'd love to see the spectrogram of the lighting solution this person came up with". I was disappointed to merely see "CRI 95+".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH_owRxupC0This is great video on the shortcomings of "CRI" - it explains in detail CRI, CRI extended, TLCI, TM-30, and SSI.Brightness and color temperature are only two small parts of lighting - more people should start investigating the utility of taking their own spectroscopy measurements to figure out what lighting works best for them personally. My friends have very, very diverse opinions on what spectral distributions they like/hate, but they lack the language and experience to identify or communicate their preferences except for "Ooh I like/hate this bulb".I mostly use LED bulbs to keep heat generation down (I pay for the heat twice in Houston: once to generate it and again for the A/C to negate it). But I always mix in a bit of incandescents / halogens (2400-3000K) which provide full-spectrum blackbody radiation to see ALL the wonderful colors in my world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497394</guid></item><item><title>16.

Instead just write a few bullet points about what it actually does.However, I am very happy somebody finally put the prompt on TOP of a terminal window, since years I am wondering why people like to bow their head to the bottom of the screen.I guess it is the expected gesture for IT devs and admins nowadays to follow and bow your head, so this is a great help for people to understand what is the right posture in life!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like it's getting harder to tell what dagger is _actually_ for these days.At first we'd hoped it could replace jenkins - it provided an alternative way to run and debug CI pipelines - right on your machine! You could write in golang and just import what you needed. The dev direction feels more scattered now, trying to replace docker, be a new shell(?), and weirdly trying to be some kind of langchain?  Doing something different doesn't imply better. A new set of complicated CLI args is no better than what we started with (shell scripts, or jenkinsfiles to integrate docker builds). I'm a little bummed that the project has seemingly drifted (in my view) from the original mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool, I often find myself composing together a mixture of Dockerfiles and shell scripts for various images (build X Dockerfile for Y arch, save it as a base, build Z Dockerfile on top of the last thing, with W args). And then having to run it different ways with different mounts, based on if you're on a developer machine/robot/CI, running as a service/adhoc/attaching. This _looks_ like it could solve some of that messiness. I like that it can just reference the output of a build without having to muck around with tags (which are system global and can collide if you're not careful).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486881</guid></item><item><title>17.

I'm a big fan, but she mostly just listens when it's my turn to control the radio. Over the course of the concert, she kept shooting me these surprised and baffled looks. I asked her what was up with that afterwards."I thought those were weird songs you made up to sing to the cat! Who writes a song called Dr Worm?"I can't imagine how surreal it must be to see a band play your spouse's silly cat songs in front of hundreds of cheering fans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in kindergarten or very early elementary school (maybe 1991/1992) there was an episode of Tiny Toon Adventures with animated music videos for Particle Man and Istanbul. It still lives in my head today.I didn’t even know they were a real band until I was older and knew I recognized those songs from somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns): A Movie About They Might Be Giants is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LaAgpV5UAM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43490173</guid></item><item><title>18.

My previous language, Valence (https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/Valence), dealt with semantic ambiguity — this one with calligraphy. It avoids an overly logical syntax in favor of compactness and expressiveness.I’m completing a book of these esolangs for MIT Press this fall including this; not much info yet online yet but here’s the link: https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262553087/forty-four-esolangs/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this what it feels like to learn to program as an adult? I can brainfuck and APL with the best of them, and this is the most alien language specification I’ve ever read&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would like to know how to even begin building an intuition for writing something in this. I read the entire README and the only thing I understand is glyph start and end ╵ ╷.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43492652</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its just people. People are the same everywhere, and are fundamentally unpredictable systems. How large groups behave does depends to a certain extent on context: by compared to others and your socio-economic situation. How they publicly expressed their values are entirely different from their behavior. This is to the dread of incumbent governments and pollsters.If you starve a wealthy man for 2 weeks he will be ready to cannibalize. If you create a metric upon which you place a lot of economic-value, soooner or later it will get gamed and corrupted. If you remove checks and balances humans being unpredictable will turn on each other.One can choose to ignore this fact, but at the cost of endless grief to oneself and those around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the third world, corruption is very open from the clerk in a local revenue office to the top ministers/secretaries. There is a price for every service.In the West, it is hard to see low-level corruption (bribes for services) in offices. However, corruption takes form in the shape of collusion; and this collusion is pretty much legal. Revolving door, consultants, lobbyists, conflicts of interests, setting up NGOs to grab money from the govt, offering sinecure jobs like advisors, directors, etc for friends and family--these are some strategies to do unethical yet legal stuff in the West.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm fully aware that Sweden and Denmark are different countries (I lived in Denmark for 3 years), but this reminded me of the reel of Swedes playing every time I visit IKEA, where they talk about how corruption is absolutely unthinkable in Swedish society.And there's also this tidbit from the article:&gt; Other Scandinavian nations also reeled upon watching The Black Swan. After the series premiered in Sweden, a criminologist at Lund University warned: “There’s a lot of evidence that it’s probably even worse here.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493159</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Take Oncall and Shove It" discusses the challenges and frustrations associated with being on-call as a software engineer. It highlights the impact on work-life balance, mental health, and job satisfaction, urging employers to reconsider the demands placed on engineers. The author shares personal experiences and suggests that on-call duty should be restructured to support both employees' well-being and company productivity, advocating for better communication and more balanced workloads. The piece ultimately calls for a reassessment of on-call practices in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What they don't tell you about working for yourself is the fact you can be effectively on-call 24x7 every day. I am currently supporting four wineries that are processing thousands of tonnes of receivals 24x7. It happens for two months of the year and I am expected to be available from 06:00 to 22:00 during that time, there is no phoning in sick or having a lazy day, I work alone and only have one reputation. I don't want to be that contractor forever known for destroying a clients business.You can only do this for so long though, when two or three problems come in simultaneously it can cause issues as you drop something halfway through when something more important comes in. I once executed an SQL update query without a where clause under this kind of pressure, and ended up working until the next morning to recover, only to start again at 6AM. I have even had land-line calls at 2AM to bypass my mobile restrictions. The rewards are great, but don't let anyone tell you it is always easy.My current system is 16 years old now and I know all the ins and outs so it has been pretty easy to keep on top of things the last several years, however I am glad the replacement system is nearly written and it will be somebody else problem in 2026.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For "non-exempt" employees, that's paid "stand-by time" California.[1] Also see this case involving on-call coroners.[2]The way this works in most unionized jobs is that there's a stand-by rate paid for on-call hours, plus a minimum number of hours at full or overtime pay, usually four, when someone is called to duty. This is useful to management - if the call frequency is too high, it becomes cheaper to hire an additional person.[1] https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/CallBackAndStandbyTime.pdf[2] https://casetext.com/case/berry-v-county-of-sonoma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent article. I can relate to a lot of it. The sad part is that we can't even control the quality of the systems we're oncall for. We're pushed by management for new features, not for robustness of the tools. Also some systems have no clear ownership, so nobody has an incentive to fix them. It'll be next oncall's business. Oncall is really the worst part of my job. I can stand long hours but this is something else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498213</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a German native speaker, it's surprisingly hard to read the code examples. Seems like all common concepts of programming languages like access modifiers, types etc. are hardwired to their English terms in my brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horrible idea, but I am not surprised someone decided to do this. In Germany employees have guarantee that they can speak German at work, does not matter the company is international, on the meetings, emails are people from USA, India, Ukraine, Poland. German has to be used if a single German employee wants that.I have a friend who works in such place. DeepL is a most important piece of software he uses, the problem starts if DeepL messes up some details. Meetings are a nightmare, communication is a nightmare. Managers try to mitigate all that, by avoiding employees from Germany in the projects, what is pretty funny, as company is multinational, but of German origin, and most of the managers are Germans...This attitude is just one of the many factors that led to https://www.amazon.pl/Kaput-German-Miracle-Wolfgang-Munchau/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm... if you are going to use only Bavarian paraphernalia to symbolize "German Rust", you might as well go all the way and use Bavarian instead of German for some extra laughs? Ok, TBF most programming keywords are rather scientific, and dialects are less used in academia, so that might be tricky.Also, I would bet that most Germans would also use "fn" as a two-letter shorthand for "Funktion". But it just had to be different, so they chose "fk" for "FunKtion"...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43488490</guid></item><item><title>28.

If I have a long command I know I run will frequently, I 'tag' them at the end by a shell comment[1].So for example, I have one that I use to run software updates:    softwareupdate --include-config-data --install --all --restart # system:update:restart

I have a similar one without the `--restart` option that I tag with `:norestart` instead, but you get the idea—I put related commands under a common term.Then I can just use the ctrl-r builtin keybinding, type `:system` and cycle through system related commands, or go exactly to the command I want. The beauty of this is that it also works in bash and systems I remote into (which I frequently need to do at work), without any extra plugins required.[1]: interactive comments are disabled by default in zsh, but can be enabled with `setopt interactive_comments`&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Atuin and like it a lot, and sync history across hosts.However, the fuzzy search in Atuin is worse than fzf, which was a downgrade. It just has less effective heuristics/scoring, e.g. it might find the individual letters of a short command scattered in a command that had a long base64 input or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have my own solution that I've been using for many years — I record all my bash history.Bash has a hook (cannot remember the name on my phone) that is called on every command.It's easy enough to write into a file the command together with the directory and git branch.Then I can grep it with a bash function that colors the dir and branch in the output.It does not replace ctrl-r but it's a great addition especially when running multiple sessions and bash saving just the last one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470206</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of embracing a mindset of abundance in housing policy and urban development. It argues that to effectively address the housing crisis and promote equitable living conditions, communities must shift from scarcity-based thinking to a focus on creating and maintaining abundant housing options. The piece emphasizes the need for policy changes, inclusive growth strategies, and a collaborative approach among stakeholders to foster an environment that enables the construction of more affordable and diverse housing. Ultimately, the message centers on the necessity of proactive efforts to manage and enhance urban living spaces to benefit all residents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've grown a little bit more skeptical of what can realistically be achieved by the passive nature of YIMBY-ism.In Portland, they passed some radical new zoning laws a few years ago that allowed anyone, anywhere the ability to zone ADUs on their property. And the cost to get permits is almost nothing.I have lots of friends and family in the area with property. But not a single one has added an ADU. It seems like it should be a no-brainer, so I'll bring up and ask why not? And there are basically two reasons:- There's a general fear of being a landlord. Tenants have a lot of legal rights, and the risk of inviting someone onto your property who could start squatting or doing drugs and not being able to evict them is beyond the pale for most families.- They don't need the money. If you can afford a home in the area, you're already pretty well off. Even though adding a rental could be pretty lucrative, there's just not enough motivation to go through with it.To me it has little to do with incumbent politicians and everything to do with the incumbent middle class. I'm all for removing red tape and restrictions, but we also need to come up with incentives to light a fire under the butts of individual actors in our economy to actually go out and make things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of getting tangled up in social issues, liberal politicians should be prioritizing housing, infrastructure and government services supporting people's economic activity of all kinds.Delivering better lives for people, and having the courage to stand up to vested interests, from house owners to corporations, would create a huge and lasting political win across a broad section of the electorate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author has it quite backwards, at least as it comes to housing.Politicians are beholden to the members of their district, not would-be members. Sure, more affordable housing would benefit many people, but it wouldn't benefit the members of the district, particularly the wealthy and powerful, since more affordable housing is very nearly equivalent to real estate values decreasing (at the very least, as perceived by voters). Sure, renters would in theory benefit, but real estate prices aren't rental rates, and the renters have to move to capture the improvement in pricing, often outside of the district.Essentially, the status quo of real estate pricing always increasing in a district serves everyone within the district well enough. Any change to that is a massive financial risk to property owners, so it will be vigorously opposed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495644</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of dynamic dispatch in Rust, a programming language known for its focus on performance and safety. It explains how dynamic dispatch allows for flexibility in method calls, enabling the selection of which method to invoke at runtime rather than compile time. The author discusses the underlying mechanisms of dynamic dispatch, including trait objects and the use of `Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt;`, providing examples and code snippets to illustrate how it works. Additionally, the article compares dynamic dispatch with static dispatch, emphasizing the trade-offs involved, such as performance implications and use cases for each approach. Overall, it serves as a tutorial for understanding and effectively using dynamic dispatch in Rust programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that this post is 8 years old, and some things have moved on since then.In particular, trait object upcasting is on beta now and will be promoted to stable in a couple of weeks.  I know that there has also been active development towards enabling multiple-bound trait objects, but I don't know what the status of that effort is.The article also makes the (quite understandable) mistake of conflating a fat pointer to a trait object with the trait object itself.  In Rust, trait objects are "unsized", which means they can only exist behind some kind of pointer.  And any pointer in Rust that targets an unsized type grows an additional metadata field (for trait objects, a vtable pointer).  This is a slightly weird behavior with a few unexpected consequences that often catches people off-guard, but understanding it is key to understanding why you can't make a trait object for something like `Clone`, which returns an instance of itself-- Because unsized types can't appear on their own, the return type of the `clone()` method would be invalid.For a more thorough take, I recommend "A tour of `dyn Trait`" ( https://quinedot.github.io/rust-learning/dyn-trait-overview.... )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to when Rust gets1. erased types (have to use behind pointer, so not shallow dynamic sizing)
2. Existential typesSo we can build vtables by hand.Type safe API to any OOP ABI + tons of stuff OOP people never imagined....let's go!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trait upcasting will land in Rust 1.86.0 which will be released in one week: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/134367&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43455698</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Glider, a flight simulation game designed for the Apple II computer, highlighting its features, gameplay mechanics, and nostalgic appeal. It provides an overview of the game’s objectives, controls, and unique aspects that set it apart from other games of its time.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's some wacky smooth animation for the Apple II.  It's quite a feat to have multiple apparent sprites move so smoothly like that.Apple II high resolution graphics are 280x192 pixels stored in 8 kilobytes at 2000 - 3fff or 4000 - 5fff.  (With a fun interleaving where bits in memory are not in the same order as the bits on the display.  Woz saved a few chips that way.)That is to say, there are no hardware sprites.The fastest way to clear the display is an unrolled loop in the form of LDA #0, STA $2000, STA $2001, STA $2002 etc.  That works out to about 30,000 cycles which takes 30 milliseconds.  A more plausible operation - displaying a whole-screen bitmap by copying it from another location in RAM to the framebuffer using a loop with indexes - weighs in at several hundred thousand cycles, or an appreciable fraction of a second.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. I'll have to get an emulator up and running to try it.Another wild one (back port?) was a small run a guy did for the Nintendo. Here's one on eBay for example: https://www.ebay.com/itm/186125162930&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone wanting to build sprite type code on the Apple II, you really should read this article in Byte magazine:Preshift-Table Graphics on your Apple
by Bill Budge, with Gregg Williams and Rob Moore. A23
Move blocks of pixels across the screen with only 3K bytes of overheadIt's kind of hard to find, it's in the December 1984 Byte magazine, but an additional magazine at the end of the PDF, Bytes Guide to Apple.At the time this was huge, Bill Budge was probably the most well known game programmer, so getting a look inside how he wrote code was a big thing.Of course, as mentioned elsewhere, graphics is hard on the Apple II because of the complex memory layout due to Woz wanting to save a few chips. This can be contrasted with the Atari and Commodore computers that had custom chips that made graphics a lot easier.https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1984-12/page/n397/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43491977</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the philosophy of coroutines, a programming concept that allows functions to pause execution and resume later, enabling cooperative multitasking. It discusses the historical context and evolution of coroutines, compares them with traditional threading models, and highlights their advantages, such as simpler code and improved readability. The author reflects on the implications of using coroutines in software design, emphasizing the need for a clear understanding of control flow and state management. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a thoughtful approach to leveraging coroutines in programming to enhance efficiency and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I share the author's enthusiasm for coroutines. They're nice abstractions for all sorts of state-machine-like code and for concurrency (without parallelism).&gt; You could allocate a piece of memory for a coroutine stack; let the coroutines on it push and pop stack frames like ordinary function calls; and have a special ‘yield’ function that swaps out the stack pointer and switches over to executing on another stack. In fact, that’s not a bad way to add coroutines to a language that doesn’t already have them, because it doesn’t need the compiler to have any special knowledge of what’s going on. You could add coroutines to C in this way if you wanted to, and the approach would have several advantages over my preprocessor system.In C minicoro is a nice library that provides just that: https://github.com/edubart/minicoroIn Zig there's zigcoro: https://github.com/rsepassi/zigcoroAnother source I found enlightening on coroutines is "Coroutines in Lua": https://www.lua.org/doc/jucs04.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been fascinated by coroutine code for ages – this was a great read.For one of the best work projects I’ve done, I used Redux-Saga. It was so elegant for a heavily live-updating ui app. Using coroutines for making API requests, watching sockets, sending and receiving updates, and reacting to data conflicts felt so natural and all just came together so beautifully.The term he uses for “turning functions inside out” is spot on for how they feel. In particular, the way a good coroutine only focuses on the pure state, while being independent of side effects and even time itself really expanded my view of code. It made testing and reasoning about logic so much easier too. It’s a model I really wish was more widespread in languages and the industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently updated: [Simon Tatham, initial version 2023-09-01, last updated 2025-03-25]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495785</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe something worth exploring, run it like an inverted generational garbage collector.Separate the problematic domains and run them in a lower priority background crawl; then do the opposite as well, have a higher priority list for crawling sites that have regular updates more often, based on their last update gap.Basically like a generational garbage collector but in this case it's generational content collector, although arguably, still mostly garbage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you running into those autogen crawler labyrinths that have been posted about recently? Certainly the .edu and .gov ones are probably just huge sites.Am I correct in assuming you are recrawling your entire corpus to get fresh results? Would there be a downside to replacing crawl epochs with a continuous crawl that is random but with age priority?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493207</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because copper is no longer a good enough conductor when it it is used in very thin layers, the latest and densest CMOS fabrication processes have begun to replace copper with other metals for the first 2 metal layers, which are the thinnest.It is not known with certainty what metals are currently used by Intel or TSMC, though cobalt and ruthenium have been considered as the most promising choices.There has been a lot of speculation about whether the choice of cobalt for the thinnest metal layers has been an important cause of Intel's woes with their "10 nm" CMOS fabrication process.While there were chances for this hypothesis to be true, the actual reasons for Intel's failure to achieve the predicted clock frequencies and fabrication yields with their "10 nm" processes remain unknown, because Intel has never published any information about this.Whichever was the reason, eventually Intel has succeeded to fix this fabrication process, even if only around 5 years later than in their initial plan, after rebranding it in "Intel 7", at least from the point of view of the achievable performances, which have culminated in Raptor Lake Refresh, though perhaps Intel's incapacity of predicting accurately the reliability behavior as a function of the supply voltage, as demonstrated in many failures of Raptor Lake/Alder Lake CPUs, may indicate that they have never succeeded to understand the exact characteristics of this fabrication process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Correct title is "New Films Conduct Better the Thinner They Get"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The research described was done at Stanford by Profs Eric Pop and Krishna Saraswat.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Postel's Law, which expresses the principle that systems should be liberal in what they accept but conservative in what they send. It examines the implications of this law in the context of software development and internet protocols, arguing that while being lenient with inputs from users can foster flexibility and compatibility, it can also lead to complexity and unforeseen vulnerabilities. The author uses the analogy of a "three-ring circus" to illustrate the chaotic nature of managing diverse systems and the importance of balancing acceptance with rigor in programming practices.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a counterpoint, Postel's Law as implemented in other domains has been spectacularly successful.One classic example is in transistor networks: each node in a network (think interconnected logic gates, but at the analog level) accepts a wider range of voltages as "high" and "low (i.e., 1- and 0-valued) than they are specified to output. In 5V logic, for example, transistors might output 5V and 0V to within 5%, but accept anything above 1.2V as "high" and below that as "low". (Sometimes called the "static discipline" and used as an example of the "robustness principle"—the other name for Postel's Law.)This is critical in these networks, but not because transistor manufacturers don't read or fully implement the spec: it's because there is invariably unavoidable noise introduced into the system, and one way to handle that is for every node to "clean up" its input to the degree that it can.It's one thing to rely on this type of clean-up to make your systems work in the face of external noise. But when you start rearchitecting your systems to operate close to this boundary—that is, you're no longer trying to meet spec, because you know some other node will clean up your mess for you—you're cooked. Because the invariable noise will now push you outside the range of what your spec's liberal input regime can tolerate, and you'll get errors.The problem isn't Postel's law. It's adverse selection / moral hazard / whatever you want to call the incentive to exploit a system's tolerance for error to improve short-term outcomes for the exploiter but at long-term cost to system stability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's a related phenomenon that we see all the time in automotive circles. A vehicle manufacturer (OEM) needs a new thing, so a supplier develops it in cooperation with them. Great! The requirements were vague and all that, but you arrive at a solution that works. The supplier documents the performance in a product specification stating what it can do and under what conditions. Great! Next the OEM asks for quotes on next gen, and also goes to other suppliers to see if they can provide at lower cost. The OEM uses your product spec as a requirements document and this is where it all goes to shit (a product specification is not a requirements document). They no longer know what they need, but the know what they have and they want "same or better" next time. Over time this can lead to absurd specs and increased complexity to meet them. Sometimes a competitor comes in with a cheaper version and the OEM gets excited based on price and all the actual requirements might get revisited because the cheaper part is out of spec (to save cost).This seems similar to the Postel's Law thing. If you produce to spec but accept things out of spec, the ecosystem will unofficially change the spec to what's actually out there. Then people will re-apply Postel's Law with a wider spec on what you produce and even wider on what you accept. Eventually you end up with a complex mess, but in this case it's a widening spec where in the automotive example it's usually a narrowing spec.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I encourage maintainers to reject user feedback that is much more properly directed to some commercial software vendor who has not implemented the specification correctly.Words to live by.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43487128</guid></item><item><title>40.

Higher quality triple pane windows exist, and they are a luxury for most homeowners. It’s great technology, but relatively few people build or upgrade their house with the long term consequences in mind for these things. There’s a reason you get a positive ROI when you fix up a kitchen or bathroom versus replacing windows which is typically viewed as maintenance. There needs to be incentives for these upgrades to be adopted by home builders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a company called LuxWall that is producing vacuum insulated windows that act basically like a thermos. There is a tiny space between the two panes that is pulled down to a high vacuum that results in a window that only transfers heat via radiation. Conductive and convective heat transfer are essentially eliminated. This results in a window with a R value similar to a fully insulated wall. Because the full unit is so thin, they are able to replace single pane windows in old buildings and drastically cut buildings energy consumption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43456936</guid></item><item><title>41.

Or at least tells them not to use airpods as their mic? Certainly there times when an interview is set up quickly.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a California bill aimed at phasing out ultra-processed foods in schools as part of an initiative to improve children's health and nutrition. It emphasizes the detrimental effects of these foods on students, including their contributions to obesity and related health issues. The bill seeks to replace unhealthy options with fresher, whole foods in school meals, aligning with broader public health goals. The proposed changes have garnered support from nutrition advocates and aim to foster healthier eating habits among school-aged children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the intent but the devil dwells in the details.  I keep up with the latest nutritional gurus in the US and UK and even staunch advocates of abstaining from Ultra Processed Food (UPF) self-admit to having a very hard time defining exactly what that means.  In addition, there are not a wealth of studies to support the harm of UPF - its mostly, avoid till more is known and educated supposition.  This frustrates attempt to be precise about what's in and what's out.Secondly, why push the deadline out to 2032.  Start banning the clear junk next week.  Ok, maybe it takes a while to hammer out a definition that works but start with simple rules - ratio of dietary fiber to total carbs &lt;= 5; at least one fresh veggie and one fresh fruit per meal (fresh = not the canned in syrup stuff).  CA produces a significant portion of US produce so should be somewhat easy for them.  Not so much for Minnesota but baby steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm grateful that this bill is taking a much more measured approach than the headline suggests. The bill is targeting specific additives, or "excessive" amounts of added sugar, salt, or fat (exact thresholds unnamed)."Ultra-processed" gets thrown about as a big food quality bogeyman, but some definitions of the label are as broad as "contains any amount of added sugar". I'm glad California isn't following a standard that extreme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Vietnam, where freshly cooked meals were a daily staple. Getting them was effortless—just a few steps from home.Coming to the U.S., however, turned this into a major challenge, especially while raising my own kids. Ultra-processed food is everywhere, and preparing fresh meals takes significant time, even though I’ve become quite efficient (a typical meal takes 30–60 minutes).While this doesn’t fully solve our food challenges for kids, it’s a step in the right direction for the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495997</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issue of unwanted attribute changes in Terraform providers and how to effectively handle them. It highlights the importance of managing and ignoring specific changes to prevent disruptions in infrastructure as code. The author provides practical solutions, including the use of the `ignore_changes` argument in resource definitions, to allow users to maintain stability in their Terraform configurations while still being able to update other attributes without unwanted side effects. Throughout, the post emphasizes best practices for managing Terraform provider behavior to avoid potential conflicts or errors in deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never used this provider, and while I do think you're right that the provider probably shouldn't change the attribute on you, the docs for the `docker_container` resource[1] suggest populating the `image` argument with the `image_id` attribute of a `docker_image` resource[2].This should give you a location to stick in the friendly name of a container that won't get clobbered by the provider.I do like the explanation you provided though, because this is the kind of puzzle you can't really solve with Terraform until you've run into it. I've never used the `replace_triggered_by` feature.[1]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/l...[2]: I was originally expecting `docker_image` to be a data source, but the resource seems to be the recommended method for this, and I didn't wrap my brain around the differences between the data source and the resource before writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As tags aren't necessarily immutable, it's probably advisable to use the full hash in most situations anyway.This is a useful trick in situations where the image changing under your feet isn't very important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;null_resource is being deprecated in favor of terraform_data:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources...~8 years in or so with terraform and I've found null_resource to be a useful crutch in doing things like, "take this source and compile it with this script that'll basically never change, then put it somewhere that's defined in terraform." Overly relying on this mechanism feels like terraform code smell to me, just from my personal experience, if that's even a thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43454642</guid></item><item><title>46.

It just has so many little annoyances like the controller seems to discharge itself between uses every time,  an Android interface that almost makes sense, etc.  It sits next to a used Blu-Ray player so I can play discs.I am thinking about replacing it with a used PS4 or maybe a PS5 so I can get a great Plex client that also plays discs,  the used PS4 costs less than a new Shield -- even though I'm disinvesting from Xbox in favor of steam I'm sure there are still some PS4 exclusive games I'd like to play,  though it is late enough in the lifecycle that the PS5 doesn't seem crazy to me and it would be future proof in terms of supporting a future high-end TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So how bright do we want/need our displays to be?

Two decades ago, high-school- and college-age males (ages 15 to 24) spent about a quarter of an hour a day alone playing games. Now, that figure has more than quintupled to 1.4 hours a day.Wat? I'd have expected it to be a lot more.I'm sure there are quite a few who spend over eight hours a day playing games...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing jumped out: many of the states with high rates of "always" lonely, also have high rates of "never" lonely. Many of these states are in the Sun Belt. The article ties those always rates to poverty, these are also states that have had a high in-migration in recent years.Could this contradiction instead be that many of those who report being always lonely are those who have moved recently to the states, and who don't have the connection (often familial) that those who have been around longer, or who have stayed back in the "less lonely" states, have?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I misread some of the article, but seems like younger people just "suck" at being alone?  IE, older people are less likely to feel lonely when they're physically alone?  I wonder if that's because older people are more likely to have a solo hobby - reading a book, knitting, whatever - and younger people are more likely to "doom scroll" online?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470911</guid></item><item><title>50.

The UK has a fairly established national ANPR system, and it generates on the order of 90M records per day [1]. All of this data is available to various law enforcement agencies. If you drive, you're probably being recorded in a way accessible to the PNC every day.Because of how effective this is for catching even fairly minor violations like failure to pay vehicle tax, number plate cloning is becoming pretty common (comparatively) in the UK. This means that you can easily get swept up in a police dragnet because someone has stolen your car's identity.[1] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-anpr-ser...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the genie is out of the bottle, when it comes to ALPRs in the United States, I'd rather just have all the data publicly available. If the cops, data brokers, and insurance companies can see it I should be able to as well.I should be able to see the comings and goings of law enforcement, elected officials, etc, if they can see mine.Alternatively, lock it away behind judicial oversight. Make the cops get a warrant. Criminalize companies collecting the data from offering it in any manner other than by the order of a judge.I feel the same way about tracking cell phones, publicly-owned surveillance cameras, privately-owned surveillance cameras that are "voluntarily" offered to law enforcement, and, in general, any dragnet surveillance available to law enforcement. If it's available to law enforcement and not being conducted on an individual basis under a judicial order (or, heck, even just probable cause) I think it should be available to the public, too."But stalkers!"Tough. That's the price we have to pay for keeping law enforcement in check. Either adapt or take this power away from law enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think there should be an expectation of anonymity for the specific case of operating a car on a public road. It's a lot of responsibility, so you should be scrutinized when you do it.That's part of my grievances against the urbanism of the U.S.A. When the only viable option to get around is cars, there is no privacy.It's important to advocate for public places to be livable for everyone, not just drivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504413</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses thirteen key insights and lessons learned that the author wishes they had known earlier in their life. It covers various themes such as personal growth, the importance of resilience, the value of relationships, and the significance of pursuing one’s passions. The author emphasizes the need for self-acceptance, embracing change, and learning from failures, urging readers to reflect on their own experiences and to adopt a positive mindset in navigating life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm generally in the "never trust the autorouter" camp (and by extension "never trust the bevy of AI tools entering the space"), but it's undeniable there are some big opportunities in the eCAD space to speed up some aspects of layout. I'm probably more likely to use co-creation tools, rather than full auto tools, simply because I rely heavily on iteration. Many times when starting a design my placements aren't set and that has a huge impact on routing. I didn't see on your page whether placement was part of your algorithm. I already rely on tools like push and shove and occasionally auto complete.I'm always curious about people entering the space though. It is a small market, IMO. The tools are fractured, the existing players are lumbering behemoths, and the users are cranky zealots (you will have to pry KiCad out of my cold dead hands). I noted the step about the AR being written in JavaScript, which I have no real opinion on, but I'm curious about plans to plug into ecosystems (CAD vendors, OS tools) or try and draw people into another new ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Point 8, the fast dismissal of Monte-Carlo method is a huge blunder.The point of Monte-Carlo method is that you can tradeoff accuracy for speed. The longer you run your algorithm the more accurate you get.But what's even more interesting is that we can often use the contrapositive : You can get shitty accurate result real fast.Instead of exploring all paths, you explore only one path picked at random.And that's where it shines : when you put it into the most imbricated loop of your algorithm.For example when you want to learn a neural network which autoroute. Typically you would have the outerloop which is updating the neural network parameter, and the inner-loop which is computing a path through the graph.When you use Monte-Carlo this inner-loop which control accuracy can be reduced to 1 iteration if everything is bias-less, you will have a slower outerloop due to higher variance but the machine learning should """theoretically""" learn.This is what allows you to build policies which intuitively always pick the right decision. Like in chess or go, you have some monte-carlo tree search variant like alpha-go-zero or alpha-chess-zero or alpha-router-zero, where even without the search part, the giant cache (encoded by the neural network parameters), once trained, can compute your best guess path in one pass through your neural network aka constant time (with a constant which can easily trade memory for speed by augmenting the number of parameters or training for longer).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a great discussion of autorouting. Then he ends with: "key piece to enable the “vibe-building” of electronics." OuchRouting itself is easy. It's when the router has to tear up stuff it already routed to fit new stuff in that things get complicated and the combinatorics start to get you.I miss the autorouter KiCAD used to have. It was taken out for iffy IP reasons (the author had worked for an autorouting company). Reaction to users who wanted it back were along the lines of "Real Men Don't Use Autorouters".[1][1] https://forum.kicad.info/t/autorouting-and-autoplacement/185...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499992</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get so confused on this. I play around, test, and mess with LLMs all the time and they are miraculous. Just amazing, doing things we dreamed about for decades. I mean, I can ask for obscure things with subtle nuance where I misspell words and mess up my question and it figures it out. It talks to me like a person. It generates really cool images. It helps me write code. And just tons of other stuff that astounds me.And people just sit around, unimpressed, and complain that ... what ... it isn't a perfect superintelligence that understands everything perfectly?  This is the most amazing technology I've experienced as a 50+ year old nerd that has been sitting deep in tech for basically my whole life. This is the stuff of science fiction, and while there totally are limitations, the speed at which it is progressing is insane. And people are like, "Wah, it can't write code like a Senior engineer with 20 years of experience!"Crazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience (almost exclusively Claude), has just been so different that I don't know what to say. Some of the examples are the kinds of things I explicitly wouldn't expect LLMs to be particularly good at so I wouldn't use them for, and others, she says that it just doesn't work for her, and that experience is just so different than mine that I don't know how to respond.I think that there are two kinds of people who use AI: people who are looking for the ways in which AIs fail (of which there are still many) and people who are looking for the ways in which AIs succeed (of which there are also many).A lot of what I do is relatively simple one off scripting. Code that doesn't need to deal with edge cases, won't be widely deployed, and whose outputs are very quickly and easily verifiable.LLMs are almost perfect for this. It's generally faster than me looking up syntax/documentation, when it's wrong it's easy to tell and correct.Look for the ways that AI works, and it can be a powerful tool. Try and figure out where it still fails, and you will see nothing but hype and hot air. 
Not every use case is like this, but there are many.-edit- Also, when she says "none of my students has ever invented references that just don't exist"...all I can say is "press X to doubt"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I become more and more convinced with each of these tweets/blogs/threads that using LLMs well is a skill set akin to using Search well.It’s been a common mantra - at least in my bubble of technologists - that a good majority of the software engineering skill set is knowing how to search well. Knowing when search is the right tool, how to format a query, how to peruse the results and find the useful ones, what results indicate a bad query you should adjust… these all sort of become second nature the longer you’ve been using Search, but I also have noticed them as an obvious difference between people that are tech-adept vs not.LLMs seems to have a very similar usability pattern. They’re not always the right tool, and are crippled by bad prompting. Even with good prompting, you need to know how to notice good results vs bad, how to cherry-pick and refine the useful bits, and have a sense for when to start over with a fresh prompt. And none of this is really _hard_ - just like Search, none of us need to go take a course on prompting - IMO folks jusr need to engage with LLMs as a non-perfect tool they are learning how to wield.The fact that we have to learn a tool doesn’t make it a bad one. The fact that a tool doesn’t always get it 100% on the first try doesn’t make it useless. I strip a lot of screws with my screwdriver, but I don’t blame the screwdriver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498338</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, what a blast from the past. Around the year 2000 or 2001 I got an optical mouse as a present (either birthday or new year, can't remember). I really wanted it for a long time because playing StarCraft with a mechanical one was rather painful.Needless to say it was a USB mouse and I only had ps/2. I purchased an adapter but it never worked despite spending a lot of time trying and testing it with different PCs and mice.Then I took the adapter to an electronics repair shop. They opened it up and explained to me it was fake: it just connected the wires without any circuitry for the real USB support. They had no idea why anyone would manufacturer such a thing.Well, now I know why. I spent quite a long time thinking I was sold a counterfeit adapter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once had a very awkward conversation with a sales person in PC World.I had been given a old retired server from work to take home and learn with... only problem was it had no USB.I was asking for a PS2 keyboard, he said they don't sell them but I could use any USB keyboard, I told him I don't have any USB ports and I needed a PS2 keyboard.After awhile of him going back and forth with his manager, only to return to tell me i can use USB, It turned out he thought I was trying to buy a Play Station 2 keyboard and he'd never heard of PS/2!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some more details (and interesting historical perspective) can be found here: https://superuser.com/questions/704920/how-to-determine-if-u...Apparently around 2014 the vast majority of mouses and keyboards were dual-protocol, but in 2019 the first reports of them being USB-only started appearing. I suspect a lot of the cheapest mouse SoCs are still dual-protocol as they worked when first designed, and they just kept producing them without any changes.Pinout and explanation of how they detect protocol here: https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/28288/how...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499823</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on strategies for developers to write effective blog posts that engage readers. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the audience, using clear language, and structuring content well. Key tips include writing with a conversational tone, incorporating personal experiences, and being concise while providing value. The author also highlights the benefits of sharing knowledge through blogging, such as building a professional reputation and contributing to the community. Overall, the piece serves as a guide to help developers create impactful written content that resonates with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My general takes (as someone who also has a somewhat popular blog) is thatThe inverted pyramid is almost always the correct format for your text.  I often put the tweet-length version of the post in the title or first paragraph.  Get to the point quickly, then elaborate.  Means you can bail out at any point of the text and still take home most of what mattered, while the meticulous crowd can have their nitpicks addressed toward the end.The problem of finding an audience is best solved by being really transparent about what you're about.  Inverted pyramid solves that.  There's no point to drawing in people who aren't going to be interested.  Retaining existing readers beats capturing new readers.I'm less bullish on images, unless they are profoundly relevant to the text.  Illustrations for the sake of having illustrations are no bueno in my opinion.  You want to reduce distractions and visual noise.  Images should above all never be funny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counterpoint: writing blog posts so that they are read by someone else completely defeats the point of writing for 99% of people. I do not mean to say that this the advice in the post is bad advice, just that if you focus on being read (i.e., checking rankings on HN, only writing articles that don't exist yet) you probably just will just stop writing at one point, because most of the stuff on the web just isn't read, and writing just to be read is probably not very motivating.Writing, even if no one reads what you write, is super valuable, and fun! Writing something down is to structure your own thoughts so that you learn more about the topic and about yourself. In my experience, publishing a piece of your writing just ensures that you double check your thinking, but most of the benefit is learning more about what you intend to write about.So here's my advice: just write posts on what you think is interesting on your personal blog. Don't install analytics, just write it down, publish it, and put it on your LinkedIn. Someone will see it someday and will like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reckon if you wanted to choose just a single rule it should be, "Write something that you yourself would actually read." The problem is that our brains are designed to sort of lie to us and tell us that what we've created is amazing when in fact we'd never actually read it if someone else had written it. If you can find a way to be objective and see your own writing as the far-from-perfect mess it actually is.(In principle, you could use "write something that someone else would actually read", but I think this is much harder, because it's much harder to know how other people would react! If you yourself would read it, well, we aren't that unique, lots of other people would read it too.)Also, props for this stark picture of reality: https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/write-blog-posts-dev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503872</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A recently discovered giant fungus-like organism, found in a forest in Oregon, may represent an entirely new branch of life, distinct from known fungi, plants, or animals. Researchers are studying its unique characteristics and genetic makeup, revealing its potential evolutionary significance. This organism could challenge existing classifications in biology and enhance our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Its fossils contained plantlike lignin instead of funguslike chitin or chitosan.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.14.643340v1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototaxites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Upon examining the internal structure of the fossilized Prototaxites, the researchers found that its interior was made up of a series of tubesWho knew the internet evolved millions of years ago?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with eukarya containing all multicellular organisms within the four kingdoms of fungi, animals, plants and protists.This bugs me so much. The four-kingdom system should have died out decades ago, it's absurdly wrong. For one thing, fungi and animals should be together (opisthokonts) if you're dividing eukaryotes into the major groups. If you consider genetics, there's no such thing as "protists", they're just a whole bunch of small things that were grouped together because we didn't know otherwise.It's more like, Archaeplastida, Excavata, SAR supergroup, Amoebozoa, and Opisthokonta at the moment. The exact list is up for debate, and currently undergoing change. There's plenty of weird things like Hemimastigophora and we're not really sure where they fit yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499342</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great to see that somebody else creates a true open source XSLT 3 and XPATH 3 implementation!I worked on projects which refused to use anything more modern than XSLT &amp; XPATH 1.0 because of lack of support in the non Java/Net World (1.0 = tech from 1999). Kudos to Saxon though, it was and is great but I wished there were more implementations of XSLT 2.0 &amp; XPATH 2.0 and beyond in the open source World... both are so much more fun and easier to use in 2.0+ versions.
For that reason I've never touched XSLT 3.0 (because I stuck to Saxon B 9.1 from 2009). I have no doubt it's a great spec  but there should be other ways than only Saxon HE to run it in an open source way.It's like we have an amazing modern spec but only one browser engine to run it ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many humongous XML sources. E.g. the Wikipedia archive is 42GB of uncompressed text. Holding a fully parsed representation of it in memory would take even more, perhaps even &gt;100GB which immediately puts this size of document out of reach.The obvious solution is streaming, but streaming appears to not be supported, though is listed under Challenging Future Ideas: https://github.com/Paligo/xee/blob/main/ideas.mdHow hard is it to implement XML/XSLT/XPATH streaming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This, thirty years later, is the best pitch for XML I’ve read. Essentially, it’s a slow moving, standards-based approach to data interoperability.I hated it the minute I learned about it, because it missed something I knew I cared about, but didn’t have a word for in the 90s - developer ergonomics. XML sucks shit for someone who wants to think tersely and code by hand. Seriously, I hate it with a fiery passion.Happily to my mind the economics of easier-for-creators -&gt; make web browsers and rendering engines either just DEAL with weird HTML, or else force people to use terse data specs like JSON won out. And we have a better and more interesting internet because of it.However, I’m old enough now to appreciate there is a place for very long-standing standards in the data and data transformation space, and if the XML folks want to pick up that banner, I’m for it. I guess another way to say it is that XML has always seemed to be a data standard which is intended to be what computers prefer, not people. I’m old enough to welcome both, finally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43502291</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The preface of "Cosmic Python" sets the stage for a practical exploration of Python programming through the lens of functional and object-oriented design. It emphasizes the importance of building maintainable and scalable applications, and introduces core concepts that will be covered in the book, such as the evolution of Python and its various paradigms. The authors aim to guide readers in understanding and applying these principles to develop robust software solutions. The preface serves as an invitation for both novice and experienced developers to enhance their skills in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43501989"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow this book is a goldmine for architecture patterns. I love how easy it is to get into a topic and quickly grasp it.Having said that, from a practical and experience standpoint, using some of these patterns can really spiral out into an increased complexity and performance issues in Python, specially when you use already opinionated frameworks like Django which already uses the ActiveRecord pattern.I’ve been in companies big and small using Python, both using and ignoring architectural patterns. Turns out all the big ones with strict architectural (n=3) pattern usage, although “clean”, the code is waaaay to complex and unnecessarily slow in tasks that at first glance should had been simple.Whereas the big companies that didn’t care for these although the code was REALLY ugly in some places (huge if-else files/functions, huge Django models with all business logic implemented in them), I was most productive because although the code was ugly I could read it, understand it, and modify the 1000 lines of if-else statements.Maybe this says something about me more than the code but I hate to admit I was more productive in the non clean code companies. And don’t get me started on the huge amount of discussions they avoided on what’s clean or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some parts of this book are extremely useful, especially when it's talking about concepts that are more general than Python or any other specific language -- such as event-driven architecture, commands, CQRS etc.That being said, I have a number issues with other parts of it, and I have seen how dangerous it can be when inexperienced developers take it as a gospel and try to implement everything at once (which is a common problem with any collection of design patterns like this.For example, repository is a helpful pattern in general; but in many cases, including the examples in the book itself, it is a huge overkill that adds complexity with very little benefit. Even more so as they're using SQLAlchemy, which is a "repository" in its own right (or, more precisely, a relational database abstraction layer with an ORM added on top).Similarly, service layers and unit of work are useful when you have complex applications that cover multiple complex use cases; but in a system consisting of small services with narrow responsibilities they quickly become overly bloated using this pattern. And don't even get me started with dependency injection in Python.The essential thing about design patterns is that they're tools like any other, and the developers should understand when to use them, and even more importantly when not to use them. This book has some advice in that direction, but in my opinion it should be more prominent and placed upfront rather at the end of each chapter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a Typescript dev but this book is one of my favorite architecture books, I reference it all the time. My favorite pattern is the fake unit of work/service patterns for testing, I use this religiously in all my projects for faking (not mocking!!) third party services. It also helped me with dilemmas around naming, eg it recommends naming events in a very domain specific way rather than infrastructure or pattern specific way (eg CART_ITEM_BECAME_UNAVAILABLE is better than USER_NOTIFICATION). Some of these things are obvious but tedious to explain to teammates, so the fact that cosmic python is fully online makes it really easy to link to. Overall, a fantastic and formative resource for me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43501989</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the transformation of Kerala, a state in India, from poverty to prosperity, highlighting several key factors that contributed to this change. It discusses the role of strong governmental policies, effective land reform, investments in education and healthcare, and the promotion of social welfare, which have collectively enhanced the quality of life for its residents. Additionally, it examines how Kerala's unique political landscape and emphasis on social equity have fostered economic stability and growth, making it a noteworthy example among India's states. The analysis emphasizes the importance of these strategies in achieving sustainable development and improving the overall well-being of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in the US but my parents are from Kerala and I still have family there that I visit.One thing I found interesting was the pride in literacy and education. Kerala has a 96% literacy rate which is the highest in India [1].It's one of my favorite places to visit. Unlike other parts of India such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Hyderbad -- it's tropical and lush with much less pollution than what you might see in those other parts of India.My parents have a home in a rural community which hasn't changed much in the past few decades compared to somewhere like Bengaluru. It's quiet and slow with a high important on family relationships. No doubt it's westernizing, albeit slower than other parts of India - but for now it still holds much of the charm I've known since I was a kid.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_India&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in the second southernmost district of Kerala, Quilon (now Kollam). I am now a U.S. citizen in the Bay Area. Growing up in Quilon, I attended an Anglo-Indian boy's school called Infant Jesus - in a small strip of land called Thangassery, people predominantly spoke English. I was taught British dialects emphasizing pronunciations that mimicked the world stage. I didn't really understand it until much later in life.In my 20s, the contrast hit when I traveled across other parts of India.Kerala has a mix of Western population that decided to stay back after the Indian Independence that brought with them Christianity, education, hospitals, and the Catholic culture. Kerala is also one of the few places in India where you can eat beef without inhibitions.The writer hasn't emphasized this enough, but when oil struck the Middle East in the 1960s, the massive influx of blue and white-collar labor (who had the English language and engineering skills) that helped set up what's now Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Oman, and many other countries was built by Malayalees. My father-in-law was one of the earlier engineers at Aramco in Saudi. The Middle Eastern money has flown back to Kerala thanks to high bank interest rates (nearly 10%) and landlocked real estate that helped raise the state's GDP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kerala has extremely aggressive out-migration (including my entire family): it is a bad place to be ambitious, particularly with the France-like union culture. If India is to become China-rich or Mexico-rich, my prediction is Kerala will regress to the mean of India states. Its model seems geared towards being an extremely good place to be poor (which is a huge achievement to be clear: they dealt with COVID better than the US, universal literacy is amazing etc) but not towards getting richer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43507286</guid></item><item><title>11.

Well, you put him in a swimming pool that is full of molasses, and then you forbid him to move any part of his body  faster than 1 cm/min.  Now imagine yourself in that condition: you're under the swimming pool in molasses, and now you can only move like the hands of a clock.  If under these ground rules you are able to move a few meters in a couple of weeks, you may qualify as a low Reynolds number swimmer.[0][0]https://cooperlab.wustl.edu/PracticalAdvice/Purcell%201977.p...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zombie physiology also seems a stretch—-how do organisms with so many open and often bleeding dirt-covered wounds maintain hemodynamic stability in the face of inevitable septic shock and/or blood loss? A movie where a virus just makes infected people seem normal and very friendly but want to furtively bite other people to spread disease and then have delayed onset terminal sickness, like a subtle version of rabies, would be terrifying and more plausible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505334</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;milliForth-6502 is a compact implementation of the Forth programming language designed for the 6502 microprocessor. The project aims to provide a lightweight and efficient environment for developing applications on 8-bit systems, with a focus on minimal resource usage. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and examples to help users get started with Forth programming on the 6502 architecture, making it a valuable resource for enthusiasts and retro computing hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always get the impression that people spend more time writing Forth interpreters, rather than writing Forth programs to solve actual problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what I miss about the Red Power mod for Minecraft.  I wonder if GregTech would see the fun in adding some sort of CPU that wouldn't be the worst emulation stacked inside of hand written 'machine' op functions...Offhand, anyone know of any good (either long stable, or better, well maintained and likely to persist) CPU emulators for Java?  Something that does 'web assembly' might fit the task if it's reasonable to transpile a fake binary format into real WASM.The first good search result I got was : https://github.com/dylibso/chicory : better than wasmer-java for this use case since it doesn't depend on native binaries.Relating this back to the topic.  It would be interesting to have to, at least copy in someone else's if not, write your own Forth interpreter to help bootstrap computers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heh - I was looking for examples of 6502 Forth. I did fine fig-forth, but this looks interesting too now. This always happens on hacker news - I have some interest, and I see it on the front page of Hacker News soon after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503897</guid></item><item><title>13. xAI has acquired X, xAI now valued at $80B</title><link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1905731750275510312</link><description>

When you do a deal with yourself you can assign any value you want to assets, it isn’t a competitive process.  In the previous case Solar City was dying but its acquisition by Tesla was pitched as a great synergy.https://www.businessinsider.com/solarcity-tesla-energy-belea...There were a few lawsuits from Tesla shareholders about the acquisition regarding self dealing but they didn’t succeed:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarCity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So he just sold himself a company he already owns for a valuation that he himself assigned to that company but that was less than what he paid for it, and he paid entirely using “money” that has a made up value and which he issues himself?Wild.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In similar news: my left hand acquired my right hand today in an all stock deal valuing the combined hands at $1T. Praising the announcement my arms noted on the deal: “With these two hands now together, there’s nothing our combined fist of might can’t do.” Competitors, my left and right feet, declined to comment on the merger but are said to be in their own separate talks about a deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43509923</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an innovative approach to decomposing the factorial of a number into larger factors, specifically focusing on the formula \( n! \) represented as a product of integers that are significantly larger than one. It explores methods to identify such decompositions, the implications for number theory, and provides examples illustrating the process. The author emphasizes the mathematical significance and potential applications of this technique in various areas, including combinatorics and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43506238"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edit: as pointed out, you can't simply divide by each number, because then its not equal to original number factorial.  However, I've fixed the algorithm somewhat maintaining the basic ideaThe "naive" way  100!= 2*3*4*...*99*100

Obviously t(100) &gt; 1. If we can get rid of the single 2, we know that t(100) &gt; 2.  If you multiply the whole thing by 2/2 (=1),  100! = (2/2)*2*3*4*...*50*...99*100
       = (2*2/2)*3*4*...*50*...99*100
       = (4/2)*3*4*...*50*...99*100
       = 4*3*4*...*50*...99*(100/2)
       = 3*4*4*...*50*50*...99

We can continue with t(100) &gt; 3 by multiplying by 3/3 and pairing it with 99, i.e. 99*3*(3/3) = (99/3)*3*3 = 33*9  yielding  100! = 4*4*5*...*9*9*10*..*33*33*...*50*50...*97*98

However, once we get to t(100) &gt; 4, trying to get rid of 4, we have to skip 98 since its not divisible by 4.  The other problem is we have two 4s...  If we had instead using 98 for getting rid of 2, we can then use 100, and 96 for the other 4.  This is our first "gotcha" for the naive algorithm of always picking the largest number, which seems intuitive at first glance.Now if we test all possibilities starting with 2, we get 48 choices for the dividing 2 (even numbers &gt; 2, not including 2 which will not increase t(100) beyond 2.  Then ~33 choices for dividing 3 (depending if our div of 2 resulted in a factor of 3), ~25 for 4, But notice since we now have two 4s, we have to do it twice, so its 25*24 choices for getting rid of 4.*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Out of curiosity, I wondered how tight these bounds are. Consider the case of 300,000 which Terry has put a lower bound of 90,000 on, and would like a bound of 100,000 on. If a perfect division of factors into equal buckets could be achieved, the answer would be 110366.49020484093 per bucket. That's e^(log(n!)/n), to within the precision that Python calculates it. (My first try was to use Stirling's formula. That estimated it at 110366.49020476094, which is pretty darned close!)A straightforward greedy approach will see those final buckets differing by factors of around 2. Which is a lot worse than Terry's current approach.This really is a knapsack problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a kid I was bugged by the fact that Stirling formula doesn't give exact integer result, so I set to find my own formula. I failed, but discovered that sum from 1 to N is (n*n+n)/2. Surely if perfect formula for sum exists, for multiplication should exist too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43506238</guid></item><item><title>15.

There’s a significant number of MIPS tools in GCC that still work, the source and patches from that version still exist, and are open source. PS2 seems similar, but for the PSP they chose MetroWorks instead, which introduces some challenges, primarily just knowing quirks about the compiler.I wouldn’t be surprised if most languages supported by GCC (and possibly clang as a front end) could target many older systems as long as the runtime can be statically  compiled into the final binary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it still doesn't count until you burn a DVD that works on real hardware each time after an attempted compilation :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498481</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The episode "The Real Book" from 99% Invisible explores the intriguing history and significance of "The Real Book," a collection of jazz standards that has become a staple among musicians. Originally self-published in the 1970s, it was created by Berklee College of Music students as a way to share and access essential jazz tunes. The episode delves into the book's impact on jazz culture, the legal and ethical challenges of its distribution, and how it reflects the broader themes of musical tradition, accessibility, and innovation within the jazz community.&lt;/p&gt;

I think a lot of jazz people look down on it (or those who need it), but I didn't really get deep enough to see that.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of EU regulations on Apple's proprietary AWDL technology, which facilitates peer-to-peer communication over Wi-Fi. The EU’s push for interoperability and open standards has led to a shift towards cross-platform solutions, challenging the dominance of Apple’s system. It emphasizes the implications for developers and users, suggesting that while enhanced interoperability may benefit consumers, it could complicate the integration of existing technologies and reduce the seamless experience that AWDL provided. The piece ultimately highlights the tension between regulatory demands and technological innovation in the wireless communication space.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish there were some write-ups for doing wifi-p2p aka wifi-aware (the wifi alliance's proprietary branding for it) on Linux! Incredibly sad that it's just so so so undocumented; such a neat sounding suite of capabilities.Haven't looked in 2-3 years, but found so little ehm last I looked. Very dismaying. So many folks doing "p2p" file sharing apps, but generally they assume you have setup networking already. We really need to own the means of connectivity. Especially now!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently wanted to do point-to-point Wi-Fi for transferring some data but apparently support for the ad-hoc IBSS mode wasn't available on my MT7925. Wi-Fi Aware is completely new to me and didn't come up while searching on the topic at all. I can't find anything about using it on Linux now either. Anybody have any references on its support?There's a single kernel commit referencing Wi-Fi Aware from 2023 [0].
iw supposedly supports a few commands pertaining to it [1].  [0] https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=v6.14&amp;id=9b89495e479c5fedbf3f2eca4f1c4e9dd481265e

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off-topic, but the fact that this script even needs a package manager in a language with a standard library as large as Python is pretty shocking. Making an HTTP request js pretty basic stuff for a scripting language, you shouldn’t need or want a library for it.And I’m not blaming the author, the standard library docs even recommend using a third party library (albeit not the one the author is using) on the closest equivalent (urllib.request)!&gt; The Requests package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.Especially for a language that has not cared too much about backwards compatibility historically, having an ergonomic HTTP client seems like table stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone use PEP 723 + uv with an LSP based editor? What's your workflow? I looked into it briefly, the only thing I saw after a lot of digging around was to use `uv sync --script &lt;script file&gt;` and get the venv from the output of this command, activate that venv or specify it in your editor. Is there any other way, what I describe above seems a bit hacky since `sync` isn't meant to provide the venv path specifically, it just happens to display it.Edit: I posted this comment before reading the article. Just read it now and I see that the author also kinda had a similar question. But I guess the author didn't happen to find the same workaround as I mention using the `sync` output. If the author sees this, maybe they can update the article if it's helpful to mention what I wrote above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm generally not a fan of the incremental rustification of the Python ecosystem, but I started using uv a few weeks ago just for this particular case and have been liking it. And to the point where I'm considering to migrate my full projects as well from their current conda+poetry flow. Just a couple days ago I also modified a script I've been using for a few years to patch pylsp so it can now see uv script envs using the "uv sync --dry-run --script &lt;path&gt;" hack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43500124</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The page on Calabro.io introduces Zig, a programming language designed for optimal performance, safety, and simplicity. It highlights the language's ability to interoperate with C and its focus on ease of use for developers, making it suitable for both systems programming and high-level applications. The article also outlines the benefits of using Zig, including its compile-time code execution, safety features, and the elimination of hidden control flow, ultimately promoting productivity and reliability in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post seems to be missing an additional opportunity: Zig's build can involve go build!  Use Build.addSystemCommand, have it depend on library step, and have the install step depend on that step.  This reduces the steps to build to just 'zig build'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We tried this a few years back with a very loaded Go server using SQLite (actual C SQLite, not modernc.org/sqlite) and something made performance tank... likely some difference between glibc and musl. We never had time to hunt it down. We talked to Zig folk about sponsoring them to work on it, making performance comparable to glibc-built-SQLite, but they were busy at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the magic seems to happen in    const lib = b.addLibrary(.{
        .linkage = .static,
        .name = "cgo_static_linking",
        .root_module = lib_mod,
    });

and/*
#cgo LDFLAGS: -L./zig-out/lib -lcgo_static_linking -static
#include "zig_lib.h"
*/Now I can only guess why it works. A bit of an explanation wouldn't hurt.
Good post btw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505646</guid></item><item><title>21.

Does using this library make compilation expensive in the way that eg protobuf or nlohmann_json do?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow that api looks fantastic! Bravo!I'd like to read an even more thorough overview of how it works and all the gotchas before I'd consider using this 'in production' but the API looks very easy to use and very elegant.EDIT: just hit the section on portability, seems like you would always have to use that API, yeah? I feel like when you are writing network code you simply have to make it portable from the get-go. I guess I'm always thinking about having it run on client machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43508061</guid></item><item><title>22.

Device specs for six devices: 120-989 TFLOPS and 64-96 GB RAM.An RTX 5090 is about 105 TFLOPS.https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5090.c4216&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty surprised by the claimed memory usage for 300B parameters (table 1).
If we compare similar models:- Llama 3.1 with 405B parameters: 2 TB of memory (FP32), 500 GB (FP8)- DeepSeek R1 with 671B parameters: 1.3 TB (scaling linearly, around 600 GB for 300B parameters)Ling claims no more than 96 GB of memory, most likely for inference. That's far more than a 20% reduction. Am I missing something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is the one where they train LLM without NVIDIA GPU's.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43460455</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man, I'm really keen for this. The GBA Sonic games are often slept on but I think they were amazing at recreating the feel of the original Mega Drive games, with great music and sprite work too. I've long thought they deserved a modern PC port in the style of Sonic 1 Forever or Sonic Origins, to free them from the cramped GBA screen.Sonic fans have been making a lot of these unofficial, enhanced, moddable PC ports using decompilation, recompilation and emulation techniques, including Sonic 1 Forever, Sonic 3 A.I.R. and recently, the Sonic Unleashed PC port. PC (including Linux) is getting to be the definitive platform for playing a lot of these older Sonic games, which is great to see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love projects like these. Between decomps and static analyzers, we've seen so many fantastic games modernized and ported.Ocarina of Time is able to play natively on just about every system system imagineable (pretty sure native PS1 builds exist)
Sonic Unleashed, previously an 360/PS3 exclusive, now can be played in ultra wide on PC natively.Majoras Mask got a recent static deanalyzed PC port and has higher FOS and ultrawide mods.Perfect Dark for the N64 has a native PC port with ultrawide and mouse and keyboard controls.These are just a few off the top of my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shame... All those sprites and tile backgrounds are just begging for a DMCA take down. Why not just put up the tools that disassemble those from the ROM instead?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43500769</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That question regarding why orchestra performances  are subdue affairs came up recently when I attended a Lord of the rings concert in NYC. It wasn’t particularly rowdy, but people were certainly enjoying themselves. When I had posted about this on Reddit, there was a lot of attitudes about how it’s a uniquely American thing and at the European concerts people didn’t clap or laugh or audibly enjoy themselves as much as the NYC concert goers did. I’ll have to bookmark that link for later.Unrelated to the article, but related to the topic, the compliment that gives me the most dopamine is when somebody I respect and is above my level of knowledge tells me “that’s a great question”. It just makes me realize that I’m closer to their level if I’m asking questions that stumped them or that they are already thinking of but surprised I asked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comic on questions vs answers, "A Day At The Park", https://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Good questions" require understanding, a uniquely human concept as it exists strictly within the mind of a person."Great answers" can be identified as such by entities possessing understanding of the question posed.  As defined above, this is a uniquely human concept.Central to the above assertions are two words within the article's title; "good" and "great."  These are valuations ascribed by a person, not an algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498570</guid></item><item><title>25. 7.7 magnitude earthquake hits Southeast Asia, affecting Myanmar and Thailand</title><link>https://twitter.com/TaraBull808/status/1905534938558157139</link><description>

It's good enough, and it's free. I have switched over most of the non-technical people in my life to it, and they have no issues using it (except if they email a .pages document to a Windows user).I especially enjoy Numbers and the way you can arrange multiple tables on a page. It's a different paradigm coming from Google Sheets or Excel and takes some getting used to, but to me it now makes more sense.Of course, if I need something "done right", I'll drop down to Affinity, LaTeX, or InDesign. But I rarely have these needs nowadays.A similar argument could be made for going all in on Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, but I feel queasy knowing that all of my data is in a free Google account, after reading some of the stories here about reaching Google support if something goes sideways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I'm evaluating a potential application whose core functionality does not require external resources/servers (Dropbox for example) and they don't at a minimum offer some kind of perpetual fallback license (aka the Jetbrains annual subscription model), then I straight up bounce.Examples of good alternatives- Pixelmator &gt; Photoshop- Davinci Resolve &gt; Premiere- Reaper &gt; AuditionI have no interest in renting my tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish everyone would switch to LibreOffice so I can stop having to explain why their documents are formatted weirdly after I edit them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499860</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Byung-Chul Han in burnout society introduces the concept of hyperattention, which is the kind of attention that seems efficient at first, because it gives the impression of enabling you to multitask, but in reality it robs you from any deep and meaningful connection to anything around you.That's is pretty much what happens with anything tech nowadays. Because we see technology as a pure feat of rationality where in fact what we consume are nothing more than cultural artifacts, which will invariably reflect the fundamental problems of the society in which these artifacts are forged. In our case, in the Burnout Society, it's potentializing hyperattention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is largely correct, and I've personally been doing something similar to him for the last few year: purchasing physical media, shunning unnecessary smart gizmos that I don't directly control, and otherwise trying to just be disconnected for a period of time each day.Each time I find some small anachronistic way to be offline a little more I can feel myself relax just a bit.A well lived life is not an exercise in optimization, but our phones lead us to live that way. So, I think I'm done looking for the best way to do things for awhile, and I'm going to focus on finding the most enjoyable way to do them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree to a lot of this. But there is something even more disturbing than the constant surveillance. With the rise of AI we can no longer be sure if what we devote our attention to is an artefact of culture or just some derivative that has been automatically created to keep our attention up. And we ultimately have to ask ourselfs what the hell are we doing here? If history is removed from the artefact it becomes meaningless but how do we evaluate that and what is the consequence? Live music and theatre plays instead of movies and video games?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43509548</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research highlighting how certain tropical trees are negatively impacted by lightning strikes. Conducted by scientists at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the study reveals that while these trees have adapted to their environment, the increasing frequency of lightning due to climate change poses a significant risk to their health and survival. The findings underscore the need for further understanding of the ecological effects of changing weather patterns on tropical forests and the species that inhabit them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of how (small and regular) forest fires are actually healthy for giant sequoias.&gt; Giant sequoia cones are serotinous, which means that fire on the forest floor causes them to dry out, open and release their seeds. This adaptation ensures that the tree times the release of most of its seeds to coincide with fire, which creates ideal conditions for regeneration success. Fire burns off woody debris and exposes the soil, it creates an ash layer that returns nutrients to the soil and increases sunlight by killing some of the competing pines and firs.https://www.savetheredwoods.org/interactive/giant-sequoia-an...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“If you explained trees to someone who’d never heard of them—towers that drink through their feet, turn light into food, and whisper through fungal cables—they’d think it’s the craziest tech ever invented.” Add this to the list&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really cool, feels like the v1 of the lightning trees from Hyperion. Was hoping there was a breakdown of how the trees accomplish this. Will be interested to see follow up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505447</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of superhyperbolas, which are geometric shapes defined by certain mathematical equations. The author explains their properties, the relationships to other conic sections, and their applications in various fields such as physics and engineering. Additionally, the piece highlights the mathematical underpinnings of superhyperbolas, illustrating their significance and visually demonstrating their forms through graphs. Overall, the text aims to provide a deeper understanding of this lesser-known geometric structure and its relevance in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

First of all, the superellipse had an advocate, Piet Hein. If the superhyperbola has an advocate, he’s not a very effective advocate.Piet Hein was a designer. The superellipse, being closed, is a much more useful shape for designing physical objects, and fitting a roundish shape into a rectangular space is a useful property in our world of architectural square corners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s not clear why the superellipse would be common and the superhyperbola obscureI think the explanation is pretty obvious: The hyperbola itself is way more obscure than the ellipse to begin with, so it’s not surprising that hyperbola variations are also obscure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super-hyper-bola: the unstoppable bola.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "anti-orbit laser submarines," which are advanced military submarines equipped with laser technology capable of targeting objects in low Earth orbit. It explores the potential tactical advantages of using such submarines to counteract threats from satellites and other space-based assets. The piece analyzes technical challenges, strategic implications, and the role these submarines could play in modern warfare, emphasizing their potential to enhance national security by providing a deterrent against space-based attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The supercavitating supersonic submarine is a nice endpoint for the evasion discussion but I can't help thinking about the wake that would leave.Yes it can depart the firing area quickly but if one wanted to find it again for counterfire, surely the point where the absurd wake turbulence ends is a suitable search datum.Presumably an opponent with capable spaceships can spare the power required for scans along these principles: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S09242...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool idea. Atmospheric attenuation (regardless even if you lase at "transmissible" freqs), would be a major issue. Additionally, beam steering and focusing from 1000km+, and accounting (essentially a variable continuously changing integration) for a high variability in index of refraction would make it possible without a closed-loop feedback of on target strike.
Rough ballparks, I mean, the beam power density required would likely far exceed the thermal dissipation rate of any heat pipe, etc, tech I am officially aware of.
Space warfare is super fun tho. However, this is a very outdated idea. If anyone like noodling on this stuff, they should DM me. There are far better ideas... unofficially.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN, where one story is about hypothetical submarine spaceship laser battles, and the next is about usb-ps2 mouse port adapters, and you want to read them both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499755</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed a new method for dissolving plastic waste in the ocean quickly, potentially within just a few hours, without creating harmful microplastics. This innovative solution utilizes a specially designed chemical reaction that breaks down plastics into benign substances. The breakthrough could significantly address the growing problem of plastic pollution in marine environments, offering a promising approach to clean up oceans and improve ecological health.&lt;/p&gt;

Which is not itself a problem, but it's also useless garbage because neither the AI, nor the person generating it, appear to understand what is actually happening, and consequently the image is literally worse than useless. Image has what appear to be benzene rings, although the AI is clearly crossing that concept with neurons, but sodium hexametaphosphate has a fairly different shape: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hexametaphosphate that I would expect an artist to pick up on... and of course the cross-contamination of the neuron concept is just wrong.And even by strictly non-scientific standards, the ocean having two distinct surfaces, one below another, is just unsightly and obviously wrong. Alternatively, this plastic really does rip holes in the ocean's surface and directly expose The Murky Depths to the surface world in a geometrically anomalous manner, in which case for C'thulu's sake we should probably never manufacture this stuff in any quantity.I won't go so far as to say AI image generation shouldn't be used here, but this is a nominally educational context. It needs to be screened by someone who can make sure it actually means something other than "you are a dummy who can't handle too much text in a single block so here's some bling to stab your dopamine receptors so you can bear the terrible drudgery of continuing to read".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actual source (source of source of source):https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado1782More research from Takuzo Aida, which is quite impressive to read how they got there:https://www.science.org/authored-by/Aida/Takuzo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if that thing could be used as food packaging, since food has salt and water.Also that means this plastic probably has a very short lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505626</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that there is a difference between wanting to have more money and wanting to make more money.The author seems to be lucky in being born with the latter trait, but most humans luckily don't.If you're in the other group, feel free to simply ignore this advice.  Make money to support yourself and your surroundings, but don't feel sad that you can't constantly do the things you love.  It is just not how reality works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I would rather be poor than make a lot of money doing something I hate.I too would love to have that choice. But my wife and kids might disagree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"If you do something you love, you will become good at it much faster than something you don’t love, and when you are good at something you will have some opportunity to commercialize it."This sums up my life philosophy very well at this point. It also applies to kids and education, as I encourage my boy to do the things he loves (happens to be Minecraft and its thousands of mods, commands and other things to learn), and gently guide him over time to a place where he might be able to commercialize his skills in the future. It's amazing to see what a child is able to learn when they are obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470146</guid></item><item><title>36.

It prompted me to download it and play around.  It's very cool.  Despite being a complete novice, I learned a few things after a dozen hours of playing around:* I don't have a physical controller, but I can understand why people always use them.  Keyboard and mouse are not fully sufficient.* The built-in key and beat detection is really quite good for house music, and it gets you most of the way there in terms of managing song transitions (but not all the way there)* A side effect of consuming 99% of all of my music from youtube and spotify means I have no local library to feed into Mixxx (I ended up yt-dlp'ing a bunch of stuff)* There is a true art in song selection, and I don't possess this skill.[1] https://mixxx.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well written, tech heavy, and one of the best writeups I've seen on ripping vinyl to USB high speed SD cards.* And those were mentioned almost in passing, entirely not the point of the article, but so great to see!I want to also tell the world about Techno-club.net. There's a ton of UR-related artists still making true-spirit techno. Fantastic selektors!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avalon Emerson is such a great dj and producer. I’d love to see them live sometime - I’ve a great set from 2017 of theirs on SoundCloud that’s really eclectic.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of entropy in the context of information theory and cryptography. It explains how entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness of a system and highlights its significance in secure communication. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding entropy when designing cryptographic systems, as higher entropy translates to stronger security. The post also critiques common misconceptions about entropy, providing insights into its mathematical foundations and practical applications in maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, there's no actual need for this huge pile of random numbers. If you've somehow managed to generate one secure 256-bit key then from that key you can derive all the "random" numbers you'll ever need for every cryptographic protocol—and you can do this derivation in a completely deterministic, auditable, testable way, as illustrated by EdDSA. (If you haven't managed to generate one secure 256-bit key then you have much bigger problems.)This excerpt was the impetus to leave my job working for a company that makes a stupidly expensive high throughput hardware Quantum TRNG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There are also people asserting that it's important for RNGs to provide "prediction resistance" against attackers who, once upon a time, saw the entire RNG state.At this point we regularly have microarchitectural side-channels that can (with varying speed and reliability) leak kernel memory. It's easy to say "if someone can read kernel memory it's game over", but imho it's better to harden against state compromise than to not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this attack is less interesting than it sounds, given the specificity of the situation. IF you have a device which can read all the state/secrets on your machine AND the only write access it has to your machine is providing bits to use as an RNG seed, THEN (using this article) you can manipulate the output of the RNG, and exfil some data if you want.I'm struggling to come up with a situation where this would happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470339</guid></item><item><title>38.

The IO bottleneck data and the fio scripts are useful to all.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children are most hurt by low expectations.   Especially young children.There's subtlety to this, high demands are not high expectations.  If there's consequences for not meeting some high standard you set for children, you're going to create a very life-destroying kind of learned helplessness.  Kids shouldn't be punished for failure.And if it's something dangerous to try, then of course it's gotta be something you limit.But beyond that, just don't assume kids aren't ready for something without evidence.  Let them try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This should not be surprising to anyone who has a preschooler.  They're also way better at problem-solving than most people expect, it's just that you often don't want them solving their "problems".When my kid was 18 months old, we had gated him off from a playroom with a bunch of toys used by his older brother that were not baby-safe.  We had a DoorMonkey [1] placed up high, about 5 feet tall, so that only adults could reach.  My kid gets a chair from across the room, pushes it next to the door, climbs up on top of it, unlatches the DoorMonkey, pushes open the door, climbs down from the chair, enters the playroom, looks at me, and says "Bye!"  At that moment my wife gets out of the bathroom, sees the tableau, says "____?  What are you doing?" and my toddler says "Uh oh."[1] https://doormonkey.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was somewhat obvious. Kids are really smart in their limited context. It’s communication they need to learn.This is similar with people. Many people are quite intelligent, just not in a way we value or understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470138</guid></item><item><title>40.

We, the hackers and painters, would have the power to build world wide communities for addressing the climate collapse (the climate that provided good conditions for humanity to thrive). We have the wealth to work on solutions, we are the ones also contributing to burn the world, maybe because we have given up or because it is just too comfortable. We sit in our offices, home offices, letting everything collapse as long as the pizza and the next gadget reaches our desk. We control how information is distributed, we are responsible. We would be advised to take action; will we?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately we needed large scale climate engineering a decade ago.Oil is a key driver of economic activity, how would we ever convince governments, businesses, and finally individuals to cut their earnings before they “get theirs”. Sure we can get a significant portion of individuals to live a net-zero life, but there are far too many people who don’t care since everything seems normal if you are not paying attention.I want carbon neutrality, but I have no hope to achieving this before we face large scale ecological collapse (look at the GBR).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is why there is a race on for Greenland. (And Svalbard?)Ice melting in the Arctic is not a linear process.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses a method for using images as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to gather spatial and motion data. It outlines the approach of leveraging visual information from images to capture movement and orientation, presenting potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and motion tracking. The content explains the technical aspects of the method, including algorithms used for processing image data and examples of successful implementations, emphasizing the advantages of using image-based data over traditional IMUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Unbearable Loudness of Chewing" discusses the phenomenon of misophonia, a condition where individuals experience strong emotional reactions to specific sounds, particularly those related to chewing or eating. It explores the psychological and neurological aspects of misophonia, detailing how everyday sounds can trigger feelings of anger or disgust in affected individuals. The piece also examines potential causes, coping strategies, and the impact of this condition on social interactions. Through personal anecdotes and expert insights, the article aims to raise awareness about misophonia and its effects on daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most frustrating thing about it is that very many people take it extremely personally if there's even a whisper of a suggestion that they could eat more quietly. To the extent some people will "revenge chew" to make a point that it could be worse. For some reason, that's a huge taboo, and it seems to cross all cultures. The only relationship I can think of where you can say "close your mouth when chewing" and not risk major offense is a parent-child one.The only thing I find to improve it is to not be tired or stressed when eating with others, or lively conversation as a distraction. Easy, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's completely psychological for me (as in, not a medical mystery). I have a strong, deep-seated association between loud eating and inconsiderateness, because it's often unnecessary (ostensibly). Grossness is part of it, but that's secondary - more of a multiplier rather than being the core problem. It's about the perceived unnecessary-ness: Chewing with your mouth open, biting the spoon, vocalizing, slurping, talking with your mouth full. However, there are other reasons for these things: Cultural, physiological. One often probably doesn't even notice one is doing it. Also, if it doesn't bother you, you may not even be aware that it bothers somebody else (or have trouble sympathizing).The trouble is willing myself into accepting these reasons. The thought "Why are you doing that. Don't you notice?" is nigh unavoidable. It takes conscious effort to not show signs of irritation externally. Sometimes I simply have to politely remove myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I regret constantly hitting my little brother when he was chewing with his mouth open at the dinner table. I was about 13 and had developed misophonia, he must have been 5. Our parents didn't understand it. I didn't understand it. I couldn't control myself for years. He was a sweet boy in a poor and dysfunctional family that also fell apart around that time. At the very least, he deserved a better brother.Decades later, I still get abruptly and irrationally angry when people smack their lips, though I have learnt to suppress the urge to assault the source of the sound.I can't eat with my Chinese colleagues. I get that more air makes each bite taste better, but it is hard to eat or even focus when your brain is telling you to rip their heads off to stop the sound.It's an odd curse to live with, as, aside from the situation with my brother, I have otherwise never hurt or assaulted anyone in my life and am generally regarded as a softy. I have to force myself to sit at the dinner table with my mother when she visits, as she still smacks her lips.Some people smack their lips in quick succession when they taste something new, like how birds drink water, and it drives me up the walls. Slurping is triggering, but not as much. Some people swallow excessively as presenters and will make a "tsk" sound with their tongues before speaking, which is worse than slurping and usually causes me to stop watching the presentation.I'm glad there is some traction with misophonia research. We need help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470493</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a unique marketing experiment by Levi's, where the brand is testing a direct-sales strategy through Amazon by offering a curated selection of jeans. This initiative aims to explore new retail channels and reach a wider audience while leveraging Amazon's vast platform.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Denim head) Anecdata - buying Levis from Amazon (or any other store), pick up at least a couple of pairs in the same size. It's likely different people/factories making them, but often you'll find variation in size/denim even when the labelling in the same. One pair of 32/32 might feel 'off' and the next is the best pair you've ever owned. Completely agree with going 'smaller' brand if you want consistency though (and that's a whole different world).But better tip - (if you're not looking for 'smart' denim) buy from eBay. Only buy pairs where everything has been measured properly (waist, inside leg, rise, etc) so you can get close to what you know you fits. You can find 20+ year old Levis for less than $20 - the denim is heavier, the quality is good and they have that perfect 'broken in' feel that makes the jeans feel like your best friend. Plus you can afford to try a few pairs to find ones you love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [...] one pair ordered from Amazon, one pair sent by Levi’s for each style. [...] It seemed the tipster was half right. The tests confirmed a lot of variability between two pairs of the same jeans — you could buy the same style from Amazon and Levi’s and feel a difference. But it didn’t add up to gaps in quality; there was no indication that the Levi’s from Amazon were worse.All this time, researchers have been wasting money on sample sizes larger than 1 before drawing conclusions.Also, I find the word "commingling" nowhere in the article.  It's very relevant to the question of what product you're receiving when you buy from Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if Levis are, but I have absolutely ordered other branded items that are different on amazon compared to in a store, including entirely different and lower quality fabric on amazon.It's not at all surprising for anything to happen after co-mingled inventory, which should absolutely be illegal.Walmart created a business practice where many black Friday deals were lower quality products produced explicitly for black Friday sales. So underhanded deceptive business practice in large retailers isn't anything new.Without a regulatory authority we can expect companies to act in decreasingly bad faith, because who will provide consequences, the other definitely not colluding competitor?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504451</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, this might suggest some male wasps' seventh abdominal segment is conserved.Modern female wasps having other than six abdominal segments I believe to be unknown, and is certainly unknown to me; while fertilized or "foundress" females do share with males the need for extra body space to support functioning and thus unusually large reproductive organs, females specialized for the reproductive role display morphological differences beginning from larvahood to accommodate the task. (In eusocial species, reproductive females or 'gynes' differ from workers or 'ergates' in having the ability to be inseminated; in subsocial species, gynes are raised and fed for the role from birth and as a result simply grow up extra big and strong, with noticeably larger abdomens in body proportion than their sisters whose labor is less deferred.)edit: Fixed a bug resulting from a Wikipedia editor doing a lousy job with taxonomy. It is actually possible that some lineal relationship exists between structures described here and those of modern male wasps with a seventh gastral segment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It wasn't clear to me how this was like a Venus fly trap: the wasp grabbed prey with a rib cage and... what? Hung on to it till it's larvae developed and consumed the victim ... or what? Sorry, can someone ELI5?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43508817</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses JEP 483, which introduces a mechanism for Ahead-of-Time (AOT) class loading and linking in Java. It explains how this feature improves application startup time and reduces runtime memory overhead by allowing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to perform these processes earlier in the compilation stages. The post details the technical aspects of the implementation, its potential benefits for developers, and examples demonstrating how AOT class loading can enhance performance in Java applications. Additionally, it highlights compatibility considerations and future implications for the Java ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the big problem here is conceptual. The JDK folks are looking at this akin to PGO when, IMHO, they should be looking at this as an AOT cache (yes, the flag names make this even more confusing). How do those two differ, you ask?With PGO you do a lot of deliberate work to profile your application under different conditions and feed that information back to the compiler to make better branch/inlining decisions.
With a AOT cache, you do nothing up front, and the JVM should just dump a big cache to disk every time it exits just in case it gets stared again on the same host. In this case, training runs would just be a” run you did to create the cache". With that said, the big technical challenge right ow is that building the AOT cache is expensive hence performance impacting and cannot really be done alongside a live application - but that’s where I think the focus should be, making filling the aot cache something less intensive and automatic.Another aspect this strategy would help with is “what to do with these big AOT cache files”, if the AOT cache really starts caching every compiled method, it will become essentially another so file possibly of a size greater than the original JAR it started off with. Keeping this is in a docker image will double the size of the image slowing down deployments. Alternatively, with the aot cache concept, you just need to ensure there is some form of persistent disk cache across your hosts. The same logic also significantly helps CLIs, where I dont’ want to ship a 100MB CLI + Jlink bundle and have to add another 50MB of aot cache in it - what I do want is every time the client uses my CLI the JVM keeps improving the AOT cache.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The AOT cache file has a size of 66 MB in this case. It is considered an implementation detail and as such is subject to change between Java versions.Does this mean this is mostly focused on containerised environments? I assume it means you couldn't upgrade the JVM on a server and know that this will keep working?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503960</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you spend time on places that attract newbie programmers (some subreddits focused on game dev or game engines, for example) you’ll see the outcome of “I no longer think you should learn to code.” And it’s not pretty.Many, many posts of people looking for help fixing AI-generated code because the AI got it wrong and they have no idea what the code even does. Much of the time the problem is simply an invented method name that doesn’t exist, a problem that is trivially solved by the error message and documentation. But they say they’ve spent several days or whatever going back and forth with the AI trying to fix it.It’s almost a little sad. If they just take the time to actually learn what they’re doing they’ll be able to accomplish so much more.Now of course people learning the traditional way have these same problems, but they’re debugging code they wrote, not gobbledygook from an AI. It’s also easier to explain the solution to them because they wrote the code, so it tends to be simpler. Several times I’ve pitied someone asking for help with AI code and even when I explained the solution they still didn’t understand it, and I had to just give up on them - I’m not getting paid to help them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a professor at a small college. I teach intro programming most semesters and we're now moving to using tools like Cursor with no restrictions in upper-level courses."How do students learn to code nowadays?" - I think about this pretty much all the time.In my intro class, the two main goals are to learn about structured programming (using loops, functions, etc.) and build a mental model of how programs execute. Students should be able to look at a piece of code and reason through what it does. I've moved most of the traditional homework problems into class and lab time, so I can observe the students coding without using AI. The out-of-class projects are now bigger and more creative and include specific steps to teach students how to use AI collaboratively.My upper-level students are now doing more ambitious and challenging projects. What we've seen is that AI moves the difficulty of programming away from remembering details of languages or frameworks, but rewards having a careful, structured development process:- Thinking hard and chatting about the problem and the changes you need to implement before doing anything- Keeping components encapsulated and thinking about interfaces- Controlling the scope of your changes; current AIs work best at the function or class level- Testing and validation- Good manual debugging skills; you can't rely on AI to fix everything for you- General system knowledge: networking, OS, data formats, databasesOne of my key theories is that AI might lower the value of "computer science" as a standalone major, but will lead to a lot more coding across fields that currently don't use it. The intersection of "not a traditional engineer" and "can work with AI to solve problems with code" is going to be an emerging skill set that will change a lot of disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rise of tools like Cursor reminds me of the Industrial Revolution in France. When machines first appeared in factories, unskilled workers who didn’t understand how they operated often got injured - sometimes quite literally losing fingers. But for skilled craftsmen, these machines became force multipliers, dramatically increasing productivity and improving overall living standards.The same applies to software development. If you lack the fundamentals - how memory, I/O, networking, and databases work - you’re at risk of building something fragile that will break under real-world conditions. But for those who understand the moving parts, tools like Cursor supercharge efficiency, allowing them to focus on high-level problem-solving rather than boilerplate coding.Technology evolves, but the need for deep knowledge remains. 
Those who invest in learning the craft will always have the advantage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503295</guid></item><item><title>50.

It emphasizes that both tools serve similar purposes in aiding developers to interactively explore and test code. The author highlights how debugging can be viewed as a form of interactive programming, paralleling the dynamic nature of REPLs, and suggests that integrating these concepts can enhance the debugging experience.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related, "Django's REST (Framework) Problem" — https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510495I'm not sure that many people who rely on Django Rest Framework are aware that last month the bug tracker was made private and the project is looking for new maintainers.I love Django but the project needs to go through something similar to Angular's renaissance (and Angular needs to learn from Django docs.) I'd love to help but it seems that most of the efforts to address the issue have been stalled in committee.A fork probably isn't the answer but something needs to be done. If it's a money issue, pass the plate! Whenever I talk to Django devs about contributing the feeling that I'm left with is that I could put in years of work, jump through every hoop, and at the end of it they may still say "We're not sure."The feeling that I've gotten is that the Django dev community is very small and tight-knit. Whenever I've talked about helping out on various projects I've walked away with the feeling that their friend is handling it and they'd rather leave them to it. The community has been trained, through years of reinforcement, to wait instead of getting involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've some mixed feelings about this fork. On the one hand, I get the motivations, there is alway a lot of value in experimenting outside of a legacy project. But at the same time, I cant help but feel uneasy seeing something I've deeply respected and used on for years being split off in this way, "fork of Django" is a big statement.Part of that discomfort comes from a sense that the collective effort into Django is being sidestepped rather than built upon. It feels like a "saas-fication" effort, like Ruff, Docker, Terraform, etc but instead of going from creating something new it replaces something that already works. I worry about the potential for a more commercial or narrow direction that doesn't embody honestly the open, thoughtful mission thats made Django so special.I'm in love of boring software.I care about Django more than I realized. Seeing this has actually pushed me with a gut emotion to want to get more involved contributing code, writing, or just participating more with DjangoIt's not about the tool or the language, I want to feel different about the community that is open and respectful of contribution and values long term relations.It's not fun to be boring, but boring is good&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems weird to me. The strength of Django is the ORM and the ecosystem/idioms.Why would I break compatibility with the latter by taking a fork?I would love to see better admin (so many have tried to do this) but it’s unclear to me why the goodstuff here can’t be a Django project template.  (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/releases/1.4/#custom-p...)As a longtime user if I want anything different these days it’s a lighter-weight experience like Django Ninja or FastAPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512589</guid></item><item><title>2. Why Apple's Severance gets edited over remote desktop software</title><link>https://tedium.co/2025/03/29/severance-apple-remote-editing-weirdness/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unconventional editing practices and experiences of the Apple TV+ series "Severance," which has generated intrigue and attention. It explores how the show's unique narrative structure and thematic elements draw viewers into a complex world, highlighting the surreal nature of work-life balance and the psychological implications of corporate culture. The piece emphasizes the creative choices made during production and the resulting impact on audience engagement, while also reflecting on broader trends in remote work and media consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Keynote to make my presentations, and one time I wanted to build a presentation with someone else.  I asked my friend who has worked at Apple for 20 years, "How do you guys build Keynote presentations together?  There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do that?".He said, "We don't collaborate at Apple because of the (perceived) risk of leaks.  None of our tools are built for collaboration".  Apple is famously closed about information sharing, to the point where on some floors every office requires its own badge, and sometimes even the cabinets within.So it doesn't surprise me that their video editing tools are designed for a single user at a time.Edit:  This happened about six years ago, they have since added some collaboration tools, however it's more about the attitude at Apple in general and why their own tools lag on collaboration.Edit 2:  After the replies I thought I was going crazy.  I actually checked my message history and found the discussion.  I knew this happened pre-COVID, but it was actually in 2013, 12 years ago.  I didn't think it was that long ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ex VFX person here.It was quite common to have remote desktop cards on high end machines so that you could hide them away somewhere quiet. The edit stations/Flame/Baselite machines all hada  fucktonne of 15k sas drives in them, so were really noisy.You couldn't invite a director to see what you were doing, when all you can hear is disk/fan whine.They were quite expensive because they needed to be able to encode and send 2k video in decent bitdepth (ie not 420, but 444), and low latency. Worse still they needed to be calibrateable so that you could make sure that the colour you saw was the colour on the other end.Alas, I can't remember what they are called, thankfully, because they are twats to manage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, but this misses perhaps the most embarrassing part: They're using Avid and not FCP.I also don't buy the author's rationale for remote editing; it's oddly archaic: "high-end video production is quite storage-intensive, which is why your favorite YouTuber constantly talks about their editing rigs and network-attached storage. By putting this stuff offsite, they can put all this data on a real server."Storage is cheap now, and desktop computers are more than powerful enough for any video editing. Any supposed advantage of remote "real servers" is going to be squandered by having to send everything over the Internet. The primary benefit of remote editing (and the much-hyped "camera to cloud") is fast turnaround, which you need for stuff like reality TV and news. But a dramatic series like Severance?It is pretty baffling that Apple would create a PR vehicle that impugns its products like this. It would be better to say nothing. After Apple acquired Shake, they splashed Lord of the Rings, King Kong, and other major tentpoles on the Apple homepage at every opportunity... of course not mentioning that Weta was rendering those movies on hundreds of Linux servers instead of Macs. But at least Shake was the same product across all platforms, and it really was the primary effects tool on all those movies."they do not mention the use of Jump Desktop, which seems like a missed opportunity to promote a small-scale Mac developer. C’mon Apple, do better.)Oh boy, this is just a minor infraction in Apple's history of disrespect toward developers. They do this, and worse, to major development partners too. I'm not going to name names, but after one such partner funded the acquisition of material on its own equipment and that material was used in a major product keynote... Apple not only neglected to credit or even mention that partner, but proceeded to show the name of a totally uninvolved competitor in its first slide afterward. The level of betrayal there was shocking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517301</guid></item><item><title>3.

The UI feels so delightful and well thought out. I guess I found another weekend (multi-week?) activity.If you're looking for hackathon projects, the E-ink ecosystem is well developed enough that they're pretty easy to program against and Claude/the AIs can pick up the API surface. Plus, people generally don't know what they're looking at -- you have to say "kindle-style screen" -- but people (me? but also guests) do seem to prefer having a e-ink screen in the living room over a backlit display because it's so much less intrusive.FWIW, E-ink [0] AND pomdoros [1] are each a whole thing of mine.[0] https://sambroner.com/posts/raspberry-pi-train[1] https://sambroner.com/posts/personal-analytics-2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always interested to see a "device" type of project on here -- they tend to be the most challenging, even if the goal is simple. The intersection of object design, electronics and code is a great playground.I really like the choice of screen, and generally the considerations given (and explained in the readme!) for purpose and usability.Couple of notes on the object design (and this is something I find very challenging, and spend a lot of time iterating on)- What if the knob was on top of the device, wide and flat? you could center the screen, make the device smaller, and the physical action of turning it would be less likely to push the box around- Chamfers and fillets go a long way to make a thing look polished -- it's a small detail, but the difference between a sharp edge and a rounded one somehow seems to matter a lot.- Since the menu always has three options, what if instead of the knob there were three buttons on the top surface (like the "snooze" of an alarm clock)? Fewer interactions to fiddle with!- You can get translucent filament, and it makes for very cool "light conduit" parts -- eg, the LED box could be solid, and it would look like something from an 80s dashboard. Alternately, you could print a border for the screen, and light that up instead, making for a more minimalist design.(Sorry, I can't help it, I like thinking about these things)How did you design the knob, OpenSCAD? The knurling is a nice touch, and looks like it was done in a programmatic way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43514383</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in how the mountains and rivers are generated, it's mostly based on the paper "Large Scale Terrain Generation from Tectonic Uplift and
Fluvial Erosion": Each chunk rises (at a noise-based, constant rate) while erosion is applied based on the chunk's slope and the size of its catchment area.The result is a river network as well as the central height of each chunk; based on this roads, caves and structures are laid out. The actual voxels are only determined when a player loads the area and are (usually) not persisted.Also, for some technologies not related to worldgen: Rendering is done via wgpu, models are built in MagicaVoxel, and both client and server use an ECS (specs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minor note that installation via the launcher (Why a launcher!?!) seems a bit broken. Both the direct mac download, and installing from Cargo, installs Airshipper v0.15.0. This says that it's outdated and to install a new version. Clicking the button to do this takes you to the Github releases page, where the latest version is 0.14. There's a december release for v0.16 but it's a tag only and has no artifacts. Quit in frustration.Edit: Despite having an issues page, the GitHub page of the launcher is apparently only a mirror of the GitLab repository. GitLab has artifacts for the latest version. I am mystified why they send people to the GitHub page on their officially linked and `cargo install` downloads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related.

Don't actually do this, this is bad advice.Just like a lecturer won't suddenly switch to a German accent when saying words like "schadenfreude" or names like "Friedrich Nietzsche", neither should a screen reader. Having your voice constantly change under you for no apparent reason is distracting more than anything else.What you should do this for are longer pieces of text in a foreign language, like a multi-paragraph piece of text to analyze in a foreign language textbook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richard Zach et al. logic textbooks are a work of art: https://slc.openlogicproject.org.Aside, I'd be happy to pay for great classic math textbooks in a well typeset edition.Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces is one such example.

That was a fun time.The physical board and magnets definitely add a cool factor to it as does the physical dexterity element. Nice project![1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Chess&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; so this should be a pretty uncontroversial minor rules updateMy kind of humor.Always found it an interesting aspect of chess that the most "common sense" rules (Players take turns; no skipping; one move per turn) result in the most unintuitive outcomes and a massive increase in complexity: Suddenly you can reason about the pieces a player won't be able to move in a turn, you can double-bind players, you get draws where its provably impossible for any player to win, etc.(In that sense, chess is a bit like the IntercalScript language earlier today: All features are superficially reasonable and in the service of simplicity, yet result in the weirdest outcomes)Wouldn't all this be gone for  chess without turns?Or would strategies become even more intricate, e.g. taking into account the minimum time you'd require to physically move a piece?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43514695</guid></item><item><title>8.

You can try it out by downloading the binary from the repo[1]. It is also available on npm, as a vscode extension and via nvim-lspconfig and mason.[2]We fell into plenty of rabbit holes along the way, but dug our way out of each. We're now using mostly pragmatic, almost naive solutions for our problems.You can find more details in this blog post.[3]Try it out and let us know what breaks. Bug reports, ideas, and contributions are all welcome-especially if you want to hack on some Rust.Last, but not least, we want to give a shoutout to Biome[4]. We spent a lot of time studying their codebase and have been adopting many of their approaches. We wouldn't be here without their work.[0] Announcement Show HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37020610[1] Repository: https://github.com/supabase-community/postgres-language-serv...[2] Installation Guides: https://pgtools.dev/#installation[3] Blog Post: https://www.supabase.com/blog/postgres-language-server[4] Biome: https://biomejs.dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;co-author here: The most interesting part is probably the parsing of SQL files.The first issue is that the Postgres parser is complex and always changing, so you can't really roll your own parser to parse SQL. 
The second is that the parser only works with valid and complete SQL statements, but an LSP should help you with those that are invalid or incomplete.The simple solution is to actually use two parsers – the original   libpg_query   that's used by Postgres itself, and   tree-sitter   for incomplete statements, and merge the parsed results.
With that, you can both get a workable AST for diagnostics and tree-sitters CST for autocompletion, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;This project provides a toolchain for Postgres development,I'm a little bit confused about what "Postgres development" is in this context. Is this for people writing stored procedures in Postgres? Or people writing other kinds of large and complex queries that merit language server support?I'm just kind of curious what uses cases are out there for something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513996</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of "carcinisation" as it applies to Sony's PlayStation brand, suggesting that over time, it has evolved to resemble a more commercially driven and less innovative entity, akin to how some species evolve into crab-like forms. The author critiques recent developments and trends in the PlayStation ecosystem that prioritize profit over creative risk-taking, indicating a shift towards a more formulaic and homogenized gaming experience. The piece reflects on the broader implications of this trend within the gaming industry and the potential consequences for players and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Off topic: I hate so much what Krisp (the desktop app) has become. It was the perfect background noise cancelling tool, and now is asking permissions to record your whole screen and audio, for AI meeting companion features I couldn’t care about one bit. And they make it such a frustrating pain to opt-out, with constant modals tricking you in enabling all those AI features.Does anyone know an alternative that achieves similar level of background noise cancelling?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; low algorithmic latency of just 15 millisecondsI guess overall latency will be higher since processing will have to go to their server than back to our server then back from our server to STT provider and back to as then back to LLM provider and back to us and last part to TTS provider and back to the user.It's so weird that e.g. OpenAI doesn't provide a way to make very simple voice pipeline STT + LLM + TTS executed totally on their servers, this would reduce latency significantly.The pipeline with this server side audio processing right now looks mostly would have to look like that:user phone -&gt; our server -&gt; krisp server -&gt; our server -&gt; OpenAI STT -&gt; our server -&gt; OpenAI LLM -&gt; our server -&gt; OpenAI TTS -&gt; our server -&gt; back to user.Then you have to hope that user and all servers are hosten in the same region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently I was practicing QA with ChatGPT, I wondered if I say "stay silent for 4 seconds before talking" will it work? lo and behold, it didn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43467988</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article details a DIY project where the author, Jeff Geerling, explains how to create a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Grandmaster Clock using a Raspberry Pi. It provides step-by-step instructions, including the necessary hardware and software components, configuration settings, and coding needed to set up the clock. The goal is to achieve accurate time synchronization for network devices, making it an informative guide for tech enthusiasts looking to enhance their understanding of time management in digital networks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just wanted to note: the entire configuration I'm building out is automated to run on any Debian/Ubuntu OS (not just a Pi), and my intent is to make NTP + PTP setup much more approachable for those who want to tinker with it.The project is on GitHub: https://github.com/geerlingguy/time-piThe blog post has more color/story around it, but the meat of it is over on GitHub, and right now I'm working my way through testing different network switches, installing an external GPS antenna, etc.Also, if you're a PTP nerd, you might want to check out a project from the OCP-TAP, the Switchberry, an open hardware design for a PTP boundary/transparent clock with 7 ports! [1] This was built by the same PCB designers as the TimeHAT featured in my blog post, and I'm trying to hammer out some bugs in the bringup so they can be nice, lower-cost options for networks where you don't have the budget or need for enterprise-level PTP offerings, but still want a decent DIY setup.[1] https://github.com/Time-Appliances-Project/Incubation-Projec...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're looking to setup a GPS-disciplined time-server at home, I highly recommend this writeup: https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/14/revisiting-microse...In the author's latest post he also sets up a pi as PTP grandmaster: https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/18/nanosecond-accurat...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fully expect the results would make anyone with deep knowledge of PTP laugh at loud at how inaccurate/imprecise it is, but I still love for wifi to get a PTP.There's so much audio and video stuff that works so much better with ptp. Even if it's vastly less good, its still gotta be some way to keep systems running on the same time, and that's a huge win. I'd love to see wifi PTP happen.There's some really incredible research work a team did a while back, hacking their own PTP implementation stop a specific driver (adding timestamps to ath9k). https://github.com/zlab-pub/wifi-ptp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510036</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;vramfs is a virtual filesystem designed for efficiently managing storage in video memory (VRAM) for graphics applications. It allows developers to create, read, and write files directly in the VRAM, improving the performance of graphics-intensive applications by reducing the overhead associated with transferring data between system RAM and VRAM. The project includes functionalities for mounting and working with files in a seamless manner, making it particularly useful for games and real-time rendering systems. The GitHub repository provides installation instructions, usage examples, and documentation to help developers integrate vramfs into their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's cool but I think the proper solution is to write a Linux kernel module that can reserve GPU RAM via DRM to create ramdisks, not create a userspace filesystem using OpenCL.That would give proper caching, direct mmap support if desired, a reliable, correct and concurrent filesystem (as opposed to this author's "all of the FUSE callbacks share a mutex to ensure that only one thread is mutating the file system at a time"), etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of coercing bits into functioning as data storage:

&lt;p&gt;The document provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) TURN server for WebRTC applications. It details the prerequisites required for installation, including necessary software and dependencies, as well as step-by-step instructions for configuring and running the server. Key sections include understanding TURN server functionality, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips to ensure optimal performance. The guide aims to equip users with the knowledge needed to effectively deploy a TURN server for enhanced WebRTC communications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;99% of this does not depend on Oracle, you can do this on any vm hosting platform you can get. The only point of using Oracle is the price point which will vanish as soon as they can cease using it to build market share. Good to show btw. Nice instructions. They're  mostly platform neutral. It might be a different interface to manage on another host of course but the outcome would be much the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has got me reading about TURN and it just seems like a huge ugly hack. Two computers want to send UDP to each other. They are electrically connected by sets of physical cables. They could even be down the street from each other. But they don’t know how to get their routers to set the right bits in their translation tables. Instead it’s just easier to send all their traffic through a third computer in another city thousands of miles away or maybe into outer space and back. Have I got it right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Additionally, some people have privacy concerns about running their data through anything associated with the big G.It's important to point out that Web RTC is E2E encrypted, so Google never actually sees your data.As long as the server you use for signaling is secure, your TURN server may as well be run by the NSA. Since initial signaling is extremely low-bandwidth compared to the actual call, it's usually fine to handle it in your application directly.THe actual problem with WebRTC is that, in its default setup, every call participant leaks their IP address to everybody else, and you need to upload your data n-1 times for n call participants, making it almost unusable on slow connections. You can mitigate both of these problems with an SFU, essentially a central server that takes in streams from all clients and distributes them further, but then you lose the E2E.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510710</guid></item><item><title>16. Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern Language (2023)</title><link>https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for testing software without using mocks, specifically in the context of nullable types in programming. It emphasizes the benefits of testing real instances of objects rather than relying on mock objects, which can lead to more reliable and maintainable tests. The author provides practical examples and techniques for implementing this approach, highlighting how it can simplify testing and improve code quality by focusing on actual behavior rather than simulated interactions. Overall, the piece advocates for a testing philosophy that embraces real-world scenarios to enhance the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470192"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty fond of this article. I think it's an interesting approach, and I think you can generalize it out into some very useful principles.The big takeaway, I think, is that a particular module of code should encapsulate its own test double configuration &amp; injection behind a set of testing factories. So rather than this:    m = new FooMock()
    m.call("Bar", 1, 2)
    m.call("Baz", 3)
    p = new thing.ThingDoer(m)
    actual = p.doThing()
    assert(expected == actual)

Do something like this:    p = thing.makeThingDoerForTest(1, 2, 3)
    actual = p.doThing()
    assert(expected == actual)

Shore's "nullables" are a version of this, but to me it doesn't really matter what makeThingDoerForTest is doing internally to build the mocked-up test version of a ThingDoer. What matters is that the test doesn't have to worry about it: It's the Thing module's responsibility to correctly set up the test doubles involved. The unit test can use a special constructor that exposes only the minimum necessary configuration, and then implementation details about how ThingDoer interacts with Foo can be hidden inside the Thing module, as they should be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is a very thorough article. Aside from using unfamiliar terms, nearly every concept is valuable and familiar. I am a big proponent of not mocking / no mocking frameworks/libraries. 15+ years of building large SaaS systems with hundreds of contributors and optimizing for testing so deployment is the best balance of safe and fast.I use nearly every pattern mentioned to write my tests in Go. I now use the same patterns in Python where I can - this new org is less mature in its testing solution and mocks and spaghetti abound.For similar, Go specific resources look up, "Go fakes vs mocks."Other related reading on reasons to avoid mocks: https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.htmlfwiw, not a fan of a couple techniques like nullables and prefer Fakes/Fake Constructors, but it is splitting hairs. Overall the message is correct: avoid mocking. Have a way for systems under test to have implementation details changed while interfaces remain the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, a breath of fresh air. I read this before I went to sleep, hoping to wake up to some kind of revelation I might share in a comment like this, but no luck. I'm still torn.I remember writing tests in not very powerful languages like Java in 2005. Back then the idea was that you just need to decouple your objects, add interfaces for everything, and you will reap good design, courtesy of being forced to by TDD. What I usually saw was an overly complex code base with dependency injection and difficult to debug problems at runtime.This article seems like the natural evolution of this thinking, but turning it around: It's not saying a unit that wants to be tested needs to enable tests. It's saying a unit used by other units needs to support _them_ being tested. Maybe I'm easy to impress, but I find that refreshingly novel, wondering why I never thought of it.OTOH, with powerful mocking frameworks and more dynamic features even in static languages, the part of the industry I've been a witness to took another turn: Let units do whatever they want, focusing just on what's needed in production, and in order to test them, we'll build an elaborate fake environment for them. The major downside being that people changing a unit need to worry about whatever elaborate fakes _other_ units have created for them in their tests.So it's coupling vs decoupling production code and tests. The former approach makes it easier to author and maintain test suites. The latter approach makes it easier to reason about production code.In the last decade or so, I've valued the latter more, despite the drawbacks. With this style, coupling production code and tests is suddenly on the table for me again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470192</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is fascinating that a large percentage of modern Americans believe (taught in school or through Disney movies) that prior to the arrival of Europeans; native American tribes were peaceful to each other.They often think that the land was inhabited by loving tribes that just wanted to be left alone to live in harmony with nature.The truth is that barbarism was common as tribes routinely slaughtered each other in numerous wars. Slavery, rape and human sacrifice were here far before the White man arrived.I am not saying that the conquerers from Europe didn't do some horrible things too; just that the narrative often taught in schools is inaccurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s almost kind of more impressive that the Incan empire of maybe 10 million people got by on the barter system.In _Debt_, Graeber argues that it is largely a myth that pre modern civilizations relied on barter, and instead used different systems for tracking debt between individuals and entities.He says this of the Incas knotted strings in a footnote:&gt; I note in passing that a study of the Inca khipu system itself would itself be quite fascinating in this regard; the strings were used to record both obligations we would consider financial, and others we would consider ritual, since as in so many Eurasian languages, the words “debt” and “sin” were the same in Quechua as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you enjoyed the article, consider listening to the Fall of civilisations podcast.

If an iCloud user had ever used a custom domain, future emails from iCloud to that domain would still get routed to their iCloud inbox—even if the domain’s MX record no longer pointed to Apple. They eventually fixed it, but didn’t think it deserved a bounty, which was a bit surprising.I'm sure there's a ton of interesting surface area here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, Apple sends the wrong EHLO domain when trying to send emails out.

It's such a wonderful movie, one I hoped at release would find a much bigger audience as it really deserves to be seen and shows that Lynch wasn't a guy who just made weird things, he made great things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What about the 1999 PlayStation 2 advertisement disguised as a futuristic 2078 commercial for the PlayStation 9 [1]?

Then, as the class was winding up, he joked and said "just kidding, don't do that... here's how we can do this with a Taylor expansion", and proceeded to derive the same identity in what felt like 30 seconds.Also, don't forget the Jacobian and gradient aren't the same thing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those looking for a shorter primer could consult https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01528&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3b1b classic on this topic with beautiful visualizations: https://youtu.be/O85OWBJ2ayo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518220</guid></item><item><title>23.

Thus, before the spacecraft runs out of fuel, they have moved it away from L2 into its final graveyard  orbit.It is not capable of performing the science for which it was designed in its graveyard orbit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also overwrote the EEPROM of the satellite computer before shutting it, because apparently they were concerned that the satellite would reawake, because it has multiple autonomous recovery modes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great images from the project here:https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485514</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in the ICU monitoring field, on the R&amp;D team of a company with live systems at dozens of hospitals and multiple FDA approvals. We use extended Kalman filters (i.e. non-blackbox "ML") to estimate certain lab values of patients that are highly indicative of them crashing, based on live data from whatever set of monitors they're hooked up to - and it's highly robust.What the authors of this paper are doing is throwing stuff at the wall to see if it works, and publishing results. That's not necessarily a bad thing at all, but I say this to underline that their results are not at all reflective of SOTA capabilities, and they're not doing much exploration of prior art.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I missing something or is this just "We built models that are bad"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For IHM prediction, LSTM models and transformer models were trained for 100 epochs using the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets separately.I might be blind, but I don't see any mention of loss. Did they stop at 100 because it was a nice round number or because it was a good place to stop?The LSTM model they used had 7k trainable parameters, the CW-LSTM model 153k while the transformer model had 800k parameters (300k trainable parameters and 600k optimizer parameters as they say).I don't follow the field close enough, but is it reasonable these models all converged at the same time, given the large difference in size?They mention the transformer model outperforming the LSTMs, but I wonder if it could have done a lot better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482792</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The content from the link discusses a security vulnerability related to the "PyYAML" library, specifically a potential issue with untrusted YAML loading that could lead to arbitrary code execution. The article highlights the implications of this vulnerability and emphasizes the importance of using safer alternatives when dealing with untrusted data. It also includes recommendations for developers to ensure they are mitigating risks associated with this library, such as using the `safe_load` method instead of the standard loader. Overall, the focus is on raising awareness about secure coding practices in the context of YAML processing in Python applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Important caveat: this is not itself a vulnerability; you still need a kernel `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` vulnerability if you want to actually do something evil.(I also expect that if you're already in a restricted AA profile it's not easy to switch to a less-restrictive one, but I think a lot of security tools are bad at thinking about multi-process interpreters)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, entirely, AppArmor profiles for shipped executables allow escape from privileged environments...Without that additional AppArmor 'blessing', wouldn't the standard Linux privileges / container groups prevent this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unprivileged user namespaces are not a security vulnerability. Ubuntu's short-sighted and reactionary decision to ban them makes systems less, not more, secure overall, since with this capability gone, it makes it that much harder for a well-behaved unprivileged program to set up a userspace sandbox. If the kernel has vulnerabilities, fix them. Don't just randomly break useful features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517734</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Thesis: We should create a distro of Linux that runs Windows binaries by default via Wine.On Debian you're one package away:    sudo apt install wine-binfmt

Otherwise you're still pretty close:    echo 'none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0' &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
    mount -a
    echo ':DOSWin:M::MZ::/usr/bin/wine:' &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think a new distro is needed. Most commonly used windows apps can be made to work through wine, but the hacks used to make one app work can break others and vice versa. Similarly, everyone needs to play around with settings individually to get things to work. What works on one person's machine might not work on another's, because there's no consistency in, effectively, configuration.The simplest solution, to me, is to just distribute containers (or some other sandbox) with wine in it, and the necessary shenanigans to get the windows program (just the one) working in the container, and just distribute that. Everyone gets the same artifact, and it always works. No more dicking around with wine settings, because it's baked in for whatever the software is.Yes, this is tremendously space inefficient, so the next step would be a way of slimming wine down for container usage.The only real barrier to this system is licensing and software anti patterns. You might have to do some dark magic to install the software in the container in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First-class support for Windows applications might just become doable, if Wine continues to progress and Win32 doesn't accelerate. There were a handful of quality of life improvements in previous Windows releases, but the biggest Win32 changes feel like they happened quite a while ago by now, and for good reason: Win32 is stable and mature. It's still a moving target, but not by nearly as much, and even if Microsoft wanted to move it for the sake of moving it, they might find more resistance than they can completely overcome. For now, I think Wine is still not good enough to recommend people just use for everything, though. It's incredible, but incredible doesn't make Photoshop install.However, I also think that we could "solve" a lot of the compatibility problems.There are tons of old Linux binaries that don't work anymore. But... They could. A lot of old binaries, surely the vast majority, could absolutely run on a modern kernel. The problem is the userspace. The binaries themselves contain oodles of information that could be used to figure out what they need to run, it's just that there's nothing in place to try to make sure that stuff is available.I really believe we could make it possible for a distro, out of the box, to make old binaries "just work", double-click and run. Want to install an old game from an .rpm or .deb you have? The system could identify what base OS that is and install it into it's own chroot with its dependencies, then create desktop icons for it. Execution failures? Missing libraries? Xlib errors? Let's have a graphical error message with actionable help.Well, it could be done, anyway. If you wanted to follow the spirit of Windows here, it would be the right thing to do, and it'd help users who found a thing that says it supports "Linux" run that thing the way they would hope and expect it to run. Will it actually happen? Not unless someone makes it happen, and convinces distros, desktops and all other stakeholders it's worth shipping, then maintains and improves it going forward. It's a bit depressing when you realize that the technical part of implementing this is basically the least challenging part, at least for a proof of concept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518917</guid></item><item><title>28.

But definitely the release of ARC2 and image outputs from 4o got me thinking about the JEPA family too.I don't know if it's right (and I'm sure JEPA has lots of performance issues) but seems good to have a fully latent space representation, ideally across all modalities, so that the concept "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" becoming image/audio/text is a choice of decoder rather than dedicated token ranges being chosen even before the actual creation process in the model begins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GPTs are in the “exploit” phase of the “explore-exploit” trade-off.JEPA is still in the explore phase, it’s good to read the paper and have an understanding of the architecture to gain an alternative perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512657</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GL.iNet is a popular brand, though I can't find a Wikipedia page for it.https://www.gl-inet.com/about-us/ says:&gt; GL Tech (HK) Ltd: #601, 5W, Hong Kong Science Park, N.T. Hong Kong&gt; GL Intelligence, Inc.: 10400 Eaton Place, Suite 215, Fairfax, VA 22030I'm a little curious about this.  One of the reasons that some people run OpenWrt is for improved security.  In the general security space, a Shenzen company isn't the most usual choice of vendor for Western countries.  Also, the company having the US subsidiary/office/unit based in Virginia, and with "intelligence" in the name, hits a somewhat odd note.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome! I've been using OpenWRT for more than a decade, and I  think it's great that they're designing their own hardware now.I'm on a GL.iNet MT-6000 right now, and it's a great router. The stock firmware is based on openwrt, and they make it very easy to upgrade to an official openwrt release. I bought it before the OpenWRT One became available, but I probably would have gone with it anyways because it has two 2.5gb ports whereas the OpenWRT One only has a single 2.5gb port. I'm on 1gb internet right now, so that would be fine for the moment, my ISP has already been advertising 2gb service coming soon, and I'd like to upgrade once it's available.It looks like the MT7988 chip they chose for the OpenWRT Two supports either two 10gb ports or one 10gb and a bunch of other ports, so I think they made the right call. It should be capable of handling up to 5gb internet service, so it'd be a better fit for someone like me.I imagine it'll also be one of the first and likely best OpenWRT devices to support Wi-Fi 7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a reasonable scenario where enough people vote "no" here? It seems unlikely, so a nuanced discussion where pros and cons are considered seems more productive. Seems like a yes/no vote makes more sense if there is actual contention or disagreement among internal factions.If you vote no, you'll basically be seen as the  stickler person without a good reason.18 people are missing (abstained?), so could that be interpreted as an ambiguous "no"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512495</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes but they make a lot of fuzzy decisions, so they are better compared with e.g. alchemists or deep learning researchers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two overlooked aspect of the research:First, an object of the research is pre-human ancestors' tool use:&gt; Physical evidence of early hominin perishable tools is scarce. However, it is reasonable to assume the mechanical constraints surrounding tool use and manufacture have remained somewhat constant. Using a functional framework to understand the technical capabilities of extant hominoid tool users presents a novel approach to predict the perishable tool-using capabilities of our earliest relatives.Note that the Paleolithic, the first period of stone tools, started ~2.58 - 3.3 mya (million years ago); stone can be durable since X mya and we have lots of evidence of that. But our evolutionary line split from the chimps' line ~7 mya (though remember the 7 mya shared ancestor was not a chimpanzee; they evolved too). Before the Paleolithic, and even after it began, our ancestors at times likely used tools made from perishable materials  - I cooked dinner with a wooden spoon, myself.Also, there's the question of culture - something once thought unique to humans:&gt; Our findings provide insights into the technical skills associated with perishable artefact-making and raise questions about how this knowledge is learnt and culturally transmitted.There are two ways to pass down traits: genetics, and culture. If you think culture is somehow weaker or secondary, look at the traditions or look at languages that have lasted thousands of years with no genetic basis. An advantage of the cultural method is flexibility - it can be changed today; biological evolution takes awhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this would be more relatable, like, "chimpanzee
engineers found pretending to managers about estimates, chimpanzee managers found pretending to listen".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43471907</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of securely managing passwords and highlights several best practices for creating strong, unique passwords for different accounts. It emphasizes the use of password managers to assist in storing complex passwords securely and the necessity of enabling two-factor authentication for an added layer of security. The author stresses that relying solely on memorization or simple passwords can expose individuals to significant security risks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm also 100% convinced Microsoft will introduce mandatory code signing at some point and make it so that you can only ever install software from Windows Store.They are envious of the Google and Apple walled gardens/cashcows and are now determined to turn Windows into one.Windows is no longer a product for users, the users of Windows are the product for Microsoft to be shoved into the Azure sales funnel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's such an absurd lie. If Microsoft's idea of security is to force its users to authenticate online for a local account, they should never be allowed in the software industry at all. They're needlessly and dramatically increasing the attack surface of one of the most security critical software running on user devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago, I needed to get into safe mode to rescue a laptop that wouldn't boot.Since it uses Windows 11, I originally logged in using my Microsoft Account and a Windows Hello pin.Safe mode doesn't load wifi drivers and the laptop didn't have an ethernet port, so I couldn't log in to my Microsoft Account to get into Windows safe mode. Didn't have a dongle with ethernet port at that time, so I had to backup the drive and reinstall Windows instead.That's why I use Linux these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512660</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Et Tu, Grammarly?" discusses the controversial transition of Grammarly from a grammar checking tool to a more comprehensive writing assistant, including features that promote a specific style of communication and even political correctness. It examines the implications of such a shift, raising concerns about censorship and the potential loss of individual voice in writing. The author expresses frustration with these changes, emphasizing the importance of preserving diverse writing styles and freedom of expression while navigating the evolving landscape of AI tools in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My extension problem story is a bit different. We distribute an extension that makes it easy to switch between proxy servers for geolocation testing.I ran my worst client demo ever a few months ago. It was like our product simply didn’t work. A lot of pulled hair and frustrating debugging later we discovered that a recent update to the 1Password extension broke ours. They were subscribing to an auth event, but not returning, this timed out so our subscriber was never called. So our extension would tell the browser to change proxy servers, then sit ready to provide credentials, but the request would never come. 1Password’s support team was better than grammerly’s, but it’s hard to convince an unknown PM to prioritize something, especially if you’re speaking to them via a support team.We’ve since discovered that there’s some Russian extension you need for government websites that has the same issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're injecting scripts or styles into unknown pages, the least you can do is namespace your variables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its frightening to see how many screenshares and recordings contain that green infestation as default on every website, not just the obvious visual disturbance (am i the only one who thinks the green is ugly and clashes with most websites colors?) that does not seem to bother users but the privacy and obvious attack vectors that come with it. Chrome can enable extensions only when needed why does no one do this? Why is this not the default on every browser?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43514308</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of subtyping in object-oriented programming and how it enhances code clarity and reuse. It explains that subtyping allows for the creation of more specific types from a general base type, facilitating polymorphism. This improves the ability to manage complex systems and makes code more understandable. The piece also highlights the benefits of subtyping in facilitating better software design and maintenance, ultimately leading to more robust and adaptable applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If a function accepts a value that can be String or null, it is ok to pass it a value that is guaranteed to be a String and not null. Or in other words, String is a subtype of String?!That's... not true? The language can just have an implicit conversion rule for convenience.&gt; properties like nullability that don’t affect memory layoutThat's not true either? It might not affect memory layout because all your objects are boxed or you have niche value optimisation you can use to tag nulls, but make an unboxed integer nullable and you'll definitely see your memory layout be affected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; existing programming languages have little or no subtyping [...] If you remember the fad for Object Oriented ProgrammingI was under the impression that even today, most code is written in an object-oriented style (or at least, written in languages that support OOP). Therefore, most languages support subtyping via inheritance. Is that not true?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like "Why You Need Algebraic Subtyping" might be a better title for this post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485373</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "geeks' naivety," exploring how tech enthusiasts often approach complex societal issues with an overly simplistic mindset. It highlights the tendency of some in the tech community to underestimate the social implications of their innovations and the importance of engaging with broader perspectives. The author warns against assuming that technological solutions alone can address deep-rooted problems, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the intersection between technology and society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naivety has layers. You either die a normie who doesn't care about privacy, or you live long enough to become a schizo who knows how bad things really are. Try bringing up at the dinner table the NSA dragnet or always-on backdoors embedded in consumer routers and CPUs.Everything is tracked, everything is logged, its been this way for a long time and there's nothing you can do about it. You have zero privacy in the internet and you're an idiot if you think otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google has been around since 1998 with people putting every dark secret and worry into search queries. Not once has someones searches been leaked by employees, despite highly political people working at these companies with a lot to gain by leaking to a journalist or similar.Likewise with private messages on Facebook, order history on Amazon.Big Tech has way more to lose than the small "privacy focused" alternatives, and clearly for them to go this long with this many employees its through design not luck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of discussion here about the motivation of companies and what they can share or remain private in relation to their objectives and making a profit. But, I think to provide a much better argument is what are their actual motivations to have privacy in all of the systems to begin with.Apple and Amazon will at minimum compromise your privacy to improve their products. And since they have no extra motivation since they don't make more or less money (because Siri and Alexa are loss leaders) they will have no extra considerations of privacy regardless.Comparing Signal to protonmail is a much more interesting problem and you can go on to what has been subpoena from Signal and protonmail. Since there was one actually disclosed we can see the information (or really lack of) that was given by Signal [1] . We have a statement by proton mail on what can be subpoena [2] but there have been arguments against it.[1] https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection.You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the "Router" field, that's how it works.Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process.As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work.It's a fairly clever setup.If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CarPlay sends a H264/5 video stream from the iPhone to the car's head unit, and receives touchscreen, knob, etc. input in the other direction (afaik). I'm not sure if the video is encrypted, but it seem rather unlikely that the dongle could exfiltrate such an amount of data undetected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something that might be useful to know with these devices is that they're quite liable to bricking during updates.If you do install an update, make sure you reopen its' web portal and confirm the version number is different to what it was before. If it hasn't changed from before, you'll have to wait a while as its still flushing bytes to its flash memory, and if you accidentally trigger an update again here, you'll be left with a brick (speaking from experience).Depending on the device you bought, you might also be able to flash custom firmware on it: https://github.com/ludwig-v/wireless-carplay-dongle-reverse-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470337</guid></item><item><title>39.

John is using language in a manipulative way. By moving the word "enemy" into a context where it is not justified (is it really war, rather than typical negotiations?), he aims to create a dramatic perspective on a thing that is not obviously dramatic. Drama is the basis of the argument. The cases he brings up do not seem to justify the conclusive dramatic language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a US scientist and the use of minimalist phone and a laptop is something I'm planning for all my travel.This is for the simple reason that I have determined, based on a large body of cases that are accumulating at a disturbing rate, that the current US administration considers themselves "above the law". Furthermore, the administration has shown that they are eager to carry out actions that violate due process and freedom of speech against anyone they perceive as opposing their policies/views.EDIT: I'm happy to document such cases for those who have not been paying attention, but I also encourage those who are doubtful to simply search the many examples that have been posted here on HN (unfortunately, many flagged in an attempt to suppress discussion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the important things to watch for is the linkup of the papers please people with the internet scanners. Right now they seem to be limited to seizing your personal effects, but that is a matter of coordination between departments of the government. If there are laws against it, they are adjacent to other laws which were ignored even in previous years.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of romance scams that exploit individuals through online dating platforms, specifically highlighting the use of incognito mode to ensconce scammers in anonymity. It explains how scammers create fake profiles to build emotional connections and ultimately manipulate victims for financial gain. The piece underscores the dangers of sharing personal information online and emphasizes the need for vigilance and education about these deceptive practices to protect oneself from falling victim to such schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I struggled to find the source the fact that $1T is lost to scammers. From the FBI internet crime report in 2023 Americans lost about 12.5 Billion dollars [0]. That is far from 1T$.Another source reports cost if cybercrime is reported to reach 9.5T$ in 2024 but again no source provided for that number [1][0] https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3Report.pdf#...[1] https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/2023-official-cyb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My elderly mother has been scammed twice (that I know of).  She fell for one of those "Your computer has been hacked" popup windows a few years ago.  Which led to her buying a "protection" service that installed malware on her machine.  Every couple of months she'd have an "issue" and have to shell out more money to fix it.  She's been using computers since the 80's (Apple ][e) but still is utterly clueless on how to operate a computer.  I had her take her computer to a computer shop to have the OS re-installed but he somehow kinda botched it.  Fortunately I was able to later re-install Windows myself and she hasn't had an issue since.  I've strongly warned her about scammers and now when she doesn't respond to an obvious scammer email she's pleased with herself.  Old people really do become children again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not going to read the "article" because it is a transcript and looks a bit rambly and I don't expect it to be talking about anything interesting. But just going to the headline here; consider the base rate. North America has huge per-capita wealth (by a bit of a margin over most other large players). It is expected that scammers would target them and make the most profit there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513850</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Snakes in a Pane" discusses the unexpected challenges faced by a character dealing with a complicated situation involving deception and mistrust. It explores themes of betrayal, anxiety, and the fear of the unknown, using the metaphor of snakes to symbolize hidden dangers and surprises in life. The narrative emphasizes the importance of facing one’s fears and navigating tricky circumstances with resilience, ultimately encouraging readers to confront their own "snakes" rather than avoiding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a concerning trend in the decline of cash usage in the UK, linking it to a significant drop in the number of NHS surgeries for children who swallow foreign objects. Health experts suggest that the reduced number of surgeries may be partly attributed to the fact that parents are less likely to seek medical help due to payment methods and the challenges they face during emergencies. The article highlights the implications of this shift away from cash for healthcare access, particularly for urgent care situations involving children.&lt;/p&gt;

You have to be careful not to leave them around. We got a gumball machine that dispenses M&amp;Ms, so at least now they think of coins as “something I should spend” instead of “something I should chew on”.Coins aren’t that toxic… most of the time. An even worse threat is button and coin cell batteries. Those should really leave any parent worried. When disposing of them, they need to be wrapped up in something big enough they can’t be swallowed and then taped up so the coin can’t get out. Lately I’ve been disposing of them in a sharps container I have for getting rid of Stanley knife razor blades, another decent choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s an unnecessarily confusing headline.“Decline of cash credited” makes me think of “cash credited” in accounting.The actual headline is “Decline of cash credited for drop in NHS surgery for children swallowing objects” … which doesn’t provide the context necessary to correct this misunderstanding until after you figure you what “NHS surgery” is.It’s a really bad sentence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518251</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Madison Square Garden's controversial use of facial recognition technology to identify and ban fans from attending events, particularly those who have been vocal critics of the venue's management, specifically James Dolan. This policy has raised concerns about privacy and the ethical implications of surveillance in public spaces, as well as the potential for misuse of such technology. Critics argue that it undermines the experience of attending live events and highlights broader issues regarding how venues manage dissent and customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If they pulled Miller out of the line and only then checked his photo ID, and the allegation is they used facial recognition to trigger this, then that implies they already had his biometrics in their database.The legal disclaimer shown at the venue implies that the biometrics are collected (and “retained, stored, and converted”) at the venue.  That’s clearly only half of the story.  They must also be collecting (and retaining, storing, and converting) information about anyone using sources outside the venue.The implication from chronology of the story is that MSG must have done something like googled Miller, found his LinkedIn bio-pic, and put that in their “safety and security” database?I think we can conclude therefore that the disclaimer sign is not a quasi-legal disclaimer to let the venue record your face, but in fact a canard to divert your attention from the fact that they have already created records linking your face to your name — records created without your consent and without letting you know they did it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Frank Miller Jr. made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature,” Mikyl Cordova, executive vice president of communications and marketing for the company, said in an emailed statement.If he made threats, what were the threats?If he didn't make threats, does this written statement, from a communications executive, to a journalist, intended for news publication, constitute libel?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His behavior was disrespectful and disruptive and in violation of our code of conduct.Certainly not the first time a vague and imposing "code of conduct" has caused trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43511340</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of a new law in the UK that allows police to stop and search individuals without reasonable suspicion in certain areas. This measure is aimed at addressing rising violent crime rates and is controversial due to concerns about potential racial profiling and the erosion of civil liberties. Supporters argue that it will help reduce crime and keep communities safe, while critics warn it may disproportionately affect minority groups and lead to mistrust in police. The debate continues as various stakeholders weigh the effectiveness and implications of this law on public safety and community relations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article does not make it clear why they think the portrait depicts Shakespeare. I guess you have to watch the tv show for that information?It talks about comparison to other portraits of Shakespeare, but as far as I know there are no depictions of Shakespeare confirmed to have been made in his lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never been a fan of classic portraits of people, but by way of watching a lot of Baumgartner restoration videos it's become an interest.A lot apparently goes into establishing the authenticity of portraits. As a conservator, he does a lot of work in the background that isn't always conveyed in the videos.Sometimes the outcome of his restoration efforts is to communicate to the client that the painting is either a copy, or may have history but the subject isn't who they thought it was.No actual comment on this particular story, but the little bit I've learned of the art community is that they put a huge amount of effort into confirming provenance. The history of the painting.So if a lot of experts in the field are raising doubts, it's probably worth examining their statements.Like archaeologists, most want to make a major find. It's career making. But that also requires being highly sceptical of new claims.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a starting place to help in determining any and all of these sorts of paintings, would be a complete catelog of evererything in existence related including tools, note books,church records,genetic evidence,clothing,
all of it.
And have at it, a grand and worthy quest, and as has happened many times, the tinyest details can make or break a theory, and it is the fleshing out of those minutia that brings the past back to life, and that imediatecy is what facinates people 
 And to think of the lovely absurdity of this bloke, growing up, with the bard,himeself, looming

I wonder what would happen if you submit it to the Android VDP as a permission bypass.There’s also this SO question by the author about the bypass: https://stackoverflow.com/q/79527331&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still, will never understand the need for native "Apps". To this day, I have never seen an "App" that couldn't simply have been a website/webapp. Most of them would likely be improved by being a webapp.The only benefits I can see of "Apps", are the developer get's access to private information they really don't need.Yeah, they get to be on the "App Store". But the "App Store" is a totally unnecessary concept introduced by Apple/Google so they could scrape a huge percentage in sales.Web browsers have good (not perfect) sandboxing, costs no fees to "submit" and are accessible to everyone on every phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's why I like hacker news.I found this article yesterday and posted it on reddit android, here : https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1jmwg4w/everyone_k...0 upvote, comment filled with what is either depressed sad people or just bots.Here it's top 2...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and highlights the challenges and opportunities within the industry as governments and consumers shift towards cleaner transportation options. It examines the advancements in battery technology, the impact of charging infrastructure, and the importance of policy support in accelerating EV adoption.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I initially dismissed it as the same category of stupid as anti-vax beliefs, but it turns out that there are a decent amount of good studies showing a link between fluoride in water and (slightly) lower IQ when pregnant mothers ingest the fluoride. Note that there is no significant effect after birth.The idea is to remove fluoride from water and advise pregnant women to use fluoride-free toothpaste.Everyone else can get enough fluoride from modern toothpastes, or regular dentist treatments.The logic is that fluoride in tap water made sense in the era before toothpaste had it, but now it is “overmedicating” a vulnerable fraction of the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s going to go poorly. A Canadian city removed fluoride from water in 2011 and reversed that decision 10 years later. There’s hard data on the effects and they’re not good [0].[0] https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5224138/calgary-removed...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is trivial today to get whatever level of fluoride is recommended for dental health, via toothpaste.  So there is no compelling need to fluoridate as there exist viable alternatives to achieve the same  that fluoridation is for any other purpose than dental health.In the USA, dental care is not covered by public insurance, and is an optional add-on to insurance through one’s employer.So without addressing at all whether fluoridation is effective or safe, there doesn’t seem to be any compelling need to fluoridate public water, and there’s no economic down side for the public if governments choose not to do so.Given this, why not just leave people alone to make their own choices?  If the citizens in a city or state want to fluoridate the public water supply, then do so; if they choose not to, then leave them alone.  It’s a free country and voters are grownups; let them choose for themselves.If you live in a place that chooses the choice you dislike but for some reason fluoridated public water supply is a critical issue for you, either campaign to change it or vote with your feet.This issue just doesn’t seem important enough to me to spend any effort arguing either way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517833</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the troubling case of a computer scientist who became uncontactable following an FBI raid and subsequent removal of references to their work from a university website. The situation raises questions about academic freedom, the rights of researchers, and the implications of federal investigations on academic careers. It highlights concerns regarding transparency and the potential chilling effects on research in sensitive areas due to law enforcement actions. The scientist's silence and the lack of official information contribute to growing speculation and concern within the academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue95 is a graphical user interface designed to mimic the look and feel of Windows 95, created for modern operating systems. The project is open-source and allows users to enjoy a retro computing experience with familiar icons, sounds, and layouts from the classic Windows operating system. It serves as a nostalgic tool for enthusiasts who appreciate vintage computing culture, and provides installation instructions and customization options for users interested in exploring this unique interface.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks nice and easy to use.My hypothesis is today's "modern" OS user interfaces are objectively worse from a usability perspective, obfuscating key functionality behind layers of confusing menus.It reminds me of these "OS popularity since the 70s" time lapse views:https://youtube.com/watch?v=cTKhqtll5cQThe dominance of Windows is crazy, even today, Mac desktops and laptops are comparatively niche&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's just the chicago theme I'va had for years now on my XFCE, I think it's a bit lame to steal that theme (not from Microsoft but the maker of that xfce theme), put it in a repository, give it a different name, and pose it as your own work?The repo literally adds nothing, just a name change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lately I've been strongly considering helping migrate my parents to Linux. Their needs are primarily web-based with some basic productivity tools mixed in, and Windows has just been getting more and more hostile. On top of this, they're at an age where they're now more susceptible than ever to various scams/attacks, and shutting down an entire category of problems by removing Windows from the picture is increasingly attractive.I had forgotten that Chicago95 exists, but this might be exactly the right thing. They'd immediately find it familiar, and while the theme isn't the whole story, this would go a long way in easing the transition I think.I miss this era of computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43524937</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to create self-contained Python scripts using the `uvicorn` server, highlighting the benefits of deploying lightweight, executable scripts that do not require a full server setup. It provides step-by-step instructions for packaging a Python application with its dependencies, using tools like `pyinstaller` to compile the script into a standalone executable. The post emphasizes the advantages of portability and ease of distribution for development and deployment, making it easier for users to run Python applications without needing to install Python or additional libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has come up a LOT on HN in the past few months, some other recent examples:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43500124https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42463975I like uv and all, but I take exception to the "self-contained" claim in two regards:1) The script requires uv to already be installed. Arguably you could make it a shell script that checks if uv is already installed and then installs it via curlpipe if not... but that's quite a bit of extra boilerplate and the curlpipe pattern is already pretty gross on its own.2) Auto-creating a venv somewhere in your home directory is not really self-contained. If you run the script as a one-off and then delete it, that venv is still there, taking up space. I can't find any assertion in the uv docs that these temporary virtual environments are ever automatically cleaned up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My pet peeve (in general, not specific to UV, which I genuinely appreciate) is using comment sections for controlling code execution.Using comments for linters and developer notes is perfectly acceptable. However, for configuration or execution-related data, a far superior pattern would be something like:  UV_ENV = {
    "dependencies": { "requests":  "2.32.3", "pandas": "2.2.3" }
  }


This approach has clear advantages:- It's valid Python syntax.- It utilizes standard, easily-parsable data structures rather than ad-hoc comment parsing. It makes creation and validation smooth.- Crucially, it adheres to a core principle: if you remove all comments from your code, it should still execute identically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do the same with Nix, the shebang line looks like this:    #! nix-shell -i python3 -p "python312.withPackages (pkgs: [ pkgs.boto3 pkgs.click ])"

With this, the only requirement is Nix on the system, you don't even need Python to be installed!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519669</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "upcast," which refers to a method of referring to a type that is more general or a parent class in programming. It highlights the importance of being able to use upcasting effectively within object-oriented programming languages to facilitate polymorphism and code reusability. The author outlines practical examples and scenarios that illustrate the benefits and applications of upcasting in software development, ultimately emphasizing how it can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Even though DebugAny inherits from AnyI'm going to push back against this terminology for the sake of people who don't know Rust and are coming from traditional OO languages.Rust traits don't "inherit" from other traits, they "require" other traits.So if I have two traits, where one requires the other:    trait Foo {}

    trait Bar: Foo {}

That doesn't add Foo's methods to Bar's list of methods, like you might expect from the term "inheritance".Instead, it just means that it's not possible to implement Bar for a type unless Foo is also separately implemented for that type.Despite this it's still accurate to say that this enables a supertype/subtype relationship in certain contexts, but be careful because Rust isn't a traditionally OO language, so that may not always be the most useful framing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The important change here appears to be that the internal representation of a vtable is now guaranteed to have its supertraits laid out in some predictable prefix form to its own methods.EDIT: or if this is not possible, a pointer to the appropriate vtable is included. I assume this must be for diamond trait inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This example shows how it works for one trait, Debug, but what if you have a type that (might) implement multiple traits A, B, and/or C?  It isn't clear to me if that is possible,  unless the type implements all of those traits.  What I'd like to do is have some base trait object and query it to see if it supports other interfaces, but also not have to have stub "I don't actually implement this" trait impls for the unsupported ones.  A bit like how I might use dynamic_cast in c++.(I believe I understand that in rust this has not historically been possible because rust doesn't have inheritance, so, there can be only one vtable for a type, rather than an chain like you might have in c++.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523238</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't help but thinking how handy PowerShell is out of the box for tasks like this.Translating the examples from the ReadMe, having read the file with:  $medias = Get-Content .\medias.csv | ConvertFrom-Csv

Previewing the file in the terminal  xan view medias.csv
  $medias | Format-Table

Reading a flattened representation of the first row  xan flatten -c medias.csv
  $medias | Format-List

Searching for rows  xan search -s outreach internationale medias.csv | xan view
  $medias | Where-Object { $_.outreach -eq "internationale" } | Format-Table

Selecting some columns  xan select foundation_year,name medias.csv | xan view
  $medias | Select-Object -Property foundation_year, name | Format-Table

Sorting the file  xan sort -s foundation_year medias.csv | xan view -s name,foundation_year
  $medias | Sort-Object -Property foundation_year | Select-Object -Property name, foundation_year | Format-Table

Deduplicating the file on some column  # Some medias of our corpus have the same ids on mediacloud.org
  xan dedup -s mediacloud_ids medias.csv | xan count &amp;&amp; xan count medias.csv
  $medias | Select-Object -ExpandProperty mediacloud_ids -Unique | Measure-Object; $medias | Measure-Object -Property mediacloud_ids

Computing frequency tables  xan frequency -s edito medias.csv | xan view
  $medias | Group-Object -Property edito | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending

It's probably orders of magnitude slower, and of course, plotting graphs and so on gets tricky. But for the simple type of analysis I typically do, it's fast enough, I don't need to learn an extra tool, and the auto-completion of column/property names is very convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer to use clickhouse-local for all my CSV needs as I don't need to learn a new language (or cli flags) and can just leverage SQL.    clickhouse local --file medias.csv --query "SELECT edito, count() AS count from table group by all order by count FORMAT PrettyCompact"

   ┌─edito──────┬─count─┐

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the concept of "RR Everywhere," which focuses on implementing the 'Request-Replay' (RR) paradigm in distributed systems to enhance performance and fault tolerance. It discusses the advantages of RR, such as improved efficiency in resource usage and easier debugging. Additionally, it details potential challenges in establishing RR, including complexities in state management and synchronization. The author emphasizes the importance of practical applications and provides insights into how RR can be effectively integrated into various systems and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

The Software Counters mode rr wiki has more details in case you're curious about some more of the internals.You should move that to the top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have tried SO hard to get rr to work for me, including buying a separate pc just to use it...but it just consistently fails so I've basically abandoned it. Something like this would absolutely be a godsend. Just getting something consistently working with Ubuntu is amazing. Does this approach make working in something like WSL viable?I would love if this were upstreamed. Is there a github issue where you discuss the possibility of this with the rr devs? That might be something to add to your readme for everyone else who wants to follow along. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. It’s difficult to praise rr too much, and it just keeps getting better. If you’re not using it, you’re missing out on a superpower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43481652</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of talk about how LLMs will disrupt software development and office work and whatnot, but there is one thing that they are massively disrupting right now, and that is education. I've witnessed this with a group of CS master students recently, and they have let their programming skills atrophy to barely imaginable levels. LLMs have the twin effect of raising the bar for what even a barely viable junior developer has to live up to, while simultaneously lowering their actual skills. There is a generation of completely unemployable "graduates" in the pipeline.The article mentions that most students are only in it for the diploma anyway, but somehow most people are yet to realize that those diplomas will soon be toilet paper, precisely because they no longer require any actual effort to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can bear with me while i attempt a synthesis here, I think this one line captures basically the entire dynamic, but the author seems to seriously underweight its explanatory value.&gt; The average student has seen college as basically transactional for as long as I’ve been doing thisIt is a transaction. The number of students there because they want to learn a subject rounds to zero. A college degree (especially from good old State U) serves first and foremost as a white-collar job permit. The students (or their parents/lender/state) are purchasing the permit from the institution. They are the customer. Anything you, the employee, ask of them beyond the minimum to hold up the fig leaf is a waste of the students' time (from their perspective) and a violation of the implied terms of this transaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What has changed exactly? Chronic absenteeism. As a friend in Sociology put it, “Attendance is a HUGE problem—many just treat class as optional.” Last semester across all sections, my average student missed two weeks of class.My brother and I graduated from university a little over 4 years ago and we were both top students (he studied music and I studied applied math). There were classes where he and I (without exaggeration) skipped more than 90% of the lectures.I understand that some professors view this as disrepsectful, but when your lectures consist of simply reading off the lecture notes that you're going to upload online anyway, lectures become a waste of time that could be better spent with more studying on our own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43522966</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The document consists of four lectures given by Mads Tofte that focus on programming language semantics, particularly the formal underpinnings of functional programming. It covers key concepts such as type systems, evaluation strategies, and the relationship between programming languages and mathematical logic. Tofte discusses various semantic models, including operational and denotational semantics, providing insights and examples about how these models can be applied to understand and reason about programming languages. The overall aim is to deepen comprehension of how formal semantics can enhance programming language design and improve software reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses tail call recursion in Java using the ASM library to optimize recursion by reusing the current stack frame for certain calls, thus avoiding stack overflow errors associated with deep recursion. It explains the concept of tail calls, the limitations of Java's default stack behavior, and provides examples of implementing tail call optimization with ASM, showcasing how this technique can improve performance in recursive algorithms. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding both recursion and the underlying mechanisms of the Java runtime for effective programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's been a long time since I've messed with Java bytecode [1], but shouldn't the private method call use INVOKESPECIAL?In general I don't think you can do this to INVOKEVIRTUAL (or INVOKEINTERFACE) as it covers cases where your target is not statically resolved (virtual/interface calls). This transformation should be limited to INVOKESTATIC and INVOKESPECIAL.You also need lots more checks to make sure you can apply the transformations, like ensure the call site is not covered by try block.1: https://jauvm.blogspot.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the "lambda the ultimate" papers and the birth of scheme was a loong time ago, so it grates on my ears to hear this topic presented as "an optimization". Yes, it is sometimes an optimization a compiler can make, but the idea is much better presented as a useful semantic of a language.in the same way that passing parameters to a subfunction "creates" a special set of local variables for the subfunction, the tail recursion semantic updates this set of local variables in an especially clean way for loop semantics, allowing "simultaneous assignment" from old values to new ones.(yes, it would be confusing with side effected C/C++ operators like ++ because then you'd need to know order of evaluation or know not to do that, but those are already issues in those languages quite apart from tail recursion)because it's the way I learned it, I tend to call the semantic "tail recursion" and the optimization "tail call elimination", but since other people don't do the same it's somewhat pointless; but I do like to crusade for awareness of the semantic beyond the optimization. If it's an optimization, you can't rely on it because you could blow the stack on large loops. If it's a semantic, you can rely on it.(the semantic is not entirely "clean" either. it's a bit of a subtle point that you need to return straightaway the return value of the tail call or it's not a tail call. fibonacci is the sum of the current with the next so it's not a tail call unless you somewhat carefully arrange the values you pass/keep around. also worth pointing out that all "tail calls" are up for consideration, not just recursive ones)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every compiler should recognize and optimize for tail recursion. It's not any harder than most other optimizations, and some algorithms are far better expressed recursively.Why is this not done?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523741</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Towards Fearless SIMD" discusses advancements and best practices in the use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) programming to enhance performance in software development. It emphasizes overcoming common challenges associated with SIMD, such as code complexity and debugging difficulties, and advocates for strategies that enhance programmer productivity and confidence. The author shares insights into effective coding techniques, tools, and frameworks that can aid developers in leveraging SIMD more effectively while ensuring maintainability and reducing errors in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Rust feels like a Python developer’s idea of a high-performance computing language. It’s a great language for many kinds of applications — just not when you need to squeeze out every bit of performance from advanced hardware.Even before getting into SIMD, try using Rust for concurrent, succinct, or external-memory data structures. It quickly becomes clear where the friction is.Cargo is fantastic — clean, ergonomic, and a joy compared to many toolchains. But it’s much easier to keep things simple when you don’t have to support dozens of AVX-512 variants, AMX, SME, different CUDA generations, ROCm, or any of the other modern hardware capabilities.Standardising SIMD in the standard library — in Rust or C++ — has always been a questionable idea. Most of these APIs cater to operations that compilers already auto-vectorize reasonably well, and they barely touch the recent capabilities of SIMD. Just consider how hard it is to build any meaningful abstraction over the predicate/register models across AVX-512, SVE, and RVV.RVV aside, this should illustrate the point: https://www.modular.com/blog/understanding-simd-infinite-com...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems rustc nightly does successfully vectorize the first sigmoid example: https://rust.godbolt.org/z/e1WYexqWYAlso there's progress on making safe intrinsics safe: https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/pull/1714&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting! I posted a vector and quaternion lib here a few weeks ago, and got great feedback on the state of SIMD on these things. I since have went on a deep dive, and implemented wrapper types in a similar way to this library. Used macros to keep repetition down. Split into three main sections:  - Floating point primitives. Like this lib. Basically, copied `core::simd`'s API. Will delete this part once core::simd is stable. `f32x8`, `f64x4` types etc, with standard operator overloads, and utility methods like `splat`, `to_array` etc.

  - Vec and Quaternion analogs. Same idea, similar API. Vec3x8, Quaternionx8 etc.

  - Code to convert slices of floating point values, or non-SIMD vectors and quaternions to SIMD ones, including (partial) handling of accessing valid lanes in the last chunk.

I've incorporated these `x8` types into a WIP molecular dynamics application; relatively painless after setting up the infra. Would love to try `Vec3x16` etc, but 512-bit types aren't stable yet. But from Github activity on Rust, it sounds like this is right around the corner!Of note, as others pointed out in the thread here I mentioned, the other vector etc libs are using the AoS approach, where a single f32x4 value etc is used to represent a Vec3 etc. While with this SoA approach, a `Vec3x8` is for performing operations on 8 Vec3s at once.The article had interesting and surprising points on AVX-512 (Needed for f32x16, Vec3x16 etc). Not sure of the implications of exposing this in a public library is, i.e. might be a trap if the user isn't on one of the AMD Zen CPUs mentioned.From a few examples, I seem to get 2-4x speedup from using the x8 intrinsics, over scalar (non-SIMD) operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519823</guid></item><item><title>13.

Cell level simulation is the current bottleneck of the project, why would we not start at the cellular level, and then move up to multicellular organisms? Of course this ultimately leads to the question, can we truly simulate anything if we can’t simulate at the quantum level?(at scale) It would be quite profound to find out that we can fully simulate complex life while abstracting the lower levels, if that were the case, maybe we don’t need them either!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just for everyone here, the code for "building an MCP server", is importing the standard MCP package for Typescript, Python, etc, then writing as little as 10 lines of code to define something is an MCP tool.Basically, it's not rocket science. I also built MCP servers for Mysql, Twilio, Polars, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is wild. Our company has like 10 data scientists writing SQL queries on our DB for business questions. I can deploy pg-mcp for my organization so everyone can use Claude to answer whatever is on their mind? (e.x."show me the top 5 customers by total sales")sidenote: I'm scared of what's going to happen to those roles!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From docker-compose    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

This will cause Docker to expose this to the internet and even helpfully configure an allow rule to the host firewall, at least on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520953</guid></item><item><title>15.

I don't even remember who it was, but to this day feel bad about that.When I got home, my parents said it's no problem, just write a letter explaining what happened and the tooth fairy will understand.  And that worked.Being a deviant, I decided to test it a few days later with another letter in secret, to no avail.  And that was my first inclination this whole thing wasn't real.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it bad that I was immediately jarred by the fact it doesn't use Transport Sans?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a hypothetical debate between two influential figures in science, Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, centering on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. It highlights their differing views on determinism and the nature of reality, showcasing key experiments and theoretical arguments that shaped their famous rivalry. The piece aims to elucidate the impact of their clash on the understanding of physics and the philosophical implications of quantum theory.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here!I started writing this review in 2022, after learning about The Nobel Duel at the Frontiers in Reproduction course (Prof. Stephen Hammes mentioned it to me). At the time, both Schally and Guillemin were still alive! I worked on the review off and on for nearly 3 years. It’s a rather complex story, and I went down a lot of scientific rabbit holes in the process (such as looking into 1960s peptide purification methods).Overall, I think the main lesson I learned is that the rivalry between Schally and Guillemin was avoidable. In other words, their “winner takes all” scientific environment was a necessary component of the rivalry, but by itself it wasn’t sufficient. After all, plenty of other endocrinologists didn’t have massive feuds. The rivalry was really driven by the combination of the scientific environment with the personalities and communication styles of the two men. If Schally and Guillemin had had a candid conversation in 1961 and agreed to work in separate areas (or, less likely, to work as equal partners), the whole feud would have never happened.So today, if you’re feeling like someone isn’t giving you credit for your work, or is being unfair to you, reach out and talk to them before things escalate too far. Of course, this may not work, but it’s better than sending nasty letters (or these days, emails or tweets) back and forth. There will always be competition in science, but duels can be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526396</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the book "Introduction to System Programming for Linux," which serves as a comprehensive guide for those looking to learn system programming using Linux. It covers fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques, including programming in C, using system calls, and understanding file systems and processes. The book aims to equip readers with the skills to write efficient and effective system-level applications on Linux, making it suitable for students, hobbyists, and professionals interested in deepening their understanding of operating systems and low-level programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, this might be perfect for me depending on how the book is written/who the target audience is. $60 for an ebook or $80 for the hard copy is extremely hard to swallow though. I absolutely think a book of that purported length means an author probably put a lot of effort and time into it, and should get compensated. But I'm not familiar with the author at all so you're really buying sight unseen. Has he written anything else? I couldn't find anything with a quick google search.Tangentially related, I was hoping to skim at least the first chapter via the Safari Books Online subscription which afaik had all of the No-Starch books on there (including early access I thought?). But no luck, maybe it'll be added there closer to publication date.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might buy it, but the content already seems to overlap with APUE and/or the Linux Programming Interface&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would be interested in any impressions of this vs. TLPI. Seems like it covers a lot of similar topics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526763</guid></item><item><title>19.

I have a day-job again these days and am persisting what I learnt and sharing it. YouTube is super interesting for me because of the writing, similar for the web app actually because the code isn't that complicated, it's about how do I present it in a way that engaged users, so I am thinking mostly about UX.Actually why not, here is the intro to the first module (100 questions about batteries - ends in a 404):

Both look great!Pagecord is independent, open source and built to last :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m working on https://pikku.devIt’s a TypeScript web framework that’s runtime agnostic, so it can work on serverless and servers (similar to Hono).What’s different is that the focus is primarily just on TypeScript. There’s a CLI tool that inspects all the project code and generates loads of metadata. This can include:• services used• all the HTTP routes, inputs and outputs• OpenAPI documentation• schemas to validate against• typed fetch client• typed WebSocket client
(and more)The design decision was also to make it follow a function-based approach, which means your product code is just functions (that get given all the services required). And you have controllers that wire them up to different transport protocols.This allows interesting design concepts, like writing WebSocket code via serverless format, while allowing it to be deployed via a single process or distributed/serverless. Or progressive enhancement, allowing backend functions to work as HTTP, but also work via Server-Sent Events if a stream is provided.It also allows functions to be called directly from Next.js and full-stack development frameworks without needing to run on a separate server or use their API endpoints (not a huge advocate, but it helps a lot with SSR). Gave a talk about that last week at the Node.js meetup in Berlin.It’s still not 1.0 and there are breaking changes while I include more use cases.Upcoming changes:• use Request and Response objects to make it truly runtime agnostic (currently each adapter has its own thin layer, which tbf is still needed by many that don’t adopt the web spec)• smarter code splitting (this will reduce bundle size by tree-shaking anything not needed on a per-function basis)• queues (one more form of transport)Check it out, would love feedback!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43527452</guid></item><item><title>20.

I wasn't special. They were common. But it's only in the last few years that I've been hearing any concern about the batteries in consumer electronic devices causing aircraft fires.I remember hearing about the ones in hoverboards, and then there was one version of a Samsung device that had problems, but nobody generalized to "all such electronic items must be in the cabin with you, and if you lose track of yours, we're turning the plane around."Did something maybe change about battery chemistry that I don't know about? Or did the design change, such that the batteries aren't protected anymore or have enough more capacity that they've become dangerous?I can't imagine there were actually widespread battery fires for as long as I remember never having heard not to put a battery in checked luggage, so what else changed such that this is such a major issue now when it wasn't before?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a sense of scale, the FAA has been tracking battery related incidents, and you can take a looksie here: https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/resources/lithium_batteries/incid...You can click through to see specific incident summaries. It looks like a significant amount (if not majority) of events are inflight on passenger flights (as opposed to on the ground, tarmac, ground handling, or freight operations). There were 85 total incidents in 2024 (there were some 9 million passenger revenue departures to give another sense of scale).Lost phone is a problem because:* Could be in a place that increases risk of thermal run away to begin with - classic example would be caught in the seat hinge. But even being stuck surrounding by cushioning could increase the risk of overheating* Decreased visibility. The faster you can react (ie, try to dump the thing into a thermal protection bag / get it away from other flammables) the better. If you read the incidents, you'll see time after time the sequence "passenger notified flight attendant, who then placed it in a thermal containment bag, flight completed normally".I could see changes to rules that will begin to prohibit storing batteries in overhead compartments (which aside from the pinch problem, actually has all the same risks of losing a phone). Or perhaps mandatory/routine pre-emptive use of thermal containment bags.The airliners know there's no going back. They must accommodate for batteries, so they'll seek the right balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523765</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an optimization technique for memory comparison in programming, specifically focusing on achieving faster performance than the traditional `memcmp` function. It presents a detailed analysis of various algorithms and methods to improve memory comparison speed, considering factors such as CPU architecture and data alignment. The author shares benchmarks and results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, ultimately aiming to provide developers with insights to enhance their code efficiency when dealing with memory operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more meaningful adventure into microbenchmarking than my last. I look at why we no longer need to P/Invoke memcmp to efficiently compare arrays in C# / .NET.Old stackoverflow answers are a dangerous form of bit-rot. They get picked up by well-meaning developers and LLMs alike and recreated years after they are out of date.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The call to "memcmp" has overhead.  It's an imported function which cannot be inlined, and the marshaller will automatically create pinned GC handles to the memory inside of the arrays as they are passed to the native code.I wonder how it would compare if you passed actual pointers to "memcmp" instead of marshalled arrays.  You'd use "fixed (byte *p = bytes) {" on each array first so that the pinning happens outside of the function call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That's not a super helpful description, but the summary is that it's stack-allocated rather than heap allocated.I’m pretty sure that this is not 100% correct, since one can also use other allocation methods and use a span to represent it. Only with stackalloc will the memory it points to be stackallocated.
What it basically means is that the type is stack allocated, always, but not the memory it points to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43524665</guid></item><item><title>24. 6502 as a Service</title><link>https://www.emulationonline.com/systems/chiplab/6502-lab-available/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the page:"Why do this?Through these reads and writes, we can get glimpses into the internal operation of the chip. Now for the 6502 this is a bit unnecessary, as the internal operations of the chip are already well known.But there are many systems for which the inner workings are not well understood. This chiplab, initially tested with the 6502, should provide a way to learn and build models for these less well understood chips."So, this is pretty much useless at its current state, a placeholder for introspecting more advanced, less known chips in the future. It's pretty much a "because we can" kind of system. And that's a darn fine excuse for building this.Awesome work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the chiplab devboard, it's actually a 65c02. There is a difference.  A lot of differences, actually.https://emulationonline.com/shop/chiplab_6502/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively it's fairly trivial today to run a transistor-level simulation of the 6502 (and a couple of other chips) thanks to the visual6502 reverse engineering effort (the http: link is intended):http://visual6502.org/The netlist is available in their Git repo:https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502...and there's a C port of the netlist simulation code:https://github.com/mist64/perfect6502One advantage of this approach is that you can inspect internal chip state that isn't visible on the output pins, which is very useful for emulator coding....and a couple of years ago I glued all those bits and pieces together for a 'remix' of the original visual6502 web application, using WASM + WebGL + Dear Imgui:https://floooh.github.io/visual6502remix/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520428</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I seem to recall that Vizio was added to my "do not buy" list quite a long time ago, when it turned out they were monitoring your watching habit (https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/7/14527360/vizio-smart-tv-tr...).This seems to be more of the same I guess. Choice text from the link above:Q: Why did I see an ad in Scenic Mode?A: After Scenic Mode launches to full screen, you may see ads. We offer free, scenic content by supporting it with ads. These ads allow VIZIO to offer enhanced, built-in Smart TV features, 300+ live channels, and 15,000+ movies and shows at no cost through WatchFree+ while also helping keep the price of our TVs accessible and competitive.Q: Can I turn Scenic Mode ads off?A: No, not at this time. These ads allow VIZIO to offer enhanced, built-in Smart TV features, 300+ live channels, and 15,000+ movies and shows at no cost through WatchFree+ while also helping keep the price of our TVs accessible and competitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And possibly why this got posted:https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/1jkwcbx/if...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a "smart" TV you'd like to avoid connecting to the internet for reasons like this, you can try disconnecting the wireless module entirely. I had a Sony Bravia TV I didn't trust, and after popping off the back I disconnected the wireless module's ribbon cable. The android-TV OS handled it gracefully, and now I don't have to worry about it attempting to smuggle data through any other WLANs in my apartment building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520074</guid></item><item><title>26.

I havent done the full analysis yet but it‘s already clear that how I think I spend my time is completely different from how I actually spend it.Perception/„feeling“ vs physical reality. The gap is huge.Trivial example, I was convinced that the „time toll“ i have to pay around training was very high. Like I was spending an hour or more just to change into sportswear, shower afterwards, and switch back. This perceived deadweight loss always presented an additional  psychological hurdle to get off my ass and train. Now that I know that it‘s much less than I thought, it‘s gone.Similar for cooking.Like I said, havent done the full analysis yet but I can already highly recommend this practice of recording time at least for a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is a disturbing length of time to spend on LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Mac Users, Qbserve is a pretty good time tracking app that observes you as you use your computer (not just the browser, although it has plugins to identify the sites you browse), and is a good way to start getting a grip on time management, even if it can be a little overwhelming at first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482468</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Sim Daltonism is a color blindness simulator that helps users visualize how colors appear to individuals with different types of color blindness. The application allows users to adjust their display settings to experience color variations as seen by those with conditions like protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. It serves as an educational tool for designers, artists, and anyone interested in understanding color perception differences, ensuring that content is accessible to all audiences. The website provides downloadable versions for various operating systems and highlights its commitment to inclusivity in design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone on Android, this is possible with Simulate Color Space option in the hidden Developer Tools menu. Amusingly it works with the camera too, so you can look around the real world with some sense of what it's like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ll highlight a note from the developer:Sim Daltonism lets you see through the eyes of someone with a color blindness. While the colors shown are a good approximation of what a color blind person would see, you should not expect them to be perfect.Everyone has his own perception of colors that differs slightly from other people, and color blindness are often partial at different degrees. More importantly, cameras do not have the same spectral response as cones in your eyes, so the simulation has to make some assumptions about the frequency composition of the colors.I’m colorblind and haven’t found a simulator that comes close to what it’s like for me. This app doesn’t do it either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential: I've been playing around with the color blindness filters on my iPhone, and the grayscale filter had me thinking for a moment. I've set it to 50%, set up the accessibility shortcut (triple-click on the home button) to toggle it, and found myself using my phone with the filter on basically 99% of the time.It's been a couple of months, and I've noticed that the oversaturated colors were making me slightly agitated, somehow captivating my attention. I sometimes disable the filter to look at a particular picture, or to figure out a detail in some context where the colors are already desaturated. Now my only wish is that it was less linear, maybe like a compressor in audio - maintain detail until it starts approaching the ceiling.It may be a good idea if you'd consider &lt;thelightphone.com&gt; but don't want to switch.Also, Rob Pike: &lt;https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2020/09/color-blindness-i...&gt;Also: &lt;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=plan+9+from+bell+labs+rio&amp;ia=image...&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503670</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces the concepts of functors, applicatives, and monads, which are key abstractions in functional programming, particularly in Haskell. It explains the definitions and roles of each, highlighting how they can be used to manage side effects and enable a more functional programming style. The article provides examples to illustrate these concepts and shows how they relate to each other, emphasizing their importance for structuring code in a clear and predictable manner. The content is aimed at helping readers understand these concepts with a practical approach and encouraging exploration in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason everyone likes to talk about Monads, but really the other types here are just as interesting.  For example, Applicatives are less dynamic than Monads in that you can't `flatMap`/`bind` to decide on the "next" thing to evaluate based on the previous value, but in exchange you get a "static" tree (or graph) of Applicatives that lends itself much better to static analysis, optimization, parallelism, and so on.IIRC Haxl (https://github.com/facebook/Haxl) uses Applicatives to optimize and parallelise remote data fetching, which is hard to do with Monads since those are inherently sequential due to the nature of `flatMap`/`bind`. My own Mill build tool (https://mill-build.org/) uses an applicative structure for your build so we can materialize the entire build graph up front and choose how to parallelize it, query it, or otherwise manipulate it, which is again impossible with Monads since the structure of a Monad computation is only assembled "on the fly" as the individual steps are being evaluated. "Parallel Validation" where you want to aggregate all failures, rather than stopping at the first one, is another common use case (e.g. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/validation or https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/validated.html)Monads seem to have this strange aura around them that attracts certain kinds of personalities, but really they're just one abstraction in a whole toolkit of useful abstractions, and there are many cases where Applicative or some other construct are much more suited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,...I think over the recent years, there's been a rise in typed languages that support functional programming like TypeScript and Rust. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues in the context of AI assistant programming. My guess is that it will become easier for beginners, and the type systems will help to build more robust programs in cooperation with AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, while you may not have appreciated the tone of the Haskell interaction, they are correct in their assessment from a factual perspective. This explanation propagates a number of misunderstandings of the topics well known to be endemic to beginners.In particular, I observed the common belief that functors apply to "containers", when in fact they apply to things that are not containers as well, most notably functions themselves, and it also contains the common belief that a monad has "a" value, rather than any number of values. For instance, the "list monad" will confuse someone operating on this description because when the monad "takes the value out of the list", it actually does it once per value in the list. This is the common "monad as burrito" metaphor, basically, which isn't just bad, but is actually wrong.I'm not limiting it to these errors either, these are just the ones that leap out at me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504175</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The website offers a range of software solutions aimed at enhancing business operations and productivity. It focuses on providing users with high-quality, affordable software options that are designed to streamline various tasks such as project management, accounting, and customer relationship management. The site emphasizes the benefits of choosing their software for businesses looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs, while also highlighting the ease of use and customer support available for each product.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious question, because I'm not sure how I feel about it... should software with a server-side component that needs to keep working be counted as "buy once"? We've seen so many cases of companies going out of business or just deciding that it's no longer worth running these services, and leaving customers with no recourse.An example from this list: LocalCan – https://buyoncesoftware.com/localcan – there's a server-side component (which is why ngrok its competitor is subscription based). If this component disappears the app ceases to function.The flip side to this is that just because an app is entirely local doesn't mean it will work as the software around it gets updated (OSes etc), so if a company decides to stop supporting it, that too is useless in a way. It's not the same because running it on the machine you had when you bought it would still work, but that's not how we use computers in practice. Perhaps this is a different case because many of these "buy once" would charge for a major update like that anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others have also expressed, a lot of the software here doesn't really live up to the what most people mean by 'one-time purchase'.Screen Studio: $9/month vs $220 "one-time purchase" with only one year of support.Sizzy browser: $12/month or $499 one-time purchase.Then you often have a one device limit - I can't be two places at once but I do have both a laptop and desktop machine.Who in their sane mind would choose these? Note that the problem with "one-year of updates" is not that you'd want free access to a newer major version of the app, but a year+ is enough time to have a new OS version make your app unusable or subject to security updates. While companies in the before times would quickly release a patch to keep their old users happy, the one-year term just ensures you'll be left hanging.This is just paying lip service to the idea of a one-time purchase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the items on this list "FridayGPT" doesn't actually do anything unless you plug in an API key from a subscription service. While I understand that technically the app itself is buy-once, it doesn't feel in the spirit of the website, or maybe should be called out on the page, as it could be quite misleading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519998</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the often rigid and overly cautious approach to breaking changes in software development, arguing that the fear surrounding these changes can hinder innovation and progress. It advocates for a more flexible mindset that embraces breaking changes as opportunities for improvement rather than as setbacks. The author emphasizes the importance of clear communication, user education, and gradual transition strategies to effectively manage breaking changes without causing unnecessary disruptions. Overall, the piece encourages a re-evaluation of how developers perceive and handle changes to their software, suggesting that a more open and adaptable attitude could lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post has clickbait vibe unfortunately and is really shallow regarding the analysis of the problem. No, it is not silly how we think about breaking changes. The idea of using some change log isn’t new and there are reasons why it’s not implemented by most build systems.The elephant in the room is changing business requirements. If the change requires the code to consume new parameter without reasonable defaults, no automatic migration would solve it reliably. Let’s say you deal with the money and you introduce currency field. The compiler of the client code cannot just assume the currency, neither it can take it from anywhere by just applying the migration. It is a manual operation to fix the broken code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this proposal ultimately introduces more complexity than it solves. By automatically inserting migrations (whether at compile time or via “migration files”), you end up with a form of hidden control flow that’s arguably worse than traditional overloading or type coercion. In normal type coercion, the transformation is explicit and visible in the language syntax, whereas these “migrations” happen magically behind the scenes.Second, database migrations are notoriously tricky for developers to manage correctly. They often require significant domain knowledge to avoid breaking assumptions further down the line. Applying that paradigm directly to compiler-managed code changes feels like it would amplify the same problems—especially in languages that rely on strong type inference. The slightest mismatch in inferred types could ripple through a large codebase in ways that are far from obvious.While it’s an interesting idea in theory, I think the “fix your old code with a macro-like script” approach just shifts maintenance costs elsewhere. We’d still be chasing edge cases, except now they’re tucked away behind code-generation layers and elaborate type transformations. It may reduce immediate breakage, but at the expense of clarity and predictable behavior in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way you handle breaking changes in SQL is views, not migrations; the latter is only appropriate single applications abusing SQL as a data store[0].In code, if you want to handle a breaking change transparently, you don't need the moral equivalent of a linker fix-up table. You need to keep the old definition around and redirect it to the new function. This can be as simple as having, say, the old version of your code wrap something in a list or closure and then call the new version. In languages with overloading, this can be done transparently; in others you'd have to give the new function a new name. Maybe API versioned symbols and a syntax for them is what you would want?[0] The original idea with SQL is that multiple applications would store data in the same place in a common format you could meaningfully interchange.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497506</guid></item><item><title>38.

Simplicity provides a lot benefits over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I understand all this, no objections at all, I just wonder if the easier thing to do here is to write the blog posts in HTML and drop them in a folder for a web server, the same way I learned to do websites 25 years ago.  What's making this complicated is the Markdown and if you want something lightweight, Markdown doesn't pull its weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why Is This Site Built with CBecause you are developer who enjoys coding, and you will find any and every excuse to spend more time writing code than you care to admit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526058</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloud has always been more expensive. I remember being quoted 250k/month for bandwidth when I was paying 15k with rackspace 10+ years ago. You’re paying for convenience and speed. The Math stops working when you grow to a certain point.You can mitigate this to some extent by making some key architecture + vendor decisions upfront when first building… or just consider that some day you’ll need to do things like this. It’s not a novel problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago (10+) when I was deciding to use aws or hosting our own hardware in a colo for my company I found a spreadsheet where you plug in your hardware and hosting costs and the current Amazon pricing for their various products and it would give you how long to break-even on the initial investment.It was always just above three years to break even. After we decided to self-host I still kept tracking the prices in the spreadsheet and as hardware costs fluctuated Amazon adjusted their prices to match. I figured someone at Amazon must have had the same spreadsheet I was working with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; $1.5 million/yearThat is excessive and it's already $4K a day.Lots of teams really underestimate cloud costs since there is an assumption that the hundreds of millions they are raising will give them enough runway to survive a few years despite losing money for years.Even scaling would be somewhat of an issue depending on the tech stack. Imagine the cost of running standard Java micro-services and the "solution" was to "spin up hundreds of more nodes". The worst that I have seen was a bank proudly having up to 8,000 - 10,000 separate micro-services.Just imagine the daily cost of that. Unjustifiable.But of course the AWS cloud consultants would be happy to shill you their offerings at "cheap" prices, but in reality the pricing is designed for you to accumulate millions in costs as you scale on the tiniest amount of usage, even for testing.So before you build the software, one must think about the costs of scaling if it becomes widely used rather than taking the easy approach in just spinning up nodes and increasing more costs and act as if you don't have the capital to solve the problem. You can only do that for so long until you don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489698</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a summer intern at IBM Kinston NY, where the PC hardware was being developed.  I remember being told by one of the engineers that IBM had decided to use standard components for the PC, except for the keyboard.The original keyboard was so bad (he said) it was also replaced, I think in 1981 or 1982.  Apparently the group in charge had internal disagreements leading to a compromise design.(I have no proof of this and my memory is going,  so any corroboration or rebuttal would be welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; IBM announces the 3161 and 3163 ASCII Display Stations, serial-based terminals in the IBM 3101 lineage that were capable of emulating various third-party terminals. They sported the first terminal-specific IBM Enhanced Keyboards, which typically have an extra key over ANSI and ISO PC-style Enhanced Keyboards, and ASCII-style ones like 316X's often uniquely have line drawing symbols on their numeric keypads.And of course you'll be playing rogue.https://sharktastica.co.uk/resources/images/terminals/Wyatt8...(Nethack came out two years later)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keyboarding was taught in my middle school using Selectrics and my high school was equipped with Model Ms on Model 50s (oh, IBM).Those two sublime instruments of typing superiority made it so that when I type I type so quickly that people have thought I was pantomiming on several occasions.As far as I'm concerned IBM solved the text input problem over a half century ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520297</guid></item><item><title>45.

Like protobuf, it's compact and possible to evolve, plus I actually find it easier to deal with, since it decodes to native types, not protobuf wrappers. And you can read it in basically any language, which makes is super easy to debugging binary files/streams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nlohmann::json also does msgpack and is header-only, and it's the most popular JSON lib for C++ https://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=readme-ov-file#design-g...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519930</guid></item><item><title>46.

First, Claude3.7 is probably their backend model.  Gemini 2.5 Pro is definitely getting there but I'm pretty sure Claude is still king for this kind of work.  Second, if you break up the design and then implementation, you get significantly better responses.   Finally, you have throw in a bit of what I'm calling stable-diffusion-prompt-isms where you almost excessively drop references to known brands or design philosophies to trigger those 'latent' memories and steer away from the more-basic stuff that seems to otherwise surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roo-Code with Claude Sonnet 3.7 as the backend has worked near perfect for me for small websites.If you point it to a site to clone with instructions on what to change, you get very good results in half an hour's work and &lt;5$ spent.Pretty stiff competition for the bottom end of the web creation/maitainance market for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor has gone to the next level with Gemini 2.5. The reasons it gives for what it’s doing are well thought through and far more in context.Gemini seems to now advise you when you’re telling it to do something that may not make sense - first time I’ve really seen a non-Yes Man LLM.

Brightness / Contrast in "image editor of choice (or financial availability)""Dust", especially, tends to severely darken the image on every setting other than "screen".Generally, cool that it's done totally in browser, and better than what's available on a lot of phone apps.Photoshop's "texturizer" from decades ago would be something else to possible look at.  Making a quick "canvas" look to the image, and similar "noise".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43491245</guid></item><item><title>48. “Moonshots” Initiative to Secure the Future of RISC OS</title><link>https://www.riscosopen.org/news/articles/2025/03/28/moonshots-initiative-to-secure-the-future-of-the-os</link><description>

They have been getting sponsorship for small improvements.32bit Arm is going away.They are looking for the resources for a 64bit port.That seems like an entirely reasonable ask.  I don't know if enough people are interested but it seems entirely reasonable to ask.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasn't OpenVMS stuck in a similar situation in the late 1980s, where they had tons of VAX MACRO assembly files they had to transpile to Alpha, then Itanium and nowadays x86_64?VAX is a rather different beast than 32-bit ARM and that bandaid would result in a hybrid 32/64-bit operating system, but I wonder if a similar solution could be implemented for RISC OS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context: https://www.riscosopen.org/content/documents/risc-os-moonsho...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519100</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of writing tests in software development, particularly when using Rust. It advocates for a proactive approach where developers should write tests alongside their code to ensure functionality and reliability. The author discusses the benefits of testing, such as catching bugs early and improving code maintainability. Additionally, it provides insights into various testing strategies and tools available in Rust, encouraging programmers to integrate testing seamlessly into their workflow for better project outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This wasn’t caught by the existing test suite (even though it runs almost 200 end-to-end tests), because it always starts from an empty database, applies all migrations and only then runs the test code.Isn't that where the test coverage has a hole?I somehow expected the blog post to extend testing for this. A pre-populated database which is then migrated. That seems to catch a wider class of issues than parsing sql and shielding against just checking for non-null without default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(author of the post)Just to clarify a bit, the test ofc isn't a fully general solution to solving issues with database migrations (I hinted what that might be in the blog post), although it's still useful to provide a nice error message even if a more general solution was implemented.That was not at all the goal of the post. I just wanted to appreciate how easy it was to achieve this specific task in Rust. In any other systems programming language that I used (even most other languages, except maybe for Python), I would never even imagine something like this being feasible, and so easy to do. That's it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relatedhttps://github.com/sbdchd/squawk"linter for PostgreSQL, focused on migrations"It covers this class of problem I think&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43480459</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recognition of the demoscene as a form of cultural heritage in Sweden, emphasizing its importance in digital art and technology. It describes how the demoscene, which involves the creation of audio-visual presentations through programming, showcases creativity and technical skill. The piece highlights efforts to preserve and promote this unique subculture as part of UNESCO's heritage initiatives, reflecting on its impact on the broader landscape of digital creativity and its role in fostering community and innovation within the tech domain.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really interesting to read about this! That's wonderful validation for a vital digital culture and its heritage.As the creator of Glicol (https://glicol.org/), based in Oslo and working in the digital arts space, I'm always fascinated by how different countries foster creative technology. Sweden's approach in recognizing the demoscene this way is particularly encouraging.It makes me reflect on the pathways to support here in Norway. While academic environments can be very supportive (as my previous supervisors have been), navigating the broader public arts funding structures for newer digital art forms sometimes feels more challenging, especially perhaps for those working outside of long-established networks.Seeing Sweden's success in formally recognizing this kind of digital heritage is genuinely inspiring and offers food for thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a scener since the early 90s, I'm thrilled with these announcements. Personally, what I'd like to see come of it is an increase in the amount of academic studies of the scene at the intersection of art, technology, and anthropology. A careful study of the scene, what makes it unique, how it bleeds into other adjacent scenes (and what those are), sub-scenes, core elements of demoscene art and tech, all those things would be really interesting.They've all been written about by sceners in the past, but I think more outside observations would be enlightening. As a demoscener, you know what is scene and what isn't, and basically how it works. But I've found it nearly impossible to succinctly explain it to non-sceners without sounding like I'm crazy, or making it up, or giving them a very wrong understanding of core demo elements (e.g. "so it's all about doing things in small sizes?")One leg up, the scene has done a very good job archiving information about scene groups, sceners, scene productions, and sub-scene productions, giving future researchers a lot of information to start from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's 12 years old now, but I am still extremely impressed by this 64k intro https://geidav.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/making-of-turtles-al... and also by this 4k intro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YWMGuh15nE :)And overall this website is extremely interesting with tutorials and code and great explanations https://iquilezles.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533362</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The same solo author (a computer scientist) has made many similar claims based on a variety of datasets. Often coming to completely contradictory conclusions. Some of these claims have been followed up by astronomers, who found errors in his analysis and poor statistical tests. His claims have been discussed in this sub before. Independent studied have found no significant evidence of anisotropy.https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/534/2/1553/7762193https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907..123I/abstra...https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466.3928H/abstra...&gt;Take his claims about JWST as an example. In 2024 he wrote a paper about some early data, claiming to find more galaxies rotating with the Milky Way. He claimed based on a sample of just 34 galaxies that the signal was significant. Now he has looked at a wider dataset of the same area, which should allow him to verify his analysis. But it shows exactly the opposite, more anti. So he writes a paper saying this new result is definitely significant but doesn't reflect on the fact he has written two papers which contradict each other. He has failed to reproduce his own result. The take away is that his results are not as significant as he claims. He's also looking at a tiny area, and nearby galaxies can have correlated spins. He doesn't take this into account either. There are multiple JWST fields in different directions he could examine in different directions to test his claims, there are two JADES fields, but he only publishes one.&gt;I do wish the MNRAS editors would take measures to stop publishing low quality claims like this without more robust review. If you look at the text, it’s largely repeating results from his old papers. There’s very little discussion of the new results.source: https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/1ja9i53/the_dist...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially a very dumb question, but seeing the difference between cyclones and hurricane on earth (clock-wise, anti-clock-wise)...Does it mean that we are, potentially, on one of two poles(?) of the observable universe, if we're observing most galaxies around us rotating a certain way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like we've got a few of these imbalances now where you'd expect 50:50 but instead it's skewed to one side where nature had a different ideaMatter-antimatter ratioLeft vs right handed moleculesNow galaxy spin directionsMaybe there are others I missed too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533306</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the distinction between reliability and capability in systems and engineering contexts. It emphasizes that reliability refers to the consistent performance and dependability of a system under given conditions, while capability relates to the system's ability to perform its intended functions effectively. The author argues that a system can be reliable without being capable, as well as capable without being reliable. The discussion highlights the importance of balancing both aspects in the design and evaluation of systems to ensure their effectiveness and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, the "book a flight" agent thing is a running joke now - it was a punchline in the Swyx keynote for the recent AI Engineer event in NYC: https://www.latent.space/p/agentI think this piece is underestimating the difficulty involved here though. If only it was as easy as "just pick a single task and make the agent really good at that"!The problem is that if your UI involves human beings typing or talking to you in a human language, there is an unbounded set of ways things could go wrong. You can't test against every possible variant of what they might say. Humans are bad at clearly expressing things, but even worse is the challenge of ensuring they have a concrete, accurate mental model of what the software can and cannot do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've (ex Google Deepmind researchers) been doing research in increasing the reliability of agents and realized it is pretty non-trivial, but there are a lot of techniques to improve it. The most important thing is doing rigorous evals that are representative of what your users do in your product. Often this is not the same as academic benchmarks. We made our own benchmarks to measure progress.Plug: We just posted a demo of our agent doing sophisticated reasoning over a huge dataset ((JFK assassination files -- 80,000 PDF pages): https://x.com/peterjliu/status/1906711224261464320Even on small amounts of files, I think there's quite a palpable difference in reliability/accuracy vs the big AI players.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Booking a flight is actually task I cannot outsource to a human assistant, let alone AI. Maybe it's a third-world problem or just me being cheap, but there are heuristics involved when booking flights for a family trip or even just for myself.Check the official website, compare pricing with aggregator, check other dates, check people's availability on cheap dates. Sometimes I only do the first step if the official price is reasonable (I travel 1-2x a month, so I have expectation "how much it should cost").Don't get me started if I also consider which credit card to use for the points rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535653</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Oracle's alleged attempt to conceal a significant cybersecurity incident involving its Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. It details how customers were reportedly not informed about the breach, raising concerns over transparency and trust. The piece highlights the importance of communication from companies when addressing security vulnerabilities and emphasizes the potential risks users face when they are kept in the dark about such incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are already a customer of Oracle, I can't imagine this matters to you. You did not choose Oracle because it was a good product and they are a good company. You are a customer of Oracle because there was a backroom executive deal with the Devil. No one is surprised or outraged or even has any choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is honestly wild.Whether we like it or not security incidents have become such common place in the last several years that if they just admitted to it this entire story would have likely been shrugged off and mostly forgotten about in a couple days but instead it is turning into an entire thing that just seems to be getting deeper and deeper.  (Not downplaying the security incident, but that is the unfortunate reality).Seriously if I can't trust that I am going to actually be told and not lied too when there is a security incident at the bare minimum, why would I chose to work with a company? What is Oracle's end goal here?Are they somehow really confident that this didn't happen, maybe they don't have the logs to confirm it? Trying to think about how this is anything except them just straight up lying.I can't remember the last time we saw a company this strongly try to deny that something like this happened. Especially when according to Ars Technica:&gt; On Friday, when I asked Oracle for comment, a spokesperson asked if they could provide a statement that couldn’t be attributed to Oracle in any way. After I declined, the spokesperson said Oracle would have no comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are various state laws that require companies to notify their customers of security breaches, but they lack enforcement/teeth so they're routinely ignored. It'll never happen in our current environment but we really need a federal law that causes violators enough pain that companies will actually bother to follow the law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535953</guid></item><item><title>7.

But since selects can do things that you simply cannot recreate in HTML, e.g. have options drop downs that extend outside the viewport boundaries, makes this a really helpful feature.Now, do autocompletes and tag selectors next...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The challenge till this is widely supported (caniuse.com currently pegs it at 46% globally [1]) will be using this as a progressive enhancement that does not provide a worse or unusable experience for users with browsers not supporting it yet.In other words, don’t include critical information or functionality in the new styling that isn’t available in the underlying plain select element! But such is always a good practice anyway.Very nice to see this taking shape though! Should be a huge improvement over the div monster that custom select box replacements often are. :)[1] https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_appearance_base-selec...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It doesn't trigger built-in mobile operating system components.I worry about this. The built-in mobile operating system components are reliable, accessible, and responsive. I really like it when an input element opens the Android UI because I know how it works and that it is reliable. This applies to &lt;select&gt;, but also date/time inputs for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532830</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++ provides a comprehensive overview of compiler options and techniques aimed at enhancing code security. It outlines various compiler flags that can help mitigate vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, and code injection attacks. The guide emphasizes best practices for using these options across different compilers, such as GCC, Clang, and MSVC, and encourages developers to adopt these strategies to produce more secure software. Additionally, it offers practical examples and explanations of the impact these options have on program behavior and security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes they're embedded in the compiler itself through a patch or configure flag, and sometimes they're added through CFLAGS variables during the compilation of distribution packages. I can only really speak of gentoo, but here's a non-exhaustive list:* -fPIE is enabled with --enable-default-pie in GCC's ./configure script* -fstack-protector-strong is enabled with --enable-default-ssp in GCC's ./configure script* -Wl,-z,relro is enabled with --enable-relro in Binutils' ./configure script* -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -fstack-clash-protection, -Wl,-z,now and -fcf-protection=full are enabled by default through patches to GCC in Gentoo.* -Wl,--as-needed is enabled through the default LDFLAGSFor reference, here's the default compiler flags for a few other distributions. Note that these don't include GCC patches:* Arch Linux: https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/pa...* Alpine Linux: https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/abuild/-/blob/master/d...* Debian: It's a tiny bit more obscure, but running `dpkg-buildflags` on a fresh container returns the following: CFLAGS=-g -O2 -Werror=implicit-function-declaration -ffile-prefix-map=/home/&lt;myuser&gt;=. -fstack-protector-strong -fstack-clash-protection -Wformat -Werror=format-security -fcf-protection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are taking notes, add `-fzero-init-padding-bits=all` to the list, without this flag, GCC 15 onwards will not zero-initialize a full union if you wrote pre-C23 style ={0} and the largest member is not the first one. `-ftrivial-auto-var-init` cannot help this case. https://godbolt.org/z/7zKccfnea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533516</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unique phenomenon of downloading games via radio in the 1980s, exploring how enthusiasts utilized audio technology to receive data from radio broadcasts. It highlights the innovative methods employed by programmers and gamers to transfer games, the community around this practice, and the nostalgic value associated with it. The piece emphasizes the creativity and resourcefulness of that era, detailing how this experience shaped early digital interactions and laid the groundwork for modern software distribution methods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely had cassette based games on the TRS-80, but most of the "wireless" transmission in my youth was via BASIC printed in the back of computer magazines. You had to type in the entire app yourself. I did this for basically every app they listed. Sometimes it was like tax prep software, but I didn't care, even though I was like 9 at the time. Yes, it took a very long time. Yes, you could easily introduce typos and bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my subjective experience, having "been there at the time", I think this was sufficiently obscure that "not really a thing" is not an unreasonable take. It's a bit like "Yes, in the 2020s we got NFTs tattooed on our bodies".Edit: Although having just googled it it seems like NFT tattoos might be more of a thing than I was aware, so what do I know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The transmissions from NOS in The Netherlands could be received here in Denmark, and I actually succeeded in downloading several programs based on the BASICODE 2 standard. At that time (eighties), people had all sorts of home computers, but this way we could actually run the same programs, whether you had a BBC computer, a ZX81 or one of the many other brands.
The way it worked was that the programs used a common (primitive) BASIC dialect, and where there was a difference, a subroutine was added with a high line number.
E.g. instead of clear screen you would just write GOSUB 100.
There's a user manual here:

&lt;p&gt;Turso is launching a public beta for its offline sync feature, which allows developers to build applications that can function without an internet connection. This feature enables users to make changes locally and sync data back to the cloud once they are online again. The blog outlines the benefits of offline-first applications, including improved user experience and accessibility. It also provides details on how developers can get started with this new feature, encouraging them to experiment and provide feedback to enhance its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, certain db write is only permitted for certain users, but when the db API is exposed, will that cause problems? A concrete example would be a forum where only moderators can remove users and posts. Say if I build an offline first forum, can a hacker hack the database on the filesystem and utilize the syncing feature to propagate the hacked data to the server?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just wrote a post about this kind of stuff and why it's (almost always) nonsense.  You will spend more time and effort trying to shoe-horn SQLite into a server database than you will ever get any benefits from.https://benwilber.github.io/programming/2025/03/31/sqlite-is...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535943</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of a new bat called the "torpedo" by the New York Yankees, highlighting its innovative design and potential impact on player performance. It describes the bat's features, such as its unique shape and materials intended to enhance swing speed and power. The piece also includes insights from Yankees players and coaches about their expectations for the bat's effectiveness in the upcoming season, emphasizing the team's focus on improving hitting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's quite cool (disclaimer: I am indeed a dirty Yankees fan)Hitting is really hard. If you feel up to it, and can find a public batting cage near you that has a fast pitch machine (usually maxes out 75-85mph which is 20+ mph less than your typical MLB fastball), give it a shot. When you hit the ball away from the sweet spot, especially on the parts closer to your hands, it really freaking hurts and throws off subsequent swings.If the few players who are using this bat tend to hit that spot naturally, it makes a lot of sense to modify the bat to accommodate it, within the rules like they've done here. Hitting is super, super difficult especially today with how far we're pushing pitchers. Love seeing them try to innovate.Plus, reminder, most of the team isn't using it. Judge clobbered the ball that day with his normal bat. Brewer's pitching is injured, and the starter that day was a Yankee last year and the team is intimately familiar with his game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"you can’t just make a new bat and ruin over 100 years of baseball"If this jabroni was in charge of sports, there'd be no forward pass, no three-point line, no fosbury flop. Sports should be frozen in a specific moment of this guy's choosing. MLB batting averages have been on a steady, multi-decade decline as pitching quality and strategy has improved[1], so God forbid we do something to add some offense.[1] https://apnews.com/article/mlb-vanishing-offense-allstar-b48...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If only the Yankees get access to it (e.g. they patented it and won't let other teams use it) then I could see it as an unfair advantage. In most other areas of America life, though, this innovation would be allowed or even celebrated.I imagine it will go the way of the brilliant strategic innovation a few years back of shifting defenders heavily depending on the batter's statistical hitting patterns. It'll get banned because it makes the game more boring. If home runs happen all the time, they lose their excitement. I imagine it's quite expensive or impossible to shift the outfield walls back farther in most MLB stadiums.I actually would love more of a no holds barred evolutionary battle in the MLB [1] but I know it's not gonna happen.[1] https://youtu.be/gTmLz9B8wls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43536146</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of indoor air pollution on student achievement, highlighting how poor air quality in schools can negatively affect cognitive performance and learning outcomes. Research indicates that elevated levels of pollutants like carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter can impair concentration and memory, leading to lower academic performance. The piece emphasizes the importance of improving ventilation and air quality in educational environments to create healthier learning conditions and foster better student achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm all for installing air filters in classrooms for a number of reasons, but I also think the extreme results from this study aren't going to hold up to further research.From the paper:&gt; To do so, I leverage a unique setting arising from the largest gas leak in United States history, whereby the offending gas company installed air filters in every classroom, office and common area for all schools within five miles of the leak (but not beyond). This variation allows me to compare student achievement in schools receiving air filters relative to those that did not using a spatial regression discontinuity design.In other words, the paper looked at test scores at different schools in different areas on different years and assumed that the only change was the air filters. Anyone who has worked with school kids knows that the variations between classes from year to year can be extreme, as can differences produced by different teachers or even school policies.Again, I think air filtration is great indoors, but expecting test scores to improve dramatically like this is not realistic. This feels like another extremely exaggerated health claim, like past claims made about fish oil supplements. Fish oil was briefly thought to have extreme positive health benefits from a number of very small studies like this, but as sample sizes became larger and studies became higher quality, most of the beneficial effects disappeared.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone writes whether the data actually shows what it purports to show: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/01/09/filters-be...&gt; The whole thing is driven by one data point and a linear trend which makes no theoretical sense in the context of the paper (from the abstract: “Air testing conducted inside schools during the leak (but before air filters were installed) showed no presence of natural gas pollutants, implying that the effectiveness of air filters came from removing common air pollutants”) but does serve to create a background trend to allow a big discontinuity with some statistical significance.I’m reminded of the walkback of scientific studies showing massive benefits from giving kids in third world countries deworming medications: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/23/research-glo....My beef with Matt Y.’s worldview of “scientifically driven public policy” is that the costs and benefits of public policy interventions are so devilishly difficult to study that you can’t meaningfully use them on realistic time scales to drive policy. This is an exceedingly simple hypothesis—filtering air improves test scores—that can easily be tested while controlling for confounding factors. But even then it’s hard!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was more data on the effects of gasses in the air on people.We seem to know:- Elevated CO2 in rooms impairs cognitive performance.- Elevated CO2 in submarines, at levels far higher than you would see in a normal room does not appear to impact cognitive performance.- Installing carbon filters (what this study actually looked at) might improve classroom performance.- People don’t like stuffy rooms.All this is consistent with multiple hypotheses.  It could be that we just don’t know anything about it. Or maybe there is some gas or gasses emitted by people that isn’t CO2 that makes people mildly uncomfortable and have worse cognitive performance.CO2 is certainly a good proxy for ventilation quality in a space where air is exchanged with outdoors but where the gasses in the air are not otherwise changed. Carbon-filtered classrooms and submarines are not examples of this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529257</guid></item><item><title>15.

I'd be shocked if any LLM can do this:https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace/issues/1414Make a GTK 4 version of Solvespace. We have a single C++ file for each platform - Windows, Mac, and Linux-GTK3. There is also a QT version on an unmerged branch for reference. The GTK3 file is under 2KLOC. You do not need to create a new version, just rewrite the GTK3 Linux version to GTK4. You may either ask it to port what's there or create the new one from scratch.If you want to do this for free to prove how great the AI is, please document the entire session. Heck make a YouTube video of it. The final test is weather I accept the PR or not - and I WANT this ticket done.I'm not going to hold my breath.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini is the only model which tells me when it's a good time to stop chatting because either it can't find a solution or because it dislikes my solution (when I actively want to neglect security).And the context length is just amazing. When ChatGPT's context is full, it totally forgets what we were chatting about, as if it would start an entirely new chat.Gemini lacks the tooling, there ChatGPT is far ahead, but at its core, Gemini feels like a better model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was using gemini 2.5 pro yesterday and it does seem decent. I still think claude 3.5 is better at following instruction then the new 3.7 model which just goes ham messing stuff up.   Really disappointed by Cursor and the Claude CLI tool, for me they create more problems then fix. I cant figure out how to use them on any of my projects with out them ruining the project and creating terrible tech debt.   
I really like the way gemini shows how much context window is left, i think every company should have this.  To be honest i think there has been no major improvement beyond the original models which gained popularity first.  Its just marginal improvements 10% better or something, and the free models like deepseek are actually better imo then anything openai has.  I dont think the market can withstand the valuations of the big ai companies.  They have no advantage, there models suck worse then free open source ones, and they charge money???  Where is the benefit to there product??  People originally said the models are the moat and methods are top secret, but turns out its pretty easy to reproduce these models, and its the application layer built on top of the models that is much more specific and has the real moat.  People said the models would engulf these applications built ontop and just integrate natively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534029</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to make sure I am understanding this.If I have an application that uses OpenAI models then this service can act as a proxy between the my application and the actual OpenAI service. It logs all of the requests that get sent to the OpenAI api. At some later time, I can go through and choose a subset of the API calls and mark them (I'm guessing as good or bad) and these get converted into a training set. I then have to create a value function as its own API that I run on my own servers somewhere (like fly.io). Then I start a training run, which I assume will use some open source AI model to regenerate responses to the training set derived from my initial OpenAI api calls. It then takes the generated responses from that open source model, sends them to my value function api which scores them, and then uses that score to apply some RL magic to the base open source model. At the end of this process I have an open source model that has been RL trained based on the captured api calls as well as the scoring from the value function.I suppose the argument here is, a RL trained open source model will perform your task better than the base OpenAI model. So your target market is, people already using OpenAI api, they have the desire and funds to experiment with RL, they have the capability of defining a value function, they are able to sift through their api calls to identify the ones that aren't performing well and isolate them, and they are willing to swap out their OpenAI model with an open source model that is RL trained if it can be shown it is more accurate.I would guess this market exists and the need is real. Defining a value function is much easier than building the infrastructure to RL a variety of open source models. So someone who wants to do this may appreciate paying for someone else who has already set up the infrastructure. And they don't want to host their own model (their already paying for OpenAI model hosting) so maybe they have no problem paying you for inference as well.Whether or not this succeeds as a business really depends on how effective RL is for the clients you find. There are two paths here, RL is wildly successful and therefore so are you. Or RL fine-tuning is unable to keep up with foundation model advancements and clients will learn it is better to wait it out on the big fellas rather than go through the time-consuming and costly process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks great.I have a few questions. 1. I'm assuming by the pricing it's "serverless" inference, what's the cold-start time like? 2. Any idea on inference costs?Also just to reiterate what others say but the option of exporting weights would definitely make it more appealing (although it sounds like that's in the roadmap).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tell you what I don't like, the game y'all are playing with billing of Slack users:  Where do you want to access #ext-customers?
    The organization you select is where you’ll find this channel in Slack. Admins will get a chance to review everything before you start collaborating.
    Tip: Add this Slack Connect channel to the organization that’s already connected with P2P Industries, or where you have similar channels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43537505</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The project on GitHub provides a detailed guide for quickly installing Windows 98 on a virtual machine. It includes instructions for setting up necessary software, configuring the environment, and downloading the Windows 98 files. The aim is to facilitate an easy and efficient installation process for users interested in experiencing or testing the Windows 98 operating system in a modern context. The repository also features a list of requirements, troubleshooting tips, and additional resources to support users throughout the installation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds of the Ghost (was it Norton Ghost?) tool. I use to experiment with the file system and try out many many all kinds of softwares from Internet and software CDs. Those CDs use to come with 100s of softwares of all kind. I use to buy them and then try out every single one of them. I use to maintain an index, using IYF, to find a software in any of those CDs.Anyway these softwares use to have there crack/patch tools with them (with music and effects and whatnot). These cracks often had virus or trojen in them. I have bored my windows many many times. Ghost helped with that immensely. I had 1 or 2 fresh install with basic setup ghost backup always available. After every bork, it only took a minute to restore my windows to fresh clean state. Kaspersky was the best anti virus back then, no other tool repaired my corrupted softwares like it. Norton anti virus use to scream only after getting infected itself.We have it lot easy now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I debated building something like this for a couple years with my "Ultimate Windows 98 PC" [1]I found that I could take the machine to vintage computer events and it would (generally!) behave the entire event. I'd then take it home and put it back on the shelf for a few months. After I'd bring it back down to use it again, it'd throw a fit and usually require a reinstall! It's not disk rot since I use SSD's throughoutWhile this hasn't happened (this time) it's a constant looming concern, particularly when pressed for time to get something up and running for an event.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETxI4rA_gs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Running Win98 is still the most reliable way to get Discworld Noir to actually run; a gem of a game, made almost useless by the aggressive DRM practices of the time.Bookmarking this for future use :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43530889</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to automate story logic in narrative-driven projects, such as games or interactive fiction. It explores the benefits of integrating LLMs to enhance storytelling by generating dynamic plots and character interactions based on player choices. The article emphasizes the importance of structuring story components and outlines strategies for effectively implementing LLMs to maintain coherence and engagement in narratives, ultimately improving the overall storytelling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GPTel is a very powerful interface for working with LLMs in Emacs. It took me a while to understand that its real value isn't what you get with M-x gptel, which creates a dedicated chat session and buffer, but rather the ability to sling prompts, context, and LLM output around in a native Emacs way. You can add to the context from dired, from a file, from a buffer, you can select from various prescribed system prompts for different functionality, you can prompt from the minibuffer, the kill-ring, the existing buffer, a selection, you can have the responses go to the minibuffer, the kill-ring, a buffer, the echo area -- it's extremely flexible.I have a little helper function that uses gptel-request that I use while reading Latin texts. It sets the system prompt so the LLM acts as either a Latin to English translator, or with a prefix argument it breaks down the grammatical structure and vocabulary of a sentence for me. It's very cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the most promising uses of LLMs that I have found in my own work. Many times I have an idea for a refactor or even a feature but I have this mental reluctance just due to the amount of code I would have to write. Like, I have this counter in my head on the number of key-strokes it will take to write a wrapper object in several places, and I hesitate.Just being able to tell an LLM "rewrite all of this code using this new pattern" and then dozens of code sites are correctly updated is a huge help. It makes me consider bigger refactoring or minor features that I might normally skip because I am lazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gwern shared an idea how to exploit the strength of current-generation LLMs, despite their weaknesses, for "create your own adventure"-style fiction. https://gwern.net/cyoa Having people vote on AI-generated potential continuations should yield better results and cut costs at the same time.From the title I thought this was an implementation of Gwern's idea, but it's not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43536463</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an introduction to the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), explaining its role in email retrieval and management. It outlines the differences between IMAP and other protocols like POP3, highlighting the advantages of using IMAP for accessing emails from multiple devices while maintaining synchronization. The piece also covers key features of IMAP such as folder management, message flags, and server-side operations, making it a valuable resource for developers and users looking to understand how IMAP works and its benefits for email handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513967"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started writing a guide to IMAP back when I was working on an email client: https://github.com/rmccue/griffin/tree/master/docs/imapPulling large amounts of data for things like threading can be difficult on certain servers; my preferred approach ended up being to pull every ID and thread ID to maintain an in-memory tree. (This was, iirc, partially because Gmail’s implementation was slightly crippled with relation to threading.)(I never finished the guide because I stopped on the project, alas - if IMAP were easier to work with, I might have finished it! And sadly, no JMAP support on Gmail, and the gateway was broken.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the extra interested… reminded me of this one: https://explained-from-first-principles.com/email/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working on some email stuff and I think probably four things are vexing about IMAP:- The grammar is hard. I built a parser using lpeg and I'm incredibly glad I did--doing it ad hoc won't lead to good results.- It's an asynchronous protocol. You can send lots of requests to a server and you have to tag them so you can match them up with responses later. You don't generally want to do that in a client; i.e. you don't want to do these transactional things over an async connection and track state across all of it. You want to like, block on deleting things, renaming things, sending things, etc.- IMAP is multi-user--it's built around the idea of multiple clients accessing the same mailbox at the same time and streaming updates. Another thing you really don't want to deal with when building an email client.- There's functionality that you basically shouldn't use; the big one is search. Even the specs more or less say "good luck using this".You can group all this under the a heading of "we thought people would use this over telnet", but attachments and non-plain-text email I think made that non-viable.I think this all means probably every non-web email client treats IMAP like POP and keeps its own store. I haven't done a survey or anything, but I'd be surprised if that weren't true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513967</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;JEP 8349536 proposes the addition of a new method to the `java.lang.reflect.Method` class in the Java Development Kit (JDK), allowing users to retrieve the corresponding `Method` object for constant method references, enhancing the reflection capabilities of the Java language. This enhancement aims to simplify the retrieval and usage of method references in reflective operations, thereby improving developer productivity and making it easier to work with the method reference feature introduced in Java 8. The JEP includes an overview of the motivation behind the change, its implementation details, and the impact on existing code and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm, not a bad approach.I think the one thing that'd be nice is if I could somehow tell the JVM from a class that this class is open for final mutation rather than needing special flags passed into the JVM or special manifests in the Jar.  It's often pretty clear to me, as a dev, what I when I need something to have final mutation (generally only with serialization objects).For example,    @FinalMutatableByReflection
    class Foo {
      final String bar;
    }

That'd allow me to transition code by just adding an annotation where it needs to be while also getting the benefit that final is really final everywhere else in code that isn't working with serialization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written my fair share of nasty reflexive code for testing or for abusing libraries, but I don't think I've ever overwritten final fields in this way. Private fields, sure. But not final.Sounds like a good evolution to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there was a r/nottheonion for tech :DJokes aside, I thought the ability to mutate final fields was already removed/restricted after Java 17 :/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538919</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;A significant discovery at Cambridge University involves a previously unknown medieval manuscript related to the Arthurian legend of Merlin. This manuscript, considered a vital addition to the study of literature and history, sheds light on the narrative surrounding the legendary wizard, revealing unique insights into its themes and cultural impact. The discovery not only enhances the understanding of medieval texts but also highlights the ongoing relevance of these stories in contemporary discussions about folklore and literature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe one of the early maps of the americas by Amerigo Vespucci was found in a similar way. Re-using paper to hand making the binding, padding the covers, wrapping the bound signatures before the outer leather or board was added was surprisingly common. John Le Carré uses it in "the perfect spy" as a mechanism to pass secret information to an amateur book binder.It speaks to me of Robert Grave's fictitious account of Claudius deciding rather than hiding them, to leave his (fictional) autobiographical scrolls just lying around, let history decide what to keep and what to dispose of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that a 13th-century Arthurian manuscript was quietly hiding inside a 16th-century book cover for centuries is wild enough on its own, but the way they virtually unfolded it without causing damage feels almost as magical as the story of Merlin itself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"La suite vulgate du Merlin" might translate as: "the vulgate follow up of THE Merlin", which I find quite curious. Modern French would rather say: "DE Merlin". It was as if Merlin was not a proper name but the name of some creature of the Merlin species, or some kind of properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529709</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This could use a bit more explanation. For instance:How many points and how many bonus moves do you get for a capture? Does it depend on what you capture? (It looks like it's one bonus move whatever you capture, but more points for more valuable pieces; 1 for a pawn, 3 for a bishop, so I'll guess it's 5 for a rook and 9 for a queen.)Does "Beware of attackers!" mean (1) you aren't allowed to move the knight to a square that's attached, (2) you will get some points deducted when you do, or (3) nothing, it's just flavour-text? (It looks like it's #2, a loss of one point each time you move to a square that's attacked.)The instructions don't mention the "clean board" bonus; I think they should.I'd write it something like this:Complete each level by reaching the target within the given number of moves.Each piece you capture gives you one more move, and points according to the value of the piece.You lose one point any time you move to a square that's attacked.Your score for the level is the number of moves you had spare at the end, times the number of points you earned. Double if you captured all the pieces!(... Except that it looks as if there's some further "streak" mechanic, which I haven't tried to figure out the details of.)If that's too long, put it behind a clicky-button, and just say "Get your knight to the target square. Earn points for getting there quickly without being attacked, and capturing pieces on the way." plus a button labelled something like "Full rules".Maybe make the notification when you capture a piece say something like "+3 points / +1 move"?If the levels get fairly crowded then it might be expensive to get the computer to find the best possible score, but it shouldn't be hard to make it find a pretty good score. You could present that, either at the start or after the user finishes the level, as a target, and congratulate them when they meet or even beat it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Way back when Flash was a thing, one of the teachers at my kiddo's school started a chess club. They never played a full game of chess, but other games that taught the kids how to move the pieces and not burden them with the strategy of a full game. I decided to try to turn a few of those into Flash based games. It was fun making each of the pieces with the rules limiting their movement which became a game on its own just to show where pieces could go or not. Then adding more pieces to start playing the games. I never worked it up to the point of having player vs computer though. Glad to see other people also thinking chess based games could be made without needing a vs computer as well.I think this game would be perfect for a young kids chess club. Nice job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was fun.  I played for a few minutes and like how there seem to be multiple ways to play the game-1. just get through the level and not worry about losing points2. get through the level without losing any points but not worrying about clearing all the pieces3. absolute perfection where you clear all the pieces without losing any pointsThis flexibility makes it good for serious players but also kids/casual players.  Great job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43515622</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;France has fined Apple €150 million for imposing excessive pop-ups that hinder users from rejecting tracking on their devices. The country’s competition authority concluded that Apple's practices created an unfair advantage in promoting its tracking features, which goes against consumer rights. The ruling emphasizes the importance of transparent and user-friendly consent processes and aims to protect users from being overwhelmed by repetitive prompts that complicate the decision to opt-out of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actually Apple were fined because they don't apply the same standard to their own pop-ups that allow users to reject tracking. On Apple popups you seem to need one click, while on 3rd party popups you need to confirm twice.So the fine seems to be for treating 3rd parties differently from their own stuff.They could make their own popups require double confirmation instead...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Benoit Coeure, the head of France's competition authority, "told reporters the regulator had not spelled out how Apple should change its app, but that it was up to the company to make sure it now complied with the ruling,"Sounds like a good shakedown to me. Wait until they tweak it then fine them again for getting it “wrong”. I wonder if they even got the chance to change anything before they were fined the first time. And all because the regulator wants users to be advertised to more?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No good deed goes unpunished. Don't protect users' privacy, and you get flak from regulators for "not doing enough". Protect users' privacy, and you get flak from regulators because it's "too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue". You see similar levels of cynicism directed at Google. When firefox banned third party cookies, it was almost universally welcomed, but when Chrome does it the cynics come out and say how it's actually some sort dastardly ploy to cement their position in the ad market because third party adtech firms are disproportionately harmed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43537593</guid></item><item><title>25.

A Corp. can pay for an editor to create a comprehensive article on their standard which, even if it's objective, can influence more people into adopting the better documented option.Of course, this can happen even without paid editors being involved, and there's nothing stopping B Corp. from doing the same, but I just wanted to point out that avoiding bias might not be always easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While Oka itself claims to be free of the systematic bias of Wikipedia, how can you be so sure that Oka itself is not free of systematic bias, even if it tries to be as public and transparent as possible?So unfortunately, even if Oka claims to be doing for the good, I still see it somewhat as a political group, even if our values are aligned, and thus, "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If systemd is the reason, there are several good distros without systemd (I run Void Linux in particular).If "kubesomething" is the reason, there's no requirement to use it. I think most people don't run it on their home servers.If containers are the reason, then again, they are not a requirement. But they are pretty similar to BSD's jails. I don't think they are particularly complex.FreeBSD has a number of strong suits: ZFS, a different kernel and network stack, a cohesive system from a small(ish) team of authors, the handbook, etc. But the usual Linux hobgoblins listed above are a red herring here, to my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use FreeBSD for my home server and I have for years.  For me, the biggest reason is just the stability from a user perspective.  I don't mean system stability, although it has been rock solid, I mean the stability in terms of administration - the tools don't change frequently.`ifconfig` just works, like it has worked for 20 years.  On my linux servers, it's all swallowed into `ip addr` now.  I don't mind that, I certainly understand why these things change, but when I update an Ubuntu server I always worry that next time I log in a tool I am used to will be broken or removed.I simply don't have those concerns on FreeBSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ZFS is probably the biggest reason for me. I have a machine with a zfs pool running samba and nfsd.Philosophically I tend to prefer *BSDs over Linux. I have a few FreeBSD machines, one OpenBSD, and one Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534533</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every ISP should be required upon request to provide the necessary hardware to provide a single IP address on a single copper cable. If some dumb bozo wants to get the ISP deluxe package of gateway/router/DNS sniffer/shit-tier WiFi AP all rolled into one box, fine. The opt out should be as simple as “I have my own equipment, I understand that any support call with you will stop after a public IP is found to be working on premise, now get the hell out of my way thank you”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d note that (outside of Comcast possibly being mad at you breaking the modem), sometimes they push a bad update and you need to reset the modem, and last time I did that I needed to step through the initial setup on the WiFi network before activating bridge mode. So if the wifi hardware is broken you might need to jump through hoops to get through that setup (or swap the modem).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I doubt they'd find it - the SOP for issues with these modems must just be to replace them with a new one - something tells me Comcast wouldn't look kindly on physically modifying rental equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43527521</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the retirement of Ivan, a unique Terra Bus that served as a crucial mode of transportation in Antarctica, particularly for the research community and tourists. It highlights the history of the Terra Bus, its design adapted for the harsh Antarctic environment, and the role it played in facilitating exploration and research in one of the most remote areas on Earth. The piece captures the nostalgia associated with Ivan's retirement while celebrating its contributions to Antarctic adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

When confronted she refused to give it back, and the defendant forcibly retrieved it from her.Is there a name for this fever dream style of writing, that even if you follow up on all the loose ends dropped throughout, find that some of them evaporate under scrutiny?1. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stephen-tyler-bieneman-not-guil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You too can ride in such a vehicle - just visit the Columbia Icefield in Banff, Canada.https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/attractions/columbia-i...They drive out tourists on to the ice (as long as it is still there, couple decades left).I did it, very cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sad I won't get to ride Ivan when I (hopefully) go back to the ice this fall.

&lt;p&gt;The paper discusses advancements in machine learning, particularly focusing on the concept of neural networks and deep learning. It explores various methodologies and approaches used in training these models, emphasizing their applications across different domains including computer vision and natural language processing. The authors aim to provide insights into the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of these technologies, as well as the challenges faced in achieving efficient and accurate performance. Overall, the work contributes to the understanding of deep learning techniques and their potential for future developments in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this paper overestimates the benefit of what I call isoheaps (partitioning allocations by type). I wrote the WebKit isoheap implementation so it’s something I care about a lot.Isoheaps can make mostly neutralize use after free bugs. But that’s all they do.  Moreover they don’t scale well. If you isoheap a select set of stuff then it’s fine, but if you tried to deploy isoheaps to every allocation you get massive memory overhead (2x or more) and substantial time overhead too. I know because I tried that.If an attacker finds a type confusion or heap buffer overflow then isoheaps won’t prevent the attacker from controlling heap layout. All it takes is that they can confuse an int with a ptr and game over. If they can read ptr values as ints then they can figure out how the heap is laid out (no matter how weirdly you laid it out). If they also can write ptr values as ints then control they whole heap. At that point it doesn’t even matter if you have control flow integrity.To defeat attackers you really need some kind of 100% solution where you can prove that the attacker can’t use a bug with one pointer access to control the whole heap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short paper, so can be easily summarized. The claim is that security can be improved by these compiler and hardware assisted measures:    - Stack Integrity
    - Control-Flow Integrity
    - Heap Data Integrity
    - Pointer Integrity and Unforgeability

They cite the deployment of these measures on recent Apple hardware as evidence of their effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the cited paper:"These four types of integrity, do not establish memory safety, but merely attempt to contain the effects of its absence; therefore, attackers will still be able to change software behavior by corrupting memory."and the paper then goes on to say, about Apple's implementation of the cited techniques:"This intuition is borne out by experience: in part as a result of Apple’s deployment of these defenses since 2019, the incidence of RCE attacks on Apple client software has decreased significantly—despite strong attack pressure—and
the market value of such attacks risen sharply.""Decreased significantly" is not "eliminated"; indeed, you could paraphrase this as "the combination of these techniques has already been shown to be insufficient for security guarantees".Which is not to say that these mitigations are a bad idea; but I think their benefits are significantly over-sold in the paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532220</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a humorous account of debugging issues in the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software using a fax machine as a communication tool. It highlights how the author and their colleague navigated technical challenges in the software while relying on fax messages to relay information and generate fixes. The piece illustrates the quirks of working with outdated technology and the creativity required to resolve software bugs in a time before modern communication methods became widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Egg" is a short philosophical story that explores the concept of life, death, and reincarnation. The narrative follows a man who dies and encounters a divine entity, leading to a profound discussion about the nature of existence. He learns that he will be reborn repeatedly, experiencing life in various forms and eras, all with the aim of maturing spiritually and ultimately becoming a god-like figure. The story emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the cyclical nature of life, suggesting that every individual is part of a larger, infinite journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms of Service; Didn’t Read (ToS;DR) is a project that aims to simplify and evaluate the terms of service and privacy policies of various websites and online services. It categorizes them based on their user-friendliness and transparency, providing users with easy-to-understand summaries and ratings. The goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about the services they use by highlighting key aspects of terms and policies, such as user rights, data usage, and consent requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

Odd first impression.Wikipedia has 4 thumbs down 1 thumbs up and is grade B. Tor has 0 thumbs down 3 thumbs up and is grade C.DuckDuckGo has only 1 thumbs down: "Instead of asking directly, this Service will assume your consent merely from your usage." and is grade B, presumably because of this. Startpage is grade A, has no thumbs down, but going on startpage does not prompt me to agree to anything either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweet! One suggestion is to somehow normalize the requirements by company type? Like, for example, PayPal gets a thumbsdown for&gt; You must provide your identifiable informationbut that's reasonable for a company like PayPal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533096</guid></item><item><title>35.

How many are there? Starting at the beginning of written history ~5,200 years ago to ~2,000 years ago, how many texts do we have from each millenia or century? Are they accessible to be digitized?What about earlier symbols and similar potential communication? For example, caves sometimes have marks that seems to have some symbolic meaning, such as slashes that seem like counts.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the features and benefits of Kagi's Family Plan, which allows families to create individual accounts for each member, offering personalized settings and access. It emphasizes the inclusion of a dedicated Kids Login, designed to provide a safe and controlled browsing experience for children. Parents can manage and monitor their children's usage, ensuring a child-friendly environment while allowing access to appropriate content. The plan caters to the needs of families seeking to balance internet access among different age groups while maintaining security and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Kagi or anyone could work on, is an actually working version of YouTube Kids.I literally Pi-Hole Blocked all of YouTube after my son started reading the Bible after a Minecraft Influencer started preaching throughout most of his videos to the point my son became a bit too much interested in the topic.Not that I'm a rabid atheist or would deny my child such a thing, but if THAT can enter my 8yr olds brain via his short allowed time where he can browse by himself, i'm worried what else is coming his way through it.I'd love to give him access to valuable videos between rules I describe by natural language and can test myself, but nothing like this exists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; to ensure children are not exposed to harmful content.Strong claim. I like the idea, but wish they were more realistic about what they can provide. If you ever get a Reddit result you're likely one click away from harmful content.That said, I like the lenses applied in this case. It may be the best we can get today in terms of search filtering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kagi seems like a cool company - I'm not a customer yet. I'd like there to be technology companies I can trust - perhaps like Kagi.I have been really happy with NextDNS though. My kids, not so much. But hey ... that's parenting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538338</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The world gets both better and worse. it is something that I regularly get voted down for saying here, but IMO the west is unduly pessimist because it had a golden age from winning the cold war until the late 2000s, took an overly optimistic view of the future and the inevitability of progress (remember "the end of history") and cannot cope with things going back to normal.Things get better, sometimes they get worse. Generally people are better off materially than they have ever been, but people do not change all that much morally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; frightened into rationalityAn oxymoron if I ever heard one. To become rational means letting go of fears (to a large extent). I fear that one reason we fail to act is that we are guided by fear. Fear makes us focus on the wrong things. And I fear that in a civilized society fear becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Fear makes us obsess about the problem and how to avoid it in the very narrow and short term. It doesn't make us very good at long term planning and execution. It's an instinct that is evolved for animals that want to avoid predators, not for civilization builders.Building a civilization requires vision, big plans and the feeling that we can afford bold ideas. We need to take risks. But how can we take more risks when we're constantly afraid of the future? How can we build a better future when all we do all day is imagining the worst possible future? If our minds are constantly occupied by dystopia we can't plan for anything else.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the incident involving a Marine fighter jet that ejected over North Charleston. It details the circumstances of the ejection, the response from emergency services, and the safety measures in place for such situations. The piece highlights the significance of this event in relation to military operations and the impact on the local community, including any potential risks associated with military aircraft flying overhead. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the operations of military aircraft in civilian areas.&lt;/p&gt;

It's just the long known story: A pilot ejects from a malfunctioning (but likely flyable) jet, gets cleared in the first two investigations because most other pilots would have interpreted the situation similarly, promoted, and then fired less than 4 months after moving with his family to the location of his new role. It remains unclear why but scapegoating to distract from the plane's issues is commonly seen as the most likely explanation, with all the risks it entails (pilots becoming more hesitant to eject or openly admit mistakes so safety can be improved).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had one short sentence in there that he still had a tiny alternate primary flight display. Still had control surfaces. He knew he was descending and his authorized air space. Pull up, look at the pfd, do some resets, follow helmet malfunction protocols.There was very little about a devils advocate side to the story.I could imagine others joking about ejecting for minor warnings or trolling him. Especially in the marines.Do a FOIA on all ejections because his is just one. He had a good 27 year career and ended as a colonel with retirement benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531013</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;BrowserCraft is a platform that allows users to run legacy Java applications directly in their web browsers. It utilizes CheerpJ, a technology that compiles Java bytecode into JavaScript, thereby enabling seamless execution of older Java-based software without the need for plugins or additional installations. The site highlights the ease of use, compatibility with various web environments, and the benefits of modernizing applications by making them accessible through any standard web browser. It targets developers and organizations looking to preserve and transition their Java applications into a more accessible format.&lt;/p&gt;

  5ca1ab1e1 image_convolve: use thread pool for better performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After experimenting with cycling punctuation, and random capitalization I hit on the idea to use each word as a bit and map the original version of the word to 0 and the title-case-toggled version of the word to 1.Then just use the text file as a "counter nonce" and count from 0 until we find a counter that hashes to the vanity prefix we want.The advantage of this is flipping the capitalization of the first letter of each word doesn't drastically alter the visual appearance of the file (tho it may alter semantics!), and you get an easy to understand amount of entropy (number of states) to walk through.The C version linked only supports counting up to ~4 billion but it could be easily extended. A JS version using BigInt can go unlimited.For reference the included example text took a surprising 2 billion iterations to discover the correct 8 digit hash which is about what you'd expect from random (i.e., half the state space of 16*8 = (2*4)*8)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The SHA-256 hash of this sentence begins with 0573e7473.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503833</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of crate training in the context of programming, using the metaphor of taming mythical creatures like Tiamat and Cthulhu. It explores how the C++ programming language can be refined and organized using efficient management techniques, akin to training and controlling chaotic forces. The author emphasizes the importance of creating structured and usable libraries (or "crates") while managing complexity in C++. This approach aims to enhance productivity and reduce errors in software development, making powerful tools more approachable for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There isn't anything new here to defend against lifetime-related UB. For that it simply references https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21145, which is just a summary of existing dynamic mitigations --- which don't fix UB at the language level, impose performance tradeoffs, and in the case of pointer integrity, require hardware support that excludes e.g. x86.Look at it this way --- mature products like Chrome are already doing all of that wherever they can. If it was enough, they wouldn't worry about C++ UB anymore. But they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it is great that this is happening, it seems a bit getting too late to the party.There is also the whole issue that standard working group, and the folks that actually work on C and C++ compilers, nowadays it is a very thin Venn diagram for the intersection of both groups.So it remains to be seen how much of this will actually land on compilers, and in what form.Nevertheless there are many C++ written tools that most likely will never be rewritten into something else, so any improvement is welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In C, we made clear in C23 that there is no true time-travel UB and have eliminated about 30% of UB in the core language for C2Y as part of an ongoing effort that will eliminate most of the simple cases of UB. We also have plans to add opt-in memory safety mode proving full spatial and temporal memory safety.Having said this, I think the sudden and almost exclusive focus on memory safety is weird. As a long-term Linux user, this is not my main problem. This is what people building app stores and non-free content distribution systems need and they now re-engineer the world according to their needs. There are lot of things compromising my online safety and freedom, and certainly memory safety issues are not very high on this list.Finally, what Rust achieves, and what a memory-safe mode in C will hopefully also achieve in the future, is also just an incremental improvement. As long as there in unsafe code, and in practice there will be a lot of unsafe code, there is no perfect memory safety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531914</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;guMCP is a GitHub project that provides a Python library for a multi-criteria decision-making process, allowing users to evaluate and prioritize options based on multiple criteria efficiently. The library aims to streamline decision-making in various fields by implementing algorithms for decision analysis, particularly focusing on methods like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). It features various functionalities, including data input handling, decision matrix creation, and ranking outputs, and is intended for both individual users and developers looking to integrate decision-making capabilities into their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks HN! (cofounder here)Just a couple of things that I think makes GuMCP different than other options out there:- Having a unified way to run each server via stdio and sse. Basically all existing providers either let you connect through their hosted sse service or let you clone and run stdio locally. Rarely is there a very simple way to do either/or, especially when it comes to hosting your own sse server out-of-the-box. Existing options like Zapier's MCP are closed source, so it's not so simple.- Setting a flexible and generic framework for integration auth with MCP servers. Currently, methods of authentication vary from server to server. We provide a unified mechanism of auth for every single server that is importantly generic enough for you to be able to host it on your own. We do this through having a base 'AuthClient' that is used across each of our servers, which supports any arbitrary implementation. For local use, we provide a LocalAuthClient that sets a standard for integrations, OAuth and otherwise.- We also have a GumloopAuthClient that uses your existing credentials for Gumloop, which will then exact similarly to how Zapier or Composio do their MCP servers, with auth taken care of easily. Difference is you have the flexibility to also host it on your own with your own AuthClient, or run locally with stdio and local auth as well.- Ready-to-deploy sse through one URL. If you want to host on your own, the repository out-of-the box can be deployed with ALL sse servers hosted under a single URL.- For open source contributions, your server will be deployed and hosted instantly. No need to fiddle with devops to get a SSE server available remotely for your implementation. This makes it way simpler for less technical folks (or just those who don't want to deal with infra) to make their ideas a reality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone else hosting MCP servers in a generally available way? Seems like that's the end goal given the network transports (especially the one in new spec revision).Seems like everything I find requires running locally or hosting your own instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;very similar to my goals but i went different way.I chose wasm for package format. so everyone can choose the programming language they are familiar with. caveat: rust still has best support for wasm. everything else is hit or miss.I chose OCI registry for package publishing because that's what everyone already has in their infrastructure. or just use dockerhub/GHCR.https://github.com/tuananh/hyper-mcp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535889</guid></item><item><title>50.

But I guess that’s also the kind of person buying the £500 tshirts linked in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: the author here, Derek Guy, is the infamous (and brilliant) "Menswear Guy" on X.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Guyhttps://x.com/dieworkwear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Few years back, I thought it was wise to invest in some semi-pricey clothes which were intended to suite me for a while. The only formal stuff I had at the time was my Dad’s, or something I thrifted, which didn’t quite fit.Some pants, shirts, which I could put a jacket over for something more formal. Some shorts and shirts for the gym.Every single one of those pants ripped, to my surprise, because some of them were $150-$250. Some ripped in the belt loops, others between the legs. The dress shirt is barely holding up, there are little plumes of ripped material on the side.Each time they ripped, I replaced them with something I found for $15-35 at Target. Not a single rip.I still keep the dress shirt, because it’s the only one I have, and I’m not at all sure what to replace it with.I dislike the shirts that Target sells because the frame they use is of a long, skinny man, with small arms, and an extremely wide neck. Not sure how the fuck that happened. But the material is perfectly fine.If anyone knows where I can find a nice shirt (both collared and others for the gym), that’d be great. I’m set on target pants, though. They are indestructible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43528496</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every perf guide recommends to minimize allocations to reduce GC times, but if you look at pprof of a Go app, GC mark phase is what takes time, not GC sweep. GC mark always starts with known live roots (goroutine stacks, globals, etc) and traverse references from there colouring every pointer. To minimize GC time it is best to avoid _long living_ allocations. Short lived allocations, those which GC mark phase will never reach, has almost neglible effect on GC times.Allocations of any kind have an effect on triggering GC earlier, but in real apps it is almost hopeless to avoid GC, except for very carefully written programs with no dependenciesm, and if GC happens, then reducing GC mark times gives bigger bang for the buck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking out the first example—object pools—I was initially blown away that this is not only possible but it produces no warnings of any kind:    pool := sync.Pool{
        New: func() any { return 42 }
    }

    a := pool.Get()

    pool.Put("hello")
    pool.Put(struct{}{})

    b := pool.Get()
    c := pool.Get()
    d := pool.Get()

    fmt.Println(a, b, c, d)

Of course, the answer is that this API existed before generics so it just takes and returns `any` (née `interface{}`). It just feels as though golang might be strongly typed in principle, but in practice there are APIs left and rigth that escape out of the type system and lose all of the actual benefits of having it in the first place.Is a type system all that helpful if you have to keep turning it off any time you want to do something even slightly interesting?Also I can't help but notice that there's no API to reset values to some initialized default. Shouldn't there be some sort of (perhaps optional) `Clear` callback that resets values back to a sane default, rather than forcing every caller to remember to do so themselves?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calling mmap “zero copy” is generous. I guess we glaze over the whole page fault thing, or the fact that performance is heavily dependent on how much memory pressure the process is under.This is the same n00b trap that derailed the llama.cpp project last year because people don’t understand how memory maps and paging works, and the tradeoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43539585</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my Core Memories when it comes to science, science education, and education in general was in my high school physics class, where we had to do an experiment to determine the gravitational acceleration of Earth. This was done via the following mechanism: Roll a ball off of a standard classroom table. Use a 1990s wristwatch's stopwatch mechanism to start the clock when the ball rolls of the table. Stop the stopwatch when the ball hits the floor.Anyone who has ever had a wristwatch of similar tech should know how hard it is to get anything like precision out of those things. It's a millimeter sized button with a millimeter depth of press and could easily need half a second of jabbing at it to get it to trigger. It's for measuring your mile times in minutes, not fractions of a second fall times.Naturally, our data was total, utter crap. Any sensible analysis would have error bars that, if you treat the problem linearly, would have put 0 and negative numbers within our error bars. I dutifully crunched the numbers and determined that the gravitational constant was something like 6.8m/s^2 and turned it in.Naturally, I got a failing grade, because that's not particularly close, and no matter how many times you are solemnly assured otherwise, you are never graded on whether you did your best and honestly report what you observe. From grade school on, you are graded on whether or not the grading authority likes the results you got. You might hope that there comes some point in your career where that stops being the case, but as near as I can tell, it literally never does. Right on up to professorships, this is how science really works.The lesson is taught early and often. It often sort of baffles me when other people are baffled at how often this happens in science, because it more-or-less always happens. Science proceeds despite this, not because of it.(But jerf, my teacher... Yes, you had a wonderful teacher who didn't only give you an A for the equivalent but called you out in class for your honesty and I dunno, flunked everyone who claimed they got the supposed "correct" answer to three significant digits because that was impossible. There are a few shining lights in the field and I would never dream of denying that. Now tell me how that idealism worked for you going forward the next several years.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this in 1999 when entering university. It was so refreshing hearing a student provide a glimpse into the boots-on-the-ground reality of undergrad life at these world-renowned institution.The closing sentence is also prescient; the author pivoted to CS, ultimately completing his doctorate at the University of Wisconsin at Madisonhttps://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kovar/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I TAd a semiconductor fabrication lab class 20-odd years ago.  Mostly it was about making sure the students had the absolute fear of God put into them about working with HF, but there was also a bit at the end where you actually got to do a voltage sweep and characterize your transistor. If in fact you had made a transistor rather than a needlessly complicated resistor. The other TAs and I passed this paper around and thought it was just hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43545917</guid></item><item><title>3.

How well it achieved that goal is, of course, debatable, but it has survived nearly a century in that form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love The Guardian! It is one of my two ongoing donations, along with the Internet Archive.Back when it was The Manchester Guardian, they produced one of the most remarkable TV commercials in history, "Points of View":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsccRkLLzUI first saw this commercial when Will Hearst (yes, of that Hearst family) screened it at a Software Development Forum meeting in the late 1980s.I wish this were a better transfer, but it is what we have.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello! I am the one behind this app. A friend who thinks I am not promoting it enough submitted it to HN (not complaining at all, thanks Aditya!).I had also posted on the "What are you working on?" thread yesterday - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531684.Happy to answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! I guess there needs to be a way for people to share new lessons to practise, it gets complicated with copyright pretty fast.For real "lessons" you'd probably need to start at chord progressions, go into scales and how the chords relate back to those, then move to these types of soloing technique lessons.AlphaTab is the star here https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab - it's been maintained tirelessly for years by Daniel Kuschny.I've started to build this type of lessons sitea few times in the past and never really got it together enough to release anything. I've done scale/chord/arpeggio tools: https://github.com/webprofusion/scalex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome!
I made a very similar tool to help myself practice progressions specifically for banjo: https://banjo-rolls-deluxe.twait.dev/Far fewer features than your app, but just having a tool to help nail down the muscle memory of pre-built progressions has been massively helpful for me as a banjo-player-in-training.Your exercise builder is awesome and something I was planning on building into my site, might take some inspo!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512470</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see a lot of people angry at "Nue" in various ways, and I can't help but think these are people heavily relying on React and missing the overall issue. The issue is that these huge frameworks have made the web a horrible slow mess. I deal as DevOps/SRE daily with these services, and finding one that will do a first load under 10s is close to impossible. When a simple home page dashboard or a notes page takes more than 10s to load on a 10G connection peered within 5ms of the host, and 95% of this is spent in JS, that's when you know the typical current webapp has reached a massive state of bloat only supported by fast browser engine, and people not having expectations.I'm not hopefully Nue would revolutionize this since there are plethora of Web SaaS companies just wanting to use "common" frameworks...  but I can at least root for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what they're replacing react with: https://nuejs.org/docs/view.htmlIt's an untyped view layer kind of along the lines of early angular 2.0.The model files are plain javascript.So no typings anywhere. Which is fine, I guess this is targeting the vuejs crowd. Maybe their marketing should pivot a little bit in that direction, most react people now use TypeScript because first class types in your view layer are super useful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. But I went for Svelte. Invested in Svelte and SvelteKit. Wrote a decent sized app (not toy example, pretty feature right, tens of forms and screens if you will) and later I looked back at React.And I discovered that:  - React is not that hard if you understand the hooks.

  - React is lightweight too. For my use case at least.

  - React is boring technology at this point which is good.

  - The ecosystem is huge. You cannot have React Query like library and that's just one example.

So I'm sticking to React for next few years especially when the React compiler is already being used inside Facebook and Instagram and released as public beta.Even React Native supports React compiler and I don't see this support going away rather getting better.PS Edit: React compiler leaves not much for runes in Svelte or its compiled nature. I don't like Svelte much after runes because it feels like you're not writing Javascript rather a notation that looks like Javascript. Post React compiler, much of the hooks hell is not needed in complex scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543241</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One more thing, just in general: Some people are complaining that some languages work better than others.  This seems to be a common issue now with the availability of AI (both voice recognition and LLMs): there's a temptation to expand into as many languages as possible, simply because you can.My advice would be to have languages default to an "alpha" state, and only progress them to "beta" and "1.0" state when they reach certain milestones, as defined by community feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd straight up pay 5 or 10 bucks a month for this if it was like... 200% more functional/featured/professional/working. VERY good proof of concept and I love it. Target language is german fwiw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've checked out the Japanese one, but I'd say that it's definitely no where near "real-world content" IMO. Just the usual tortuously slow-paced, artificially dumbed-down dialogue you'd expect out of classroom recordings.Most of the videos also contain subtitles, which defeats the purpose of the exercises (you can disable the video manually though). Another issue is that some of the words are segmented very unnaturally (e.g. [み][ません]), so it's unclear how you're expected to fill them in.In the end if what you really want is "real-world content", then you just need to go out there and find them yourselves - they're everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543235</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of excitable cells, specifically focusing on their role in generating action potentials and facilitating communication within the nervous system and muscle tissues. It explains how these cells respond to stimuli, the mechanisms behind their excitability, and the importance of ion channels in regulating their activity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have frequent ectopic beats that I feel as a flutter / heavy beat on my chest. The doc says it won't kill me but it is extremely uncomfortable at times. This has been a great material to learn about the inner workings of heart cells.BTW Here's an ECG from my Apple Watch showing 3 such beats (you can't miss them): https://link.ekin.dev/l1Vc3GdfIf you happen to have these, just get checked out by a cardiologist. They are almost always benign but the frequency / daily amount are reasons for concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exciting simulations! :) And an excellent explanation.From time to time I get episodes of sudden tachycardia¹. It's a very strange feeling: one second everything is fine, the next my heart jumps in my throat and starts beating at 230 bpm (not a typo). After a while, just as quickly as it came, the tachycardia goes away and I'm back at whatever HR I was before the trigger. If it doesn't go away by itself, breathing in deep and holding my breath typically does the trick. It's like a light switch! A bit scary, but also very fascinating.Thanks for explaining so well what goes on "under the hood"!¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_supraventricular_ta..., I believe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you for all the kind responses.I also want to make a similar article, where I calculate an ECG for the simulation, and then make and explain the changes necessary to make the ECG look realistic. A main challenge will be that the depolarization has to happen very fast relative to the repolarization, which may be computationally difficult for a cell-based simulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504940</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;KOReader is an amazing program that has progressed at amazing speed over the past few years, particularly when it comes to the user interface. (It can still be overwhelming, because of the sheer number of features, but it is much better organized.)To give you an idea of how different it is from commercial products: it actually tracks reading in a useful way. It shows a chart of how long you have spent on each page, so you can figure out which parts of a book you have not yet read. That is really useful when jumping around technical books. If you are interested in tracking your general reading habits, there are handy views that shows which books you have read and when you read them (either by time of day or across a month).As for reading PDFs, well, eInk has its limitations and KOReader does it's best to work around them. If you want to read a multicolumn paper on a small screen, you can configure it to go down one column then right back to the top of the next column. If you want there to be overlap between the screens when panning, you can configure that. You can also have it display which parts were overlapping, so you don't get lost when it displays the next part.There is tonnes of other stuff in there. I just mentioned those two because I use them the most. Overall I would say it feels like KOReader was designed by people who want an amazing reading experience, rather than by people trying to sell novels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very impressive how the almost the entire application is written in lua(JIT). Particularly impressive how it is fast enough to do CPU blitting/blending[0]I wonder why is lua so rarely utilized like this on its own. Such a neat language.[0]: https://github.com/koreader/koreader-base/blob/master/ffi/bl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely love KOReader. I use it on my Kindle 3 and have moved my parents and brother over to using it on their Kindles as well.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a famous April Fools' joke that occurred in 1957 when the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) aired a segment about spaghetti trees in Switzerland, showcasing a family supposedly harvesting spaghetti from trees. Many viewers believed the broadcast, leading to a flood of inquiries about how to grow spaghetti plants. The piece explores the cultural impact of the prank, highlighting how it reflects the gullibility of the public and the influence of media. It also examines the joke's lasting legacy in the realm of pranks and media manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In high school, we had a Netware 3.12 environment, and the Guest account was enabled, albeit with very limited privileges. But for some reason, Guest could still use NET SEND, which popped up a little message in the bottom row of the destination machine's display.The whole district shared a T1 connection to the internet. Which was more than plenty for email, but as this world-wide-web thing started gaining traction, it became quite the bottleneck. And as some of us had discovered mp3 files, the slowness simply would not do.One day there was some severe weather and a power hiccup during school hours, and every station got a message from ADMIN informing us that the server room was running on UPS power and we should save our files and log out immediately.Hmmmm.A few weeks later, one of the bright sparks in the technology program realized that having everyone log off would free up some bandwidth. So he logged onto the next machine over as GUEST, and used a NET SEND ALL "SERVER ROOM POWER FAILURE - 11 MIN OF BATTERY REMAIN - SAVE FILES AND LOG OFF" and sure enough, within about a minute, the whole T1 was his. Did what he needed to do (i.e. leeching an entire fserv) for about 8 minutes, then NET SEND ALL "POWER RESTORED - RESUME YOUR WORK".A few weeks later some hot commodity had just dropped and he repeated the drill. It still worked.Nobody noticed that these messages came from GUEST, even the district administrator, who eventually called an electrical contractor to figure out why the power in the server room was so flaky. Someone eventually pointed it out to him, which got a very red-faced "that's really clever but please knock it off", and no further punishment. The next day, the Guest account had a lot fewer privileges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the real value in this writeup up of a clever little prank is the way the author/prankster could map out the social reactions and how the spirit in which the prank was received cascades through a whole entire organization in ways that hinge on little cues, little things about who knows who and whether you're physically present before a particular impression crystallizes in people's minds.It's just such a great example of how people could react either with uproarious laughter or by feeling that some boundary has been violated and can think that either reaction was the most self-evidently obvious one in the world and the reasons for it were entirely contingent. It's something where you can only really witness the irrationality of it if you're in the author's position.I once heard it speculated that philosophy might have emerged in Greece because the circumstances of being merchants engaging in interstate trade, you could see the way that certain things regarded as received knowledge were really customs, peculiar to certain cultures and locations. When you're the prankster and you can see different people reacting in different ways that seem to be tied to patterns of the circumstances of how they experienced it, you can kind of witness the contingency of those reactions playing out in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At my very first real job, back in 1997-98, I worked in tech support for an insurance company. We used Lotus Notes for email (initially just internally, with no Internet email). I had programmer access to Notes because I built some forms for user requests (Notes was more than email, it also had forms, a whole programming language, workflows, etc.).Some Fridays (once a month?) were casual dress days where you could wear jeans instead of slacks (this was the distant past, when most professional workplaces still had real dress codes). This was an IT/Eng-wide thing, so we'd get an email reminder about this from an admin person in the department.One time, I thought it would be funny to send my own email announcing pants-less Friday. So I took a copy of the email this admin sent and adjusted it accordingly. I did of course specify that you still had to wear underwear. I'm not a monster. Because I had programmer privileges in Notes, I was able to forge the sender so that it appeared to come from the department admin person, not me.I _meant_ to send it to the small email group for just the other tech support folks (around 15 people or so). But I accidentally (?) sent it to all of IT/Eng, around 200-300 people, IIRC. Oops.Needless to say, my boss's phone started ringing off the hook. I immediately went over to tell him what I'd done. He wasn't pleased, but I didn't get fired. I did have to write an apology email.Of course, many folks in the department later told me it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen happen.Soon after, I moved to programming at a different company. I think this was a good thing for many reasons, but one reason is that it was more challenging, so I wasn't bored with time on my hands to do stupid things like send prank emails to my coworkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543743</guid></item><item><title>11.

This task, which likely required a great deal of manual labor and technical knowledge, was key to making the system work effectively and sustainably.This kind of thing is cool as a passion project, but it really just highlights how efficient the modern supply chain is. If you have the skills of a professional electrician, you too can spend hundreds of hours building a home battery system you could just buy for $20k, but is less reliable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I made 14 kWh more during lockdown"https://secondlifestorage.com/index.php?threads/glubuxs-powe...^ has a wild picture of full setup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's all fun and games until one of those thousand batteries decides to go exothermic :-). This is a really amazing story and I'm impressed by the diligence and amount of effort they put into recovering and reusing all of these batteries. A couple of dendrites though, a lightning strike, there are things outside of their control that could turn the building holding this collection of batteries into a very impressive incendiary device. If you've ever seen a fire at a battery factory, it is both fascinating and scary af. People are still trying to assess the long term damage from the Moss Landing grid scale battery fire in California.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43548217</guid></item><item><title>12.

   - I wonder if there will be a free tier, since my video needs are modest

It never occurred to me until I reached the end that this wasn't a "enjoy this tool we made" post, but instead a "look how awesome we are" post. :-/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was reading about the cinematography of _Collateral_, possibly the first large budget feature film to be shot digitally, and one of the issues back in 2004 when it was made was the amount of storage required for digital video and the risk of not being able to retrieve the images from the data stores:&gt; “We did massive testing with the hard drives, and everything was great, and then we had an experience where we shot, and when we sent in the material, they couldn’t get the information off the hard drive,” said Cameron. “So the studio went ballistic and was like, ‘There’s just no way we can we can let you guys do this.’”&gt; The compromise was the production would record to hard drives as well as SRW tape. And unlike today, verifying the digital footage was equally cumbersome and tension-filled.&gt; “We recorded everything two or three times on decks that we carried with us,” said Beebe. “So we were backing up, two or three times.”https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/michael-mann-c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Netflix has been spinning up ingest centers around the world, where drives can be dropped off, and within a matter of hours, all original camera files are uploaded into the Netflix ecosystem.Netflix is looking to sell shovels to as many people as possible, it seems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43541759</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've noticed that the formalization of methods described by AWS parallels what we need in technical documentation. Complex systems require not just formal verification but also structured documentation following MECE principles (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).In my experience, the interfaces between components (where most errors occur) are exactly where fragmented documentation fails. I implemented a hierarchical documentation system for my team that organizes knowledge as a conceptual tree, and the accuracy of code generation with AI assistants improved notably.Formal verification tools and structured documentation are complementary: verification ensures algorithmic correctness while MECE documentation guarantees conceptual and contextual correctness. I wonder if AWS has experimented with structured documentation systems specifically for AI, or if this remains an area to explore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A key concern I've consistently had regarding formal verification systems is: how does one confirm the accuracy of the verifier itself?This issue appears to present an intrinsically unsolvable problem, implying that a formally verified system could still contain bugs due to potential issues in the verification software.While this perspective doesn't necessarily render formal verification impractical, it does introduce certain caveats that, in my experience, are not frequently addressed in discussions about these systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leslie Lamport gave the closing keynote at SCaLE 22x this year, talking about formal methods and TLA+. He mentioned some previous work Amazon has done in that area.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsSDvflzJbc&gt; Coding isn't Programming - Closing Keynote with Leslie Lamport - SCaLE 22x&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43547593</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;CERN scientists have discovered evidence of quantum entanglement in sheep, marking a significant breakthrough in the understanding of quantum mechanics and its implications for biological systems. The research demonstrates that quantum entanglement is not solely confined to atomic or subatomic particles but may also occur in larger biological entities. This finding opens new avenues for exploring the role of quantum phenomena in living organisms and poses intriguing questions about the intersection of quantum physics and life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

This is common knowledge for anyone who's ever interacted with sheep on a farm, in their natural, fermionic superfluid state. If you turn over a sheep and tickle its ticklish underbelly, you get a sheep-laugh (a hilarious sound) only about 50% of the time; the other 50%, you'll hear a sheep laughing from the opposite end of the meadow. Because, you cannot definitively say if it was *this* sheep you tickled, or *that* other, identical one. They are indistinguishable baa-tickles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, I see it's useless internet day, catch you all tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; set the baa for a new branch of quantum physicsI'll admit I got a few paragraphs in before that made it click.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43545349</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The Unattend Generator is a tool designed to create customized Windows unattended installation files (unattend.xml). It simplifies the setup process by allowing users to configure various installation options through a user-friendly interface, enabling the automation of Windows installations without manual intervention. The generator supports multiple versions of Windows and includes features for customizing user accounts, network settings, and system preferences, making it a valuable resource for IT professionals and system administrators looking to streamline their deployment workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite trick is to install with English (World) language to avoid auto-install of all sorts of crap. Windows Store won't work in this mode, but it's just a matter of reverting to your preferred language after first boot.https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/15gk07n/english_...Edit: in my experience, changing the language to something else immediately after install is done still adds the crapware automatically. I think I needed to reboot once or twice for whatever post-install service Windows runs to no longer get executed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since i‘ve been doing this sort of thing for many years here are some basic rules:
- Get LTSC (W10) or IoT/Enterprise (W11) images to begin with
- Get https://www.ntlite.com/ .. you won‘t find any other tool which does a better job at removing packages, adding drivers, etc. Worth every penny with great support.
- Use GroupPolicies to configure your system. Take the time and download them for Office, Edge, Chrome, Firefox and update those that come with Windows.
- Integrate drivers not only for the base image but also in the recovery and setup image.
- Install a firewall (binisoft is fine)
- Use NextDNS
- If you don’t mind the security implications: Disable Defender, SmartScreen, BootGuard and VBS (use bcdedit)
- Disable Microcode loading (delete the DLL)
- Disable Spectre/Meltdown mitigations
- If you need Office: Use the LTSC versionMost third party tools are outdated or do stupid stuff which isn’t needed. You can silence Windows with the right GroupPolicies quite easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The level of workarounds that windows requires never cease to amaze me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518570</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "toposort" presents an implementation of a topological sorting algorithm, which is used to order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear sequence based on their dependencies. The repository provides detailed documentation, usage instructions, and examples to help users integrate the algorithm into their projects. The code is available in multiple programming languages, and contributions from the community are encouraged to enhance and improve the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For something like task scheduling in a build system, if you use an up-front partition of the tasks like this, you may have a task that has all its dependencies fulfilled because tasks may have different durations, but still remains unscheduled.For example, with this input:    $ cat data.file
    root: parentA parentB
    parentA: C D
    parentB: E F

Asking the package tool for the sorted sets gives me:    $ ./zig-out/bin/toposort-cli --data data.file
    Processing succeeded.
      Topologically sorted sets: [ { C D E F }  { parentA parentB }  { root }  ]
      Topologically sorted list: [ C D E F parentA parentB root ]
      Nodes: [ root parentA parentB C D E F ]
      Dependency tree:
      [ C D E F ]
        C -&gt; [ parentA ]
          parentA -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        D -&gt; [ parentA ]
          parentA -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        E -&gt; [ parentB ]
          parentB -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        F -&gt; [ parentB ]
          parentB -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        
If we follow the README's advice to parallel process set-by-set, we can easily have starvation: once `C` and `D` are finished, we are ready to start `parentA`, even if E and F are still work-in-progress.How would I use the API of this package to detect and start the task `parentA` as soon as `C` and `D` are finished? I guess when a task is finished, I can ask for the list of dependent tasks, and for each of them, check if all of their dependencies are finished, and if so start the task. But this real-world need feels un-met; it feels odd to me to focus on the sorted sets instead of more practical scheduling.That is kind of doing Kahn's algorithm iteratively during the build. It would be cool to try and optimize that for maximum performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been enjoying zig myself quite a bit, I'm fairly confident I could do some larger projects in it (excluding comptime since it's missing features I sorely need for some of my current projects.) I like it a bit more than C/C++ in a lot of cases, I need it to be pushed just a tiny bit further before I can really dedicate effort towards large projects in it. I was even curious if I could implement the features I need myself (there is even a proposal already), but got the answer "Just don't." (I don't blame andrew, he already has a lot on his plate and I'm a stranger to him.) So I'm at the point of either waiting for the feature or forking it, haven't decided what I'm going to do though.More on topic for the project though, did you have any project ideas for this? I think I could use this for my opencv node editor, I just did the naive method of marking all outputs dirty as their inputs nodes got reprocessed. I assume this would fix the potential problem of recomputing a node twice? I also see you mention "Cycle detection and cycle reporting." but what specifically happens if I do have a cycle? Does it just give up or is it something like best effort?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that have not implemented toposort or don't remember it: 1) only directed graphs without cycles can be topologically sorted (DAGs) 2) there can be more than one topological order and 2) reverse post order of depth first traversal from every unvisited node shields a topological order.In JavaScript:    function toposort(graph = { a: ['b', 'c'], b: ['d'] }) {
      const order = [];
      const visited = new Map();
      
      function dfs(node) {
        const status = visited.get(node);

        if (status === 1) throw new Error("Cycle found.");
        if (status === 2) return;

        visited.set(node, 1); // In progress.
        const adjacent = graph[node] ?? [];
        for (const neighbor of adjacent) dfs(neighbor);
        visited.set(node, 2); // Done.

        order.unshift(node); // Reverse post order.
      }

      for (const node in graph) {
        if (!visited.has(node)) dfs(node);

&lt;p&gt;The Ruby UI project on GitHub is a library designed to facilitate the creation of user interfaces in Ruby applications. It aims to provide a cohesive set of tools and components for developers to build responsive, visually appealing UIs efficiently. The repository includes documentation, examples, and guidelines to assist users in implementing the library in their projects, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community. Overall, it serves as a resource for Ruby developers looking to enhance their UI design capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just curious why the decision was made to go with PascalCase for the DSL? Is this meant to help React devs feel at home? Seems very un-Rubylike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phlex is an amazing project. Makes frontend fun again. I've built my own UI library using DaisyUI and Tailwindcss that we use in all our Rails projects: https://github.com/inhouse-work/protosIt cannot be overstated how nice it is to move away from erb and into pure ruby. Private methods as partials is a game changer for refactoring your UI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used a rendering library like Phlex back in 2010. I hated it back then and I still don’t like it.They claim it’s faster than ERB but only show micro benchmarks. This is basically a form of lying.This approach stinks for a lot of reasons:- it adds a ton of pressure on the garbage collector.
- the backtraces suck to debug. Ruby is better now than in 2010, but it’s still lame.
- your templates are largely static. Yet when it lives as code you can’t cache any of it. An efficient ERB generator is just cached strings concatenations. Very efficient in Ruby.Finally, Rubyists hate this and it’s why the community is slowly dying. Almost all your frontend should be in JS/JSX at this point. Even the static stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43548108</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a critical evaluation of conversational interfaces, arguing that they often fail to enhance user experience and can lead to frustration. It highlights several shortcomings, including limitations in understanding natural language, the potential for miscommunication, and the increased cognitive load on users. The author suggests that while conversational interfaces may seem appealing, they frequently do not meet the practical needs of users and may be more of a hindrance than a help. The piece advocates for a careful consideration of when and how to implement such technologies in design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43542131"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This clearly elucidated a number of things I've tried to explain to people who are so excited about "conversations" with computers. The example I've used (with varying levels of effectiveness) was to get someone to think about driving their car by only talking to it. Not a self driving car that does the driving for you, but telling it things like: turn, accelerate, stop, slow down, speed up, put on the blinker, turn off the blinker, etc. It would be annoying and painful and you couldn't talk to your passenger while you were "driving" because that might make the car do something weird. My point, and I think it was the author's as well, is that you aren't "conversing" with your computer, you are making it do what you want. There are simpler, faster, and more effective ways to do that then to talk at it with natural language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's where the article goes wrong:1. "Natural language is a data transfer mechanism"2.  "Data transfer mechanisms have two critical factors: speed and lossiness"3. "Natural language has neither"While a conversational interface does transfer information, its main qualities are what I always refer to as "blissfull ignorance" and "intelligent interpretation".Blisfull ignorance allows the requester to state an objective while not being required to know or even be right in how to achieve it. It is the opposite of operational command. Do as I mean, not as I say."Intelligent Interpretation" allows the receiver the freedom to infer an intention in the communication rather than a command. It also allows for contextual interactions such as goal oriented partial clarification and elaboration.The more capable of intelligent interpretation the request execution system is, the more appropriate a conversational interface will be.Think of it as managing a team. If they are junior, inexperienced and not very bright, you will probably tend towards handholding, microtasking and micromanagement to get things done. If you have a team of senior, experienced and bright engineers, you can with a few words point out a desire and, trust them to ask for information when there is relevant ambiguity, and expect a good outcome without having to detail manage every minute of their days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Star Trek continues to be prescient. It not only introduced the conversational interface to the masses, it also nailed its proper uses in ways we're still (re)discovering now.If you pay attention to how the voice interface is used in Star Trek (TNG and upwards), it's basically exactly what the article is saying - it complements manual inputs and works as a secondary channel. Nobody is trying to manually navigate the ship by voicing out specific control inputs, or in the midst of a battle, call out "computer, fire photon torpedoes" - that's what the consoles are for (and there are consoles everywhere). Voice interface is secondary - used for delegation, queries (that may be faster to say than type), casual location-independent use (lights, music; they didn't think of kitchen timers, though (then again, replicators)), brainstorming, etc.Yes, this is a fictional show and the real reason for voice interactions was to make it a form of exposition, yadda yadda - but I'd like to think that all those people writing the script, testing it, acting and shooting it, were in perfect position to tell which voice interactions made sense and which didn't: they'd know what feels awkward or nonsensical when acting, or what comes off this way when watching it later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43542131</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advantages of using F#, a functional-first programming language. It highlights F#'s strong type system, expressiveness, and conciseness, which enable developers to write more reliable and maintainable code. The author emphasizes F#'s interoperability with .NET, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including data science and web development. Additionally, the article argues that F# promotes a functional programming paradigm that can lead to better problem-solving and increased productivity for developers familiar with its concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;F# was for me the best functional language when I looked at rewriting a Ruby on Rails app.
I wanted to go with a functional language, as it seems to better fit my thinking and reasoning, and I looked at Haskell, Ocaml, Scala, F#.Being a stranger to Microsoft technologies, F# was the least likely to be chosen, but easily became the first choice.
Haskell's purity made it hard to adopt (for me), Ocaml's ecosystem is subpar (there wasn't even a clear choice for a library to interact with postgresql, I couldn't install the latest version due to its reliance on an obscure tool whose name I forgot and didn't get help on the forum), and Scala is seems complex....F# was surprisingly easy to get started with. The community is mis-managed by a corporate-minded approach (requiring people to become member of the F# software foundation to get access to the official slack!), but its members are friendly, smart and ready to help. The ecosystem is great with access to all the dotnet libraries (some complain there's a mismatch as most of those are developed for use with C#, but I rarely got in trouble for using them).There are also great libs and frameworks available. Like https://github.com/SchlenkR/FsHttp to easily interact with http servers, to the point that I find it easier to use than a dedicated library. Or https://github.com/CaptnCodr/Fli , to run commands. And last but not least, https://www.websharper.com/ is the best web framework I have encountered across all ecosystems. Their reactive approach to web ui really allows me to develop complex interfaces in a maintainable way.This became a longer message than I thought, probably due to my enthousiasm for the language. For complete transparency, the situation is not perfect, and in my experience the tooling is not the best.If you want more info, I blogged about it a couple of months ago: https://www.asfaload.com/blog/consider-fsharp/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did try F#, but I was new to .NET ecosystem. For 1 "hello world" I was quite surprised by how many project files and boilerplate was generated by .NET, which put me off.I am all for FP, immutable, and modern languages. But then where are the jobs and which companies care if you write good code?Now everyone wants languages which are easy to use with AI, while reducing workforce and "increased productivity". I have been programming for 20 years and know 4-5 languages, in India it was worse but in EU at-least I can make a sustainable living by writing Java / TypeScript. I cannot even find jobs with Kotlin + TypeScript which pay well, forget getting jobs in Elixir / Clojure / F# (there maybe a handful of opportunities if I will relocate for around 70K/year). That is why I have mostly given up on learning niche languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm completely convinced that F# (along with Scala, Haskell, and OCaml) adoption has stalled due to having ridiculously bad build systems. More significantly, they are being passed up in favor of Rust, which is a great language but nonetheless a bad fit for a lot of problem domains, simply because Rust has a superior build system. Hell, 80% of the reason I choose Rust over C++ for embedded work is because of the build system.It baffles me that there are languages with non-profit foundations and are financially backed by multiple corporations which still have bad build systems. It is the most important investment you can make into a programming language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43546004</guid></item><item><title>23.

You can see our program highlight the dots as we reconstruct the shredded docs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzZDhyrjdVo
Thanks to that, we were able to win by a large margin. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had the experience of poking at tracking dots recently for circumstances I won't share here.Do y'allself a favor and get a blue LED flashlight and point it at a color print. It's shocking how many  are printed. It looks like a spattering of sand across the entire page!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; My printer does not print tracking dots. Can I hide this fact?&gt; If there are really no tracking dots, you can either create your own ones (deda_create_dots) or print the calibration page (deda_anonmask_create -w) with another printer and use the mask for your own printerThe thought of being able to “spoof” the tracking dots of another printer has interesting implications for deniability. Though I guess in this case you’d still need access to the original printer to print the anonmask…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551397</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see some workflow engine action on Hacker News! :-)I'm currently building pgflow, which is a simple, postgres-first engine that uses task queues to perform real work.Have explicit DAG approach, strong typesafety, nice DSL in TypeScript and a dedicated task queue worker that allows it to run solely on Supabase without any external tools.I'm super close to the alpha release, if you guys want more info, check out the readme for SQL core (https://github.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/tree/main/pkgs/core#rea...) or my Twitter (https://x.com/pgflow_dev).Hope that grabs someone attention :-)
Cheers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is really cool!That said, my impression is that Airflow is a really dated choice for a greenfield project. There isn't a clear successor though. I looked into this recently, and was quickly overwhelmed by Prefect, Dagster, Temporal, and even newer ones like Hatchet and HamiltonMost of these frameworks now have docs / plugins / sister libraries geared around AI agentsIt would be really helpful to read a good technical blog doing a landscape of design patterns in these different approaches, and thoughts on how to fit things together well into a pipeline given various quirks of LLMs (e.g. nondeterminism).This page is a good start, even if it is written as an airflow-specific how-to!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Truthfully have been a little skeptical of how many workloads will actually need “agents” vs doing something totally deterministic with a little LLM augmentation. Seems like I’m not the only one that thinks the latter works a lot of the time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538164</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a bit confused. I thought the main selling point of Tauri was that it uses the OS’s native WebView to create lighter apps compared to something like Electron. So why would I want to bundle a Servo or Verso? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of Tauri?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don’t know, Tauri is a lightweight electron alternative which doesn’t bundle browser nor a nodejs-like runtime.To me piggybacking on the system webview is the main selling point. Tauri-made bundles usually clock in at a few MBs, compared to 100+ with electron.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago I saw someone mention that Tauri would soon also just include Chromium, because in practice using a native webview loses a lot of the ostensible portability of a browser-in-a-desktop app (they claimed native webviews can differ a lot between OS's). Maybe that was overly pessimistic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518462</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the U.S. Marines' adoption of SeaGlider technology for rescue operations. SeaGliders are autonomous underwater vehicles designed to enhance maritime rescue capabilities by conducting search missions in various ocean conditions. The deployment of these innovative unmanned systems aims to improve operational efficiency, enhance safety for personnel, and facilitate quicker response times during emergencies at sea. The article highlights the potential impact of this technology on military and humanitarian missions, showcasing the evolving role of autonomous systems in modern warfare and disaster response.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ha, I love the "rescue ops".This will not primarily be for rescue ops. This will be for supporting Marine standin operations on and within the first island chain. The marines have been trying to figure out how they can handle sustainment and logistics in that environment.You can read some wonkish article about this (back in 2022) https://warontherocks.com/2022/09/sustainment-of-the-stand-i... . You'll note that the article does suggest revisiting seaplanes as a distribution option.With a few hundred miles range, these craft would be suitable as one way island to island hoppers, or 2 way over the horizon ship to shore transports. For a sense of scale, its ~140 miles from Luzon to Scarborough Shoal (one of the contested islands in the South China Sea).The "Viceroy" craft that Regent has mocked up on their website claims 180 mile range, 3500lb of cargo / 2 crew + 12 passengers.EDIT: And to be clear, the article title says "to get", but the article makes clear, this is basically a testing and development contract. There's no certainty that the Marines will get this capability in any meaningful way. Probably better to replace with "to test". This is particularly important because the commercial version of this craft is also still in development and testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is like the old Soviet Ekranoplans [1].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lun-class_ekranoplan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why the title clarifies "for rescue ops".Is there anything inherent to this technology that prevents it from being used for anything else? The article body insists on "demonstrations relevant to specific defense operations" which sounds quite broad and not limited to rescue ops in any way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510238</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository showcases a lightweight, easy-to-use publish-subscribe messaging system called Pico PubSub, designed for use in JavaScript applications. It facilitates asynchronous communication between components by allowing them to subscribe to and publish messages, enhancing modularity and separation of concerns. The repository includes installation instructions, usage examples, and API documentation, making it accessible for developers looking to implement a simple pub-sub pattern in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The API feels wrong. The object that was passed to pub() is the object that should be received by the callback passed to sub().The use of EventTarget/CustomEvent is an implementation detail; it should not be part of the API.As a result, every callback implementation is larger because it must explicitly unwrap the CustomEvent object.Essentially, the author made the library smaller by pushing necessary code to unwrap the CustomEvent object to the callsites. That's the opposite of what good libraries do!The mentioned nano-pubsub gets this right, and it even gets the types correct (which the posted code doesn't even try).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In similar spirit, a minimal implemention of KV store, in 22 bytes:  export default new Map&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not a huge fan of using CustomEvent for this.. esp. in terms of interoperability (which for these &lt;kb challenges probably doesnt matter)personally, i'll just roll with something like this which also is typed etc:    export function createPubSub&lt;T extends readonly any[]&gt;() {
      const l = new Set&lt;(...args: T) =&gt; void&gt;()

      return {
        pub: (...args: T) =&gt; l.forEach((f) =&gt; f(...args)),
        sub: (f: (...args: T) =&gt; void) =&gt; l.add(f) &amp;&amp; (() =&gt; l.delete(f)),
      }
    }

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What this mostly seems to demonstrate is that hip-pop is endlessly derivative. That might be a consequence of their data source:&gt; To build this project, we used the dataset of hundreds of thousands of songs on Genius.com accessible through their API, over 200,000 of which were “connected” in some way by sample, interpolation, cover, or remix.Genres where sampling is openly and explicitly acknowledged are going to be massively over-represented. It would be cool build a relationship network using feature extraction on the actual audio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once had the realization that a riff from Metallica's "The Four Horseman" was the same as that from Tom Petty's "Last Dance With Mary Jane" except, as I learned several years after the realization, it is actually the riff from "Sweet Home Alabama" which was introduced in a session as a joke by the guitarist to make fun of the drummer for having narrow musical knowledge. He was correct in his assumption that the drummer wouldn't recognize it, and it was included in the final version of the song.The story: https://youtube.com/shorts/nY6CPOtN47w?si=K_9EKvKGbgnuGKSgThe riffs: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2V6HbSkAD5g&amp;pp=ygUgZm91ciBob3J...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a similar vein, I maintain a website[0] where users can submit songs that sound like other songs. Several times this has helped me figure out where I’ve heard a riff or melody before (when it’s not a direct sample, which I usually find on whosampled.com).0: https://memalign.github.io/m/similarsongs.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551352</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see why you’d need software to calculate comp, if your comp system is so complex!As a case study in simplicity: our sales people get 1xMRR for each deal closed, or 2xMRR if the deal signs an annual contract. SDRs get a flat amount for each demo sat (doesn’t have to close, but does have to be accepted by the AE). The amount is equivalent to 0.75xMRR for a typical customer.That’s really all you need in SaaS. This has scaled from less than 1M ARR through to… more than 100x bigger than when it started.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needs to also model when to increase targets when it looks like Sales are in danger of hitting them /sarcasm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small nitpick ...I see "Commission Rate (%)" as an input (when normally I see it as "Sales Target" as the input - which derives your commission rate)Typically I see, $X is your Target Commission and $Y is your Sales Target.(and when you divide those two figures, it equates to your % Commission Rate)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43516325</guid></item><item><title>30.

I'm sad knowing he's passed, and thankful to have seen his work. Rest in peace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2012, he travelled to France and bought me a beer to thank me for my work on Org-Mode, and it was great. He was enthusiastic about this worldwide half-random connections, and insisted on how great it was to be able to connect with everyone in this way... we certainly miss him and that spirit.He contributed to GNU Emacs Org-Mode with gnugol: https://list.orgmode.org/4D210A00.9070901@teklibre.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry to hear this.

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Javice has been convicted of fraud for falsely claiming to have millions of customer accounts when she sold her company, Frank, to JPMorgan Chase. The court found that she had significantly inflated the number of actual student users of her financial aid platform, leading to JPMorgan's decision to acquire the startup. The ruling highlights issues of deceptive business practices in the tech industry, with Javice facing possible prison time and further legal repercussions as the case unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Frank’s chief software engineer, Patrick Vovor, testified that Javice had asked him to generate synthetic data to support her claim that the company had more than 4 million users. When Vovor asked if that was legal, prosecutors said, Javice and Amar assured him that it was — and told him they didn’t want to end up in orange prison jumpsuits. Vovor testified that he refused to help. “I told them I would not do anything illegal,” Vovor told jurors.&gt; Seeking to dent Vovor’s credibility, defense lawyers suggested he was resentful that Javice didn’t want to date him.That is one hell of a defense&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fraud is fraud, but I'm happy JPMorgan got caught up in this mess. Buying a promising startup for its technology or product is one thing, but the bank literally only cared about the personal data of its supposed 4 million high school and college aged users. Good riddance the whole thing imploded and there weren't real teenagers being spammed credit card and car loan offers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand how one could sell a company with millions of fake users and not expect the purchaser of that company to realize those users are fake?I understand how one could think you'd get away with it if one were lying to investors who might lack the ability to verify the claimsBut actually selling the company? How would that possibly work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43509733</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  It can also be improved; I know BLE is not _that_ effective under rubble.It's a tough problem to solve because you're up against the laws of physics and the very boring (and often counterintuitive)  "Antenna Theory". Bluetooth is in the UHF band, and UHF isn't good for penetrating anything let a lone concrete rubble.To penetrate rubble effectively you really want to be in the ELF-VLF bands, (That's what submarines/mining bots/underground seismic sensors use to get signals out).Obviously that's ridiculous. Everything from ELF to even HF is impossible to use in a "under the rubble" situation because of physics[1]. Bluetooth (UHF) might be "better than nothing" but you're losing at least 25-30 dBs (which is like 99.99% signal) in 12 inches of concrete rubble. VHF (like a handheld radio) can buy you another 5 inches.Honestly I think sound waves travel further in such medium than RF waves.[1]: Your "standard reference dipole" antenna needs to be 1/2 or 1/4 your wave length to resonate. At ELF-VLF range you need an antenna that's 10k-1k feet long. You can play with inductors and loops to electrically lengthen your antenna without physically lengthening it, but you're not gonna get that below 500-200 feet. The length of a submarine is an important design consideration when deciding on what type of radio signal it needs to be able to receive/transmit vs how deep it needs to be for stealth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. That said, I think that unless Apple and Google install something like this  by default, it won’t get much traction, because you can’t download the app when you really need it, and most people won’t think to download it before then.I just went through Helene in Asheville last year and it was painfully obvious that our cloud overlords have overlooked the offline disaster use case. Basically, when you’re in a situation where you desperately need technology to help, you’re on your own. I was imagining that tools like this would be great, but without the cloud, I was helpless.Maybe instead of trying to get users to install this, it could be a proof of concept to show what’s possible, and to say to Apple and Google: install this basic lifesaving tool on every phone by default?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool! I have been really enjoying using Meshtastic and LoRa lately. It feels like a blessed relief from the toxic swamp of the regular internet. I love pinging stupid radio messages across the bay without depending on any third-party infrastructure. Maybe in addition to the literal rubble of a life threatening disaster we can use tools like this to dig ourselves out from the psychological rubble of the information superfund site we have built for ourselves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551767</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My personal addition to an otherwise great article.Remember that you make your contribution because you or your company get something out of it. Don't expect any enthusiasm or kudos from the project's side. If these come, consider them a bonus. The contribution process will be slow. If you need the changes you are proposing, you will have to live with a fork or workarounds in your code for a while.Explain all the above to your company. Expect them to be completely clueless on how open source works, even if they are developers themselves.Personal anecdote on this: I had a team lead who insisted we directly submit a patch because "people would be thankful that we fix their code". And actually expected that they would have merged our fix before the end of our sprint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great blog! Great points about just running your own fork if needed and testing your own patch in your own system for a while. I would be very happy as a maintainer if someone put in that much effort for a fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to increase the liklyhood of your contribution being merged, do:* Provide unit-tests* Good types* No breaking changesAnd if you want breaking changes or grand new features to be merged, you have to show activity in the issue tracker or fix open bugs first, to show the maintainer that you are willing to deal with the fallout or support requests that follow after a PR gets merged. This is not to be rude. This is seeing a PR through the eyes of a maintainer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43515877</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a time when everyone played this in Poland - because of Adam Małysz's hype. It felt like the golden age of ski jumping, at least here. The game ran very slowly on my first 100 MHz CPU, which kinda helped with timing the jump. I could get it to run a bit faster by pressing the magic "turbo" (boost to 120 MHz) button on the case for a while, until the system BSoD'd. Another popular thing alongside it was so-called "Małysz" malware, which would spread via infected version of this game. I remember getting the game on a diskette and finding out it just formatted my drive with Windows (95?) install upon reboot. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tbh in Poland this game was called privately by all my colleagues "Małysz" - because people were so into ski jumping and Małysz was our hero. So I guess the huge fan base was in Poland at that time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rare game where having worse PC actually made you perform better. It was easier to time the jump perfectly. I recall starting 5 instances of it to slow it down as a kid and beating records.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations and challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the need for critical assessment of their effectiveness and ethical implications. It highlights issues such as biases, inaccuracies, and the potential for misuse in various applications. The author advocates for a more cautious approach to deploying LLMs, calling for transparency and improved regulatory frameworks to mitigate risks while leveraging their capabilities in a responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's a more general bifurcation here, between logic that:1. Intrinsically needs to be precise, rigid, even fiddly, or2. Has only been that way so far because that's how computers are1 includes things like security, finance, anything involving contention between parties or that maps to already-precise domains like mathematics or a game with a precise ruleset2 will be increasingly replaced by AI, because approximations and "vibes-based reasoning" were actually always preferable for those casesDifferent parts of the same application will be best suited to 1 or 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good post. I recently built a choose-your-own-adventure style educational game at work for a hackathon.Prompting an LLM to generate and run a game like this gave immediate impressive results, 10 mins after starting we had something that looked great. The problem was that the game sucked. It always went 3-4 rounds of input regardless. It constantly gave the game away because it had all the knowledge in the context, and it just didn't have the right flow at all.What we ended up with at the end of the ~2 days was a whole bunch of Python orchestrating 11 different prompts, no cases where the user could directly interact with the LLM, only one case where we re-used context across multiple queries, and a bunch of (basic) RAG to hide game state from the LLM until the user caused it to be revealed through their actions.LLMs are best used as small cogs in a bigger machine. Very capable, nearly magic cogs, but orchestrated by a lot of regular engineering work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The LLM shouldn’t be implementing any logic.There's separate machine Intelligence technique for that namely logic, optimization and constraint programming [1],[2].Fun facts, the modern founder of logic, optimization, and constraint programming is George Boole, the grandfather of Geoffrey Everest Hinton, the "Godfather of AI".[1] Logic, Optimization, and Constraint Programming: A Fruitful Collaboration - John Hooker - CMU (2023) [video]:https://www.youtube.com/live/TknN8fCQvRk[2] "We Really Don't Know How to Compute!" - Gerald Sussman - MIT (2011) [video]:https://youtube.com/watch?v=HB5TrK7A4pI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43542259</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghibli art is famous because ghibli art means ghibli movies. It is more beautiful in motion than still, the beauty is in part due to the emotion evoked by the story.There were a million Doom clones, none of which were as good as Doom. The same will be true of AI art copycats.This, however, is not the first time ghibli has had competition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_the_Witch's_Flower in fact they have a whole studio dedicated to copying ghibli: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_PonocYes they used to work at ghibli, but so too did john romero work at id, and yet daikatana was not a quake-killer.This doesn't devalue ghibli at all, I think(In fact, I think AI will always have the fundamental problem that most people have no taste or sense or introspection, they don't know why good things are good, and can't see that crap things are crap, so they are predestined to only be able to produce garbage. Nod to Ted Sturgeon.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read on Reddit that people love AI because it's "democratizing creativity". Let that sink in. People want to be dropped on the top of the mountain and be called an alpinist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What if the transcendence of a unique style into a commodity is inevitable for all greatly influential styles, and a mark of greatness not of debasement or dilution. What if instead of the "impurity" of the commons polluting the "purity" of the pure form, the pure form has evolved into a memetic virus that has infected everything and reproduced itself in many forms, beyond even the power of its creator? The creator's grief at, in part, loss of control is understandable but perhaps is a tribute to how what they created transcended them into a thing with a life of its own, one of the truest tributes to creative genius, no?What if a distinct style is not owned by one artist, even if they are most associated with it, but in reality, in art historical reality, is most commonly explored by a group of more and less famous creators, all as part of a movement, at a time? What influences did Ghibli draw on?Buddhism says all things are essentially empty of their own existence but are merely conditions resulting from other causes, and so on, in a chain unending. Like this.The pointillism[0] of Impressionism that ended up spread to the masses by countless including Bob Ross is one example of the memetic evolution and transcendent influence of "high art". Greatness can filter down but it doesn't mean it's not great.An iPhone is still a masterpiece even if you hold it in the ghetto. Does the ghetto pollute it or does it lift the ghetto? Maybe there's cross pollination, but I think it's infected with its greatness.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43540326</guid></item><item><title>39.

It’s comically bad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just tried the demo on the homepage and I don’t know what kind of sorcery this is but it’s blowing my mind.I input a bunch of completely made up words (Quastral Syncing, Zarnix Meshing, HIBAX, Bilxer) and used them in a sentence and the model zero-shotted perfect speech recognition!It’s so counterintuitive for me that this would work. I would have bet that you have to provide at least one audio sample in order for the model to recognize a word it was never trained on.Providing it to the model in text modality and it being able to recognize it in the audio modality must be an emergent property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so if i understand this correctly — you want the speech recognition model to identify a vocabulary of specific terms that it wasn't trained on. instead of fine-tuning with training data that includes the new vocabulary, you input the full vocabulary at test time as a list of words and the model is able to generate transcripts that include words from the vocabulary.seems like it could be very useful but it really comes down to the specifics.you can prompt whisper with context — how does this compare?how large of a vocabulary can it work with? if it's a few dozen words it's only gonna help for niche use cases. if it can handle 100s-1000s with good performance that could completely replace fine-tuning for many uses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543891</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "debts," both financial and technological, highlighting how various forms of debt can impact individuals and organizations. It explores the responsibilities and potential consequences associated with these debts, including the implications of taking on technology-related obligations. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the trade-offs and long-term ramifications of both types of debt, suggesting that a careful and informed approach is necessary for successful management and future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like we're stretching the metaphor when we apply it to things that won't necessarily compound in complexity or time required to fix it. This is often the case with technical stuff because things can depend on one another, but if you drop a bad process step, the time saved is probably linear since rarely do other teams need to change their process because you changed yours.Debt is scary as a metaphor because the interest compounds and the bank can repo things, but if you just owe a guy $10, he's not gonna come after you years later with a $300,000 bill. Non-compounding bad decisions are "you owe a guy $X" while the compounding ones are "debt".Maybe we should use "fees" and "debts" to differentiate these.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In an attempt to get a more general version of a debt metaphor, let's look at ingredients:
- there is a time interval 
- we have a utility function, or at least desire one or want to pretend we have one
- there is a decision
- there is uncertaintyFrom here there are many paths..."Deliberate vs inadvertent" describes whether we know about the effect the decision has on the utility function."Reckless vs prudent" describes whether we are rational and realize that decisions have consequences.It is also possible that we don't actually have a utility function. Or different people involved in the decision have different utility functions or don't feel the same responsibility towards the outcome (not unheard of when it comes to maintenance/design/architecture vs feature).What makes the debt metaphor very attractive is that it evokes an image of being in control. We may not have spelled out the utility function but everyone agrees it is bad now so we can pretend it was a rational choice we had. The alternative that we did not take any decision when we could have or were too distracted to see the consequences is much harder to accept. So now that we have debt, let's talk about whether we choose to pay it back or now.Rather than working hard to create this faux image of control, I wonder how often teams may be better off having an honest discussion about what the utility function is or should be, which decisions will make the group move in the right direction and how the team can keep oneself accountable that the effects that one had in mind actually took place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The survivor bias section at the end is summed up by a favorite response to premature scaling work at a startup: “We would be very fortunate to have that problem.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532328</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Gores World Map, created by cartographer John Gores in the early 19th century, which aimed to provide a more accurate representation of the Earth's geography. It highlights Gores' unique approach to mapping, including his innovative use of multiple layers and detailed geographic information, and reflects on the map's historical significance in the evolution of cartography. The piece also emphasizes the impact of Gores' work on later mapping techniques and its relevance in today’s understanding of global geography.&lt;/p&gt;

The maps can be either terrestrial (showing the earth) or celestial (showing the heavens) and the gores are typically football shaped.  The gores can be thought of as pre-assembled building blocks for a globe of a particular size which a globe-maker can quickly utilize to construct a globe without having to spend the time constructing the maps.  ”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43546607</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive overview of silica gel, including its properties, applications, and benefits. Silica gel is a porous and granular form of silicon dioxide, used primarily as a desiccant to control humidity and moisture in various environments. The article discusses its uses in packaging, preserving products, and maintaining the quality of goods during shipping. Additionally, it highlights the safety aspects of silica gel, dispelling common myths about its toxicity and providing guidance on proper handling and disposal. Overall, the site aims to inform readers about the versatile functionality and importance of silica gel in different industries.&lt;/p&gt;

It would be so insightful to understand to which degree the technology is subsidized and what the actual value/cost ratio is.I've read somewhere that generating a single AI image draws as much power as a full smartphone charge.In case the suspicion is true that costs are too high to be monetized, then the current scale-up phase is going to be interesting. Right now people infrequently have a chat with AI. That's quite a different scenario from having it integrated across every stack and it constantly being used in the background, by billions of people.Late as they may be, for the consumer space I think Apple is clever to push as much as possible to the local device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortly after ChatGPT hit the scene, everyone said "Google invented this technology, how could they fall so far behind in commercializing it, haha they're IBM now".Maybe they didn't fall behind in anything, maybe they just did an analysis of what it would cost to train transformer models with hundreds of billions of parameters, to run inferencing on them, and then decided that there was no way to actually be profitable doing this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As the global tech research company forecasts worldwide generative AI (GenAI) spending will reach $644 billion in 2025, up around 76 percent from 2024I’m having a hard time squaring the number $644 billion and the phrase “extinction phase.”I don’t believe their actual estimate of GenAI spending but if it’s even in the same ballpark as the real value, that’s not an extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543429</guid></item><item><title>46.

It emphasizes the advancements in computational neuroscience and the potential insights that such simulations could provide into brain function, behavior, and consciousness. The research reflects a broader aim to bridge the gap between biological understanding and artificial intelligence, highlighting the challenges and ethical considerations involved in these simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

So that level of "good" seems enormously far off.On the other hand, there are lots of useful approximations to be made.If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, is it a duck?If it squidges like a nematode and squirms like a nematode, is it a [simulation of a] nematode?(if it talks like a human and makes up answers like a human, is it a human? ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cf. the philosophical zombie:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombieWe really have no idea whether consciousness is something that can arise from computation, or whether it is somehow dependent on the physical substrate of the universe. Maybe we can create a virtual brain that, from the outside, is indistinguishable from a physical brain, and which will argue vociferously that it is a real person, and yet experiences no more conscious qualia than an equation written on a piece of paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43547813</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the idea of self-hosting, especially since I keep a number of very tiny websites/projects going at any given time, so resources would not really be too much of an issue for me.What stops me is security. I simply do not know enough about securing a self-hosted site on real hardware in my home and despite actively continuing to learn, it seems like the more I learn about it, the more questions I have. My identity is fairly public at this point, so if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person on HN or whatever, do I need to worry about someone much smarter than me setting up camp on my home network and ruining my life? That may sound really stupid to many of you, but this is the type of anxiety that stops the under-informed from trying stuff like this and turning to services like Akamai/Linode or DO that make things fairly painless in terms of setup, monitoring and protection.That said, I'm 110% open to reading/watching any resources people have that help teach newbies how to protect their assets when self-hosting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm slowly configuring my new VPS. Here's approach I'm taking:1. RHEL 9 with Developer Subscription. Installed dnf-automatic, set `reboot = when-changed`, so it's zero effort to reliably apply all updates with daily reboots. One or two minutes of downtime, not a big deal.2. For services: podman with quadlets. It's RH-flavoured replacement for docker-compose. Not sure, if I like it, but I guess that's the "future", so I'm embracing it. Every service is a custom-built image with common parent to reduce space waste (by reusing base OS layer).So far I want to run static http (nginx), vaultwarden, postfix and some webmail. May be more in the future.This setup wastes a lot of disk space for image data, so expect to order few more gigabytes of disk to pay for modern tech.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last thing I need is Kubernetes at home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43544979</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chess and Go are very different in that one is for points and the other is for annihilation. However, Go solved the draw (and first player advantage) with 'komi'. Giving white (the second player) some extra points, I think it's usually around 6.5 points right now. The amount that komi should be is still up for debate and changing, though I think everyone agrees the half portion is good.Though stronger players can no longer give 'presents', where you force a draw on a weaker opponent by ensuring both players end up with the same amount of points.Is there amendment to chess that could work similarly? Nothing is coming to mind, but Chess is not my domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of an asymmetric Chess starting position is very interesting, although it does introduce more risk of one side starting with a big advantage (perhaps this has been analyzed).I also like that in this variant, castling works like normal -- that is one of the most unintuitive aspects of Chess960.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t personally think reducing draws would improve the game at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520005</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many thanks for the warm welcome, everyone.It’s been a privilege to help support this community and to work alongside dang, who has been a great friend and mentor for many years. It’s a great responsibility, to keep HN a healthy and thriving community, and I’m continually amazed to see all the ways dang puts thought and energy into it.One final note is that it was never part of the negotiations that I was expected to know or learn Arc, yet somehow in the onboarding process the HN Arc repo has found its way onto my machine, so it feels like the bait and switch is on…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Welcome Tom! I want to add to the chorus saying how excellent HN has been for so many years, in large part thanks to the excellent moderation. I dove into forums early on and they have always been one of the favorite and most treasured parts of the internet. It's not an exaggeration to say that HN is one of the best ever. The longevity is commendable, especially in an industry full of fads and flameouts.Dang and Tom, please keep doing what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the classic tradition of thinking that “dang” is pronounced “dang” and not “Dan G.” I propose that we read “tomhow” as “Tomh Ow”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43558671</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the inefficiencies of synchronizing all data between applications and proposes a more selective approach. It emphasizes the importance of identifying critical data that truly requires synchronization rather than indiscriminately syncing everything. The author advocates for better strategies to improve performance, reduce costs, and simplify data management by focusing on essential data needs and optimizing the synchronization process accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The consistency model doesn't seem to make sense.https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft/blob/main/docs/design....&gt; Graft clients commit locally and then asynchronously attempt to commit remotely. Because Graft enforces Strict Serializability globally, when two clients concurrently commit based on the same snapshot, one commit will succeed and the other will fail.OK, but, the API provides only a single commit operation:&gt; commit(VolumeId, ClientId, Snapshot LSN, page_count, segments) Commit changes to a Volume if it is safe to do so. The provided Snapshot LSN is the snapshot the commit was based on. Returns the newly committed Snapshot on success.So if a client commits something, and it succeeds, presumably locally, then how should that client discover that the "async" propagation of that commit has failed, and therefore everything it's done on top of that successful local commit needs to be rolled-back?This model is kind of conflating multiple, very different, notions of "commit" with each other. Usually "commit" means the committed transaction/state/whatever is guaranteed to be valid. But here it seems like a "local commit" can be invalidated at some arbitrary point in the future, and is something totally different than an "async-validated commit"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey friends!
Author of Graft here. Just want to say, huge thanks for all the great comments, stars, and support. Feels really nice to finally be building in public again.I'm going to force myself to sign off for the evening. Will be around first thing to answer any other questions that come up! I just arrived to Washington, DC to attend Antithesis BugBash[1] and if I don't get ahead of the jet lag I'm going to regret it.If anyone happens to be around Washington this week (perhaps at the conference) and wants to meet up, please let me know! You can email me at hello 
 [at] orbitinghail [dotdev].[1]: https://bugbash.antithesis.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, if I understand correctly, the consistency model is essentially git. I.e. you have a local copy, makes changes to it, and then when its time to "push" you can get a conflict where you can "rebase" or "merge".The problem here is that there is no way to cleanly detect a conflict. The documentation talks about pages which have changed, but a page changing isnt a good indicator of conflict. A conflict can happen due to a read conflict. E.g.Update Customer Id: "UPDATE Customers SET id='bar' WHERE id='foo'; UPDATE Orders SET customerId='bar' WHERE customerId='foo'"Add Customer Purchase: "SELECT id FROM Customers WHERE email="blah"; INSERT INTO Orders(customerId, ...) VALUES("foo", ...);"If the update task gets committed first and the pages for the Orders table are full (i.e. inserting causes a new page to allocated) these two operations dont have any page conflicts, but the result is incorrect.\In order to fix this, you would need to track the pages read during the transaction in which the write occurred, but that could easily end up being the whole table if the update column isnt part of an index (and thus requiring a table scan).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43537272</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a creative illustration series featuring 13 different animals, each uniquely designed using only 13 circles. It showcases the simplicity and artistic potential of minimalism in design, inviting readers to appreciate how basic shapes can be transformed into recognizable animal forms. The playful concept highlights the versatility of circles and encourages creativity in both art and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods for constructing attribution graphs, which are tools used to analyze the impact and contribution of various elements in complex systems like machine learning models. It emphasizes the importance of clear methodologies for effectively attributing outcomes to their sources within these graphs. The article outlines several techniques, including statistical approaches and computational methods, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of attribution processes. Ultimately, the piece serves as a resource for understanding how to systematically assess the contribution of individual components in various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Deep learning models produce their outputs using a series of transformations distributed across many computational units (artificial “neurons”). The field of mechanistic interpretability seeks to describe these transformations in human-understandable language.This is the central theme behind why I find techniques like genetic programming to be so compelling. You get interpretability by default. The second order effect of this seems to be that you can generalize using substantially less training data. The humans developing the model can look inside the box and set breakpoints, inspect memory, snapshot/restore state, follow the rabbit, etc.The biggest tradeoff here being that the search space over computer programs tends to be substantially more rugged. You can't use math tricks to cheat the computation. You have to run every damn program end-to-end and measure the performance of each directly. However, you can execute linear program tapes very, very quickly on modern x86 CPUs. You can search through a billion programs with a high degree of statistical certainty in a few minutes. I believe we are at a point where some of the ideas from the 20th century are viable again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For people new to this maybe check out this video, it explains how the internals run pretty quickly https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UKcWu1l_UNwIn theory if Anthropic puts research into the mechanics of the models internals, we can get better returns in training and alignment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the pdf available somewhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532253</guid></item><item><title>5.

When archived, expunged or dismissed infractions never truly become that.

So, there is a flip side to this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of panic and overlap in the space; a way to coordinate these efforts would be helpful.Internet Archive et al. made noise and promises but told volunteers to stop because they couldn't actually handle the ingest.https://www.reddit.com/r/Archiveteam/comments/1jbgycm/us_gov...These folks made a notable effort.https://webrecorder.net/blog/2025-03-25-govarchive-us-and-mi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best thing I ever heard from the head of archives at the BBC:Once you format shift, you will always be format shifting.Keep your originals whenever you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43558182</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the launch of the Matrix Auth Service, which aims to enhance user authentication within the Matrix ecosystem. It introduces features such as single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and improved user management, making it easier for individuals and organizations to adopt Matrix for communication. The service is designed to provide a more secure and user-friendly experience while promoting widespread access to decentralized communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! I’ve recently consolidated all of my Google Chat and WhatsApp friends onto Matrix (via Element) because it’s E2EE. Gchat isn’t and I assume that Meta has a backdoor into WhatsApp conversations. So, those platforms can’t be trusted. Signal doesn’t have a web interface, so that’s a no-go for me. lol Telegram.Matrix has been great for me and I recommend that everyone else use it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I set firefox to clear cookies, also using cookies to "strict"This somehow causes a huge pain to connect to mozilla's matrix instance, and I never understood why. This is a bit ironic since firefox has that feature to clear cookies.I had to reset password, and do other weird things, I can't remember what exactly.I hope this MAS thing fixes it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I vaguely remember an old MSC or TWIM or something that described (the possibility of) a new authentication mechanism whereby I could set up either a dummy homeserver or something in .well_known that would allow me to use my own domain but without needing to use my own homeserver for the actual traffic. Sort of like an auth-only homeserver, if you will.Is that part of MAS? Was that initiative ever fully-baked? Or am I just misremembering?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43558464</guid></item><item><title>8.

The music was not only an afterthought but also insulting to the idea that you would soon climb into a sleek metal tube and be propelled by engines through the sky at 40,000 feet. “I started thinking, ‘What should we be hearing here?’ I thought most of all you wanted music that didn’t try to pretend you weren’t going to die on the plane, ” Eno, laughing but serious."https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brian-eno-ambient-1-mus...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great song.For anyone curious how to produce something that sounds like this, paulstretch is the way to do it.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alright, i had plans to use Github (or maybe something Cloudflare ish) but your $2/m has me seriously interested. I'm reviewing now.I hate when i see fun side projects that cost the same as full subscriptions to other products. There's only a handful of $15/m services i "want" in my life.. it really raises the barrier to entry when i'm so aware and averse to subscription costs.Yet $2/m? Instantly sold on that price. It's a fun price, it looks like a fun product, it lines up perfectly for me. It's silly that the price has me almost more interested than the product. Love itThanks for this, i plan to try it out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I stumbled across this clever service when looking for a “pastebin” that handled rendering terminal output with ANSI codes. The irony is that they don’t actually allow that (just plain text can be piped to their pastes service), but I found their whole site and vibe delightful!And the two authors, qudat, and antoniomima  are active on HN, as their responsive comments here demonstrate. Just good work all around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love the idea, but I couldn't find a "pricing" page and wanted to abandon reading immediately (I have no time for unsustainable services). Then I learned from the discussion that the pricing is $2/m, which, two things: 1) I still can't find that price on the web site, and 2) it seems unsustainable to me, so I'm still worried.I run a B2B SaaS. Support costs is what eats you alive: in case of a complex B2B app anything below $40/month is unsustainable. This is of course better for simpler apps/services, but even there you have to be super careful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560899</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that really stuck out to me in the write speed graphs is the dropouts in the speed.  The Maxell seemed to be the only one that didn't have them.Back in the day my company had a regionally-slightly-popular Linux distro.  Every couple months we'd burn 500-700 discs.  We were small enough that it didn't make sense to mass produce, so we burned them ourselves.We would occasionally get reports from people of being unable to read the discs, and so we went through ~6 months of investigation, test shipping to relatives, paying our customers to ship the discs back so we could check them.Eventually I found that while every disc would validate by checksum of the entire disc (part of our burn process), if I tracked the time required to read every block, the discs that people had problems with would tend to have some spikes in the time it took to read some blocks.  The drives we were using would read them, sometimes taking an amazingly long time to do so (like 30 minutes instead of 2), but users drives would just fail them.Eventually I wrote a new validation process that in addition to the checksum used the timing information as well to determin if the disc failed, and at that point our failures in the field basically went to 0.But, we got really sensitive to vendors of discs.  Basically it was Taiyo Yuden or nothing.  Some big brands would give us 20% failures to burn, where Taiyo Yuden was &lt;1%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also thought this was a longevity test.I do love optical media and have a considerable CD, DVD, minidisc, and blu-ray collection. Like a Luddite, I still enjoy burning my own.I especially like my Superscope disc copier. It completely disregards copy protection and I frequently make a backup of my favorite CDs which I store. Although much of my stock are older blanks (like those listed in this article)I’ll be sad if CD-R disappears from the market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great choice with the Pioneer DVR-111. They're my favorite series of drives ever. NEC ND-3500 chipset; Pioneer mechanism.Pioneer publish the approved media list for their drives but it's not really detailed enough since it only lists by manufacturer while the firmware is operating on manufacturer plus media code: https://www.mfdigital.com/downloads/Pioneer%20111%20approved...You can potentially get better results by patching your discs into your drive's firmware using MediaCodeSpeedEdit: https://ala42.cdfreaks.com/MCSE/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551663</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They can do that, yet somehow, Gemini Assistant on Pixel phones still fails to reliably set timers or add shopping list items :-)(which worked fine with Google Assistant)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "how" is completely missing, but if they can get this to work semi reliably it will be ChatGPT x100 in terms of impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if Google's robotics technology (software and hardware) is leading edge does anyone think they'll actually be able to productize it? Seems similar to how they were the pre-product leaders in transformers and then fumbled any advantage they had to ChatGPT. It seems like something's missing from Google where they can't get from research to product effectively. Waymo perhaps a good counterexample if you think where they are today is product/market fit, but I can't shake the feeling that Google more often than not can't seem to get things to market or even if they do they give up on them before they take hold.Just wondering if anyone has a strong feeling or, better yet, insight on this regarding their robotics efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43557310</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is set to launch Thundermail, a new email service aimed at competing with established platforms like Gmail and Microsoft 365. This service is part of Mozilla's broader strategy to enhance user privacy and security, offering features that prioritize data protection. Thundermail is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Mozilla products and aims to provide users with a customizable and user-friendly email experience. The initiative reflects Mozilla's commitment to providing alternatives to mainstream services while addressing growing concerns over user data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope for the best but plan for the worst:I don't think people want to change email addresses very often. How do I know Mozilla will still be doing this in 5-10 years? (Edit: Others have pointed out that, if we can bring our own domains, technical users can retain their address. However, for non-technical users that's not an option.)Also, I'm not sure about charging a fee at the start (except for TB contributors) and providing a free tier later - reverse of the usual way of launching a product. Maybe this is a soft launch to shake out the bugs and build a little momentum, and you can pay if you want to take part?Mozilla could do something awesome here. I hate to say it, but here is a chance to start fresh and make big, legacy-breaking changes to Thunderbird. The new audience - which should become the vast majority if they are successful - won't care if it's not like the old Thunderbird (possibly unlike many on HN). Here is a chance to do something special and the mail client is all most users see or understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make thunderbird supports a local database with 100k emails with proper search ! Make us pay for that optimization if needed. Email is a big tool of communication for all businesses, Pros who make money daily through emails need to handle tons of emails, we’re ready to pay for that&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://thundermail.comSite is here with waitlist signup. It's also titled "For Those Who Know" and says: &gt;&gt; status beta_signup.is_open=true so perhaps theres a CLI or hidden way to signup immediately?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560885</guid></item><item><title>14.

I know you can jailbreak them and achieve something similar to OP, but it'd be neat if you could just drop the vendor's e-reader firmware entirely and run your own software.[0] https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/9.7inch-e...[1] https://soldered.com/product/inkplate-10-9-7-e-paper-board-c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun. I used an e-ink display for something similar (just the weather forecast) and opted to use the onboard ESP-32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Linux binary compatibility, focusing on the challenges and solutions for running binaries compiled for one Linux distribution on another. It highlights the importance of understanding how libraries, dependencies, and system calls affect compatibility across different versions and flavors of Linux. The piece emphasizes methods such as using containerization, compatibility layers, and application packaging techniques to facilitate smoother execution of binaries across diverse environments, ultimately aiming to enhance software portability and user experience in the Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So of the 3 glibc issues they link- one is about the format of symbol information in the actual ELF binaries which is only an issue if you are not using the standard libc functions for looking up symbols for some strange reason- one is an issue that impacts targeting a lower version of glibc from a higher one which is a configuration that was never supported (though usually fails more loudly)- the last one is a security policy change which is legitimately an ABI break, but mostly impacts programs that have their execstack flags set incorrectlyglibc actually goes to a fair bit of effort to be compatible with old binaries unlike most of the  rest of the Linux userspace. The binaries I built for my side project back in 2015 (BlastEm 0.3.0) still work fine on modern Linux and they dynamically link against glibc. This is just a hobby project, not a piece of professional software, and a build from before this JangaFX company even existed works fine.I find it really bizarre when people talk about Linux binary compat and then complain entirely about glibc rather than the sort of problems that the manylinux project has had to deal with. glibc is one of the few parts of userspace you can depend on. Yes, setting up your toolchain to build against an old glibc on a modern distro is a bit annoying. Sure, if you do something sufficiently weird you might find yourself outside what glibc considers part of their stable ABI. But from where I sit, it works pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no distinction between system and program libraries in Linux. We used to pretend there was one before usrmigration, but that was never good to take seriously.The distro as packager model ensures that everything is mixed together in the filesystem and is actively hostile to external packaging. Vendoring dependencies or static linking improves compatibility by choosing known working versions, but decreases incentive and ability for downstream (or users) to upgrade those dependencies.The libc stuff in this article is mostly glibc-specific, and you'd have fewer issues targeting musl. Mixing static linking and dlopen doesn't make much sense, as said here[1] which is an interesting thread. Even dns resolution on glibc implies dynamic linking due to nsswitch.Solutions like Snap, Flatpak, and AppImage work to contain the problem by reusing the same abstractions internally rather than introducing anything that directly addresses the issue. We won't have a clean solution until we collectively abandon the FHS for a decentralized filesystem layout where adding an application (not just a program binary) is as easy as extracting a package into a folder and integrates with the rest of the system. I've worked on this off and on for a while, but being so opinionated makes everything an uphill battle while accepting the current reality is easy.[1] https://musl.openwall.narkive.com/lW4KCyXd/static-linking-an...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why they don't just statically link their binaries. First, they said this:&gt; Even if you managed to statically link GLIBC—or used an alternative like musl—your application would be unable to load any dynamic libraries at runtime.But then they immediately said they actually statically link all of their deps aside from libc.&gt; Instead, we take a different approach: statically linking everything we can.If they're statically linking everything other than libc, then using musl or statically linking glibc will finish the job. Unless they have some need for loading share libs at runtime which they didn't already have linked into their binary (i.e. manual dlopen), this solves the portability problem on Linux.What am I missing (assuming I know of the security implications of statically linked binaries -- which they didn't mention as a concern)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551934</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the encounter between the renowned Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and a lesser-known figure, illuminating Borges's views on identity, literature, and the nature of existence. It highlights how this meeting challenged Borges's understanding of reality and the complexities of human connections, showcasing his philosophical musings and the influence of his literary style. The piece also reflects on the broader implications of this encounter for readers and writers, underscoring Borges's impact on contemporary literature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone here hasn't read Borges, I'd strongly recommend him. Pretty much everything he wrote was short, &lt;20 pages, and so it's really easy to sit down and read one of his stories over a lunch break. The common recommendation would be to try out Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius and see if you like it. If so, it's part of Labyrinths, which is (in my opinion) his best collection of short stories. The best edition in English is probably Penguin's Collected Fictions.Regarding the content of this interview:&gt;If you compiled an enormous dataset of everything Borges read, and combined it with an exquisitely sensitive record of every sensory experience he ever had, could you create a Borges LLM?This is my Kantian way of thinking about epistemology, but I don't think that LLMs can create synthetic a priori knowledge. Such knowledge would be necessary to create Borges out of a world without Borges.In this interview, Simon's view feels much more like the way Hume viewed people as mechanical "bundles of sensations" rather than possessing a transcendent "self". This led to his philosophical skepticism, which was (and still is I guess) a philosophical dead end for a lot of people. I think such epistemological skepticism is accurate when applied to machines, at least until some way of creating synthetic a priori knowledge is established (Kant did so with categories for humans, what would the LLM version of this be?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you compiled an enormous dataset of everything Borges read, and combined it with an exquisitely sensitive record of every sensory experience he ever had, could you create a Borges LLM?Hmm, what if you could recreate, word-for-word, the great works of an author like Borges (or, say, Cervantes) by so thoroughly understanding their life that the words themselves came out of you, not memorized and recapitulated, but naturally and unbidden? What an interesting idea for a story, maybe an LLM will be able to write that one day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Borges is totally recommended, of course, but after reading him in the original language I think his English translations lack the poetry and music of his writings. For once I am happy Spanish is my first language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43559122</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the metaphorical and literal loss of color in the world, discussing how vibrant colors are seen to diminish in various aspects of life, such as art, nature, and human emotions. It examines societal trends, environmental changes, and the impact of technology on our perception of color. The piece argues that this loss reflects deeper issues, including disconnection from nature and a lack of emotional expression, ultimately urging a reconnection with vibrant experiences and the natural world to restore richness in life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not "losing" color.At periods when technology resulted in new color possibilities, people went overboard with color. Make all the things colorful!! Think of the technicolor sixties. And we can go back in history and see the same thing with new clothing pigments, new paint pigments.But when everything is colorful, nothing stands out. Everything being colorful is as monotonous as everything being, well, monotone.Modern taste is more about more neutral-colored foundations with color accents. Don't paint a whole room green -- have a gorgeous green plant that stands out all the more against its neutral background. Don't paint a whole wall orange -- have a beautiful orange-hued piece of art on the wall. It's just more tasteful to use color as one element, along with size, shape, texture, and so forth. Making it the main element in everything is just overdoing it. It's bad design.I don't want constant "riotous color", as the article puts it, in my home, or my workplace, or while I'm driving. It's visually exhausting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, so much to rage about from the article.I am a huge fan of color and go out of my way to buy bright colored cars, phones, etc. (Not like I had any viable options for my MacBook Pro though).Resale value, it hides dirt well are some of the sadder excuses I hear for buying gray and "silver" cars (wouldn't be cool if they really were silver, not "metallic gray"). Meanwhile you spend your entire time owning the car and driving around like a brooding storm cloud.Color grading might be the most evil thing to descend on film making. It's to the point of distraction now. Like it draws attention to itself. (Watching "Mickey 17" in a theater and a scene comes on that screams "color graded!" and then it's become all I can see. Kind of like the nausea-inducing, shaky "hand held camera" thing that was so predominate some decades ago. Good riddance to that.Oh well, I guess all I can do is to keep voting with my shopping preferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would argue that the main reason is because everything is about money, and the shorter marketability of everything. Colors are polarising, and affect the unsold inventory and perceived resale value.Why manufacture objects in 10 different colours if you know the green one is going to be a tough sell? Why buy a blue car if you think you’re going to sell it back after 2 years and struggle to do so?You don’t want things you don’t intend to keep to have personally, period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43557471</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of Mermaid charts with Visual Studio Code through a dedicated plugin, which facilitates the creation and editing of Mermaid.js diagrams directly within the IDE. It highlights the benefits of using this plugin, such as enhanced productivity, seamless diagram management, and the ease of incorporating visual elements into code documentation. The piece also compares traditional methods of creating diagrams with the efficiency offered by the plugin, encouraging developers to leverage this tool for better visualization of ideas and processes in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like Mermaid, but I'm not seeing the value in this as is.- Mermaid within .md is widely supported. The file format of .mmd, while supported in most integrations, is a standalone file rather than living within my documentation/markdown. I use Mermaid charts and graphs as visual aids to add to the documentation or notes rather than having them stand alone. If I wanted a standalone file, I'd use any other diagram tool with its proprietary file format. I like Meriamid because of how easy it is to integrate into markdown. The value isn't in having a Mermaid file; the value is in adding diagrams and charts to markdown.- Within .md files there's a Mermaid logo added beside the Mermaid, but it doesn't seem to be clickable or have a context menu. Maybe this is a bug. It also weirdly highlights all of the Mermaid code. Why doesn't it syntax highlight within markdown? This extension works great for highlighting: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=bpruitt...- It doesn't add support for viewing mermaid within markdown preview. I currently use this extension for it. This is a key feature that is missing. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=bierner...Overall, excited to see what this becomes. Hope this is useful feedback! It can only get better from here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps PlantUML isn't as new and interesting as Mermaid, but each time I try a side-by-side comparison, the results are always better in PlantUML than Mermaid. I'll admit that the Mermaid syntax is a lot easier to understand, but the PlantUML syntax is a lot more powerful. I especially like the new Activity diagrams in PlantUML with the conditionals and looping syntax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mermaid is fantastic as a portable I/O format for LLM context. I spent some time discussing entity relationships with an LLM recently, and had it produce a Mermaid diagram to wrap up the conversation.Once you have the diagram code, you can use that as an artifact for new LLM chats related to databases, APIs, etc.I'm not sure what the history of mermaidchart.com specifically is, but I'm guessing it's new since the ER diagram docs are marked as "coming soon":https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid/er/syntaxI'm curious how this plugin compares to Markdown Preview Mermaid Support:

You may have some in your own yard used as a hedge plant. I have several large trees on my place. It spreads underground by suckers and will take over an area if you do nothing to contain it. It is very strong once it forms a thicket. I have driven across a yaupon thicket in a seismic buggy and been in a situation where none of the tires were touching the ground as I drove because I was crossing a thick tangle of yaupon that supported the vehicle.Caffeine levels are lower than coffee beans (40-60 mg versus &gt;150 mg I think). Yaupon does also have theobromines, vasodilators, that are supposed to help it prevent the caffeine crash.I have some leaves dried and drink it make a tea occasionally when I want a boost but not a cup of coffee level boost. It tastes great and is easy to prepare at home.[0]https://yauponbrothers.com/blogs/news/is-yaupon-better-than-...There are other sources of information about yaupon holly. It is proposed that the British naturalist who discovered Native Americans using it in their own ceremonies and drinking it casually decided to name it ilex vomitoria not because it was dangerous or poisonous to consume but because since it grew wild in the colonies, it could be a serious competitor to English tea so he used the name to make it less attractive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine production is likely difficult in the face of a drier climate. Caffeine is present in the plant as a pesticide. Insects are a much bigger problem in wet climates over dry.Having grown up in a wet climate (Chicago) but now living in a dry one (Utah) I can say that finding a droubt tolerant species which concerns itself with pesticide production may be difficult. The same water which coffee relies on is the same stuff pests rely on to reproduce. My mother was from Utah, and she always lamented at the small size of her flowers growing up in Chicago. They are much larger in Utah because they can get big without insects eating them.(I say all this as a point of interest, but I don't drink coffee myself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://youtu.be/iGL7LtgC_0I?si=V8vXK4QzF_lAfRjBJames Hoffman did an interesting episode on this bean a few years ago, very cool the work being done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555286</guid></item><item><title>22.

Well…no. It was possible to modify the phone number being sent, and then receive data back for Verizon numbers not associated with the signed in user.Yikes. Seems like a pretty massive oversight by Verizon. I wish in situations like this there was some responsibility of the company at fault to provide information about if anyone else had used and abused this vector before it was responsibly disclosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The Verizon Call Filter app uses the endpoint hxxps://clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval to lookup call history for the authenticated user and display it in the app.Have you ever seen a more internal-looking domain name?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy that this is possible at such a giant like Verizon.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This, to paraphrase Portlandia, is one of the dreams of the ’90s — that our work selves and our true natures could be one and the same.I have always wanted to achieve this (to no avail so far). To live for something bigger. To be pushed to use my talents in full. To evolve without stop and throw away the old self without hesitance. These three to me are arguably the important characteristics of a true human-being. They (and some other characteristics) tell humans from animals.It may sound like, but is not, workaholism. Workaholism is escapism. Workaholism, like alcoholism, roots from a certain sad history one wants to avoid. This is not workaholism, but a conscious pursuit of perfection, of "Godhood", as one may say as an atheist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computing was less annoying before it became a branch of the advertising industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microserfs has a permanent spot on my bookshelf, and really did a great job capturing the zeitgeist of working in tech in the 90s. It was more about the early 90s than the late 90s when I started in tech, but not much really changed until the dotCom bubble burst in 2000. A lot of us who didn't happen to work for GiantTech in the 90s shared the existential anxieties described in earlier chapters of the book, but without the upside of lucrative stock options. It's worth a read if you haven't. A lot of it is still relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551338</guid></item><item><title>25.

More info on an equally charming old website here, including a remarkable letter from his wife:http://josephoster.com/billsvoyage/index.htmlI suppose every wife in any generation wants their husbands to be safe, but each generation has a different approach to risk and adventure. I know my wife would be resolutely opposed to any voyage like this (says the man with a dream of sailing a Hobie Cat across the Great Lakes...perhaps when my son is grown).This page also includes a 100x136 pixel high-resolution color digital photo of the boat, and the year: 2002.http://josephoster.com/billsvoyage/potter.htmlThere's also an update page with a GIF animation of the weather accompanied by the text "WARNING!!! file size: 1.5 MBytes"From the article:&gt; The batteries were charged for about 1 hour daily using a Honda EU 1000 gasoline generator coupled with a 3-stage battery charger. The generator burned 1-1/2 gallons of gas in 24 days. ... There was no backup power source for charging the batteries.24 hours of runtime and 1.5 gallons of gas equate to 0.625 gallon usage per hour. From the spec sheet, an EU1000 generator has a 0.55 gallon tank and can run for 6.8 hours at 225W output, that's 0.081 gallons per hour, so I estimate that the generator was operating at about 174 watts, given it ran for an hour that's 174 watthours per day.23 years later, anyone would assume that your default source of 174 watthours per day would be a solar panel. A single 2x3 foot rigid panel would do ~100W peak and see the equivalent of 4-6 peak hours per day, easily beating that requirement. Any serious sailboat (even a little trailerable 19' coastal boat like this one) would have a whole array powering lighting and sensors and radar/radios and telemetry and would budget much more than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait, is this exact boat for sale?

Looking forward to using this instead!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might be jaded, but I think having libraries for such simple use cases leads to the inevitable `left-pad` situation.When I say simple use cases I mean that since you probably don't need all of these functions at once that it would be easier to copy the code you need if you don't feel comfortable writing it instead of adding yetanotherlibrary to your dependency tree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A feature complete Python text case conversion libraryI suspect you mean "featureful", "full-featured" or similar[1]—"feature complete" means that you're not going to add any more features.[1] https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/393517/what-do-y...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551915</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article on air pollution sources provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of air pollutants, their origins, and their impacts on health and the environment. It categorizes pollution sources into natural and anthropogenic (human-made) activities, detailing contributions from sectors such as transportation, industry, agriculture, and residential heating. The article also discusses the global trends in air quality, the specific pollutants involved (like particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide), and the frameworks for measuring and addressing air pollution through policy interventions and technology. Furthermore, it emphasizes the significance of understanding these sources to effectively combat air pollution and enhance public health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the most striking aspects of air pollution is how invisible yet pervasive its effects are. Unlike more immediate environmental disasters, air pollution slowly chips away at public health, reducing life expectancy and quality of life, often without dramatic headlines. The comparison to starvation as a "frailty multiplier" is an interesting one; pollution doesn’t always kill directly but makes people more susceptible to fatal conditions.Regarding the reduction in SO₂ emissions from shipping fuel, I’d love to see more discussion on how international regulatory pressure (e.g., IMO 2020) managed to enforce compliance in an industry notorious for cost-cutting. Was it simply a case of the alternatives being feasible enough, or did global coordination and monitoring play a stronger role than usual?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought that this article will address an elephant in the room but either it missed it or I missed it.My problem with pollution is that… you need to measure it, and those who pollute don’t do it consciously. Anecdotally I often drive through a small town. You can smell pollution, a plastic smell. In winter you can see column of smoke coming out of chimney. Sometimes it’s milky white, sometimes it thick black. There are many like that. I asked shop keeper is it happening often, she confirmed and said that no one is interested in doing otherwise, installing sensors was directly opposed by town council.The town is not on a pollution map. Nearby cities are with medium-high pollution but that particular region is supposedly clean as reported by a single sensor positioned somewhere on a hill.It’s not like there is one town like that in the world. There are nations that pollute heavily and don’t care and don’t meter the impact. I would be curious if all the effort, regulations etc. are worth it when applied to average Joe versus huge polluters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting article. I always assumed that a large part of the "soot" air pollution in cities came from car tyres as well, since their compounds are one of the main sources for the dust that deposits in apartments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43553663</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on a novel deep learning method aimed at enhancing the performance of various machine learning models. It introduces a framework that combines different neural network architectures to optimize the predictive capabilities and robustness against overfitting. Through empirical evaluations, the method demonstrates improvements in accuracy on several benchmark datasets, showing its potential applications in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The findings suggest that integrating multiple models can lead to superior performance compared to using a single architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is another potential improvement to the transformer architecture from Facebook (the other one that comes to mind is this one from same authors: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18719), but note that it comes with a major problem that might not be obvious at first glance: it's just not usable in practice without a ton of work. It modifies the innards of the attention mechanism, so it is incompatible with Flash Attention (or any other optimized attention library), and you do not want to train anything beyond toy models without Flash Attention (the performance hit is just way too big).There's pytorch's FlexAttention which could maybe make this practical, but currently it's just way too buggy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. So they convolve the k,v, q vectors? I have been trying the opposite.I have been working on a classification problem on audio data (with context size somewhere between 1000 and 3000 with potential to expand later). I have been experimenting with adding attention onto a CNN for a classification task I have been working on.I tried training a vanilla transformer but in the sizes that I am aiming for (5-30M parameters), the training is incredibly unstable and doesn't achieve the performance of an LSTM.So I went back to CNNs which are fast to train but don't achieve the losses of LSTMs (which are much slower to train,and for higher context sizes you get into the vanishing gradient problem). The CNN-GRU hubrid a worked much better, giving me my best result.The GRU layer I used had a size of 512. For increasing context sizes, I'd have to make the convolutional layers deeper so as not to increase the GRU size too large. Instead, I decided to swap out the GRU with a MultiHeadAttention layer. The results are great - better than the CNN-GRU (my previous best). Plus, for equivalent sizes the model is faster to train though it hogs a lot of memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare with Byte Latent Transformer [1]? This happens with convolution post-embedding while BLT happens with attention at embedding time?1. https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transf...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562384</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities surrounding job performance and the perception that people may be inadequate in their roles. It highlights the influence of systemic factors, such as poor management, unrealistic expectations, and lack of resources, on employees' ability to succeed in their jobs. The author argues that while individual performance can vary, it is essential to consider the broader context in which employees operate, suggesting that many issues attributed to personal shortcomings may stem from larger organizational problems. By addressing these systemic issues, businesses can create a more supportive environment that fosters better performance and job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

The expectation is to get it done as quickly as possible and not do more unless told so.In SW development in the 90s I had much more time for experimentation to figure things out. In the last years you often have some manager where you basically have to justify every thing you do and always a huge pile of work that never gets smaller. So you just hurry through your tasks.I think google had it right for a while with their 20% time where people could do wanted to do. As far as I know that’s over.People need some slack if you want to see good work. They aren’t machines that can run constantly on 100% utilization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gig economy is way worse than the author describes.Gig workers can't advance with the companies they work for.Gig workers can't build a network with their coworkers because they don't have coworkers...and there's a good chance that they are competing for work with other people working for the same company.There are dead end day jobs, and then there is gig work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a lot of commenters here are projecting this article onto their work lives as tech office workers, but it's really more about the world of unskilled and semi-skilled service/gig workers, like handymen, furniture assemblers, delivery drivers, and so on.All these things can be true and they reinforce each other: The jobs suck &lt;-&gt; The people willing to do them aren't very happy, skilled or competent &lt;-&gt; The pay is minuscule. And we can't seem to get out of this Nash Equilibrium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562119</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The document outlines the Omni AI Benchmark project, which is designed to evaluate and compare the performance of different artificial intelligence models across various tasks. It includes details on installation, usage, and contributions, while providing benchmarks for models on metrics such as accuracy, speed, and efficiency. The goal of the project is to facilitate a standardized assessment of AI capabilities, aiding researchers and developers in selecting the most suitable models for their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 32b sounds like it has some useful small tweakers. Tweaks to make output more human friendly, better mathematical reasoning, better fine-grained understanding. https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464068Qwen2.5-VL-72b was released two months ago (to little fanfare in submissions, i think, but some very enthusiastic comments such as rabid enthusiasm for handwriting recognition) already very interesting. Its actually one of the releases that kind of turned me on to AI, that broke through some of my skepticism &amp; grumpiness. There's pretty good release notes detailing capabilities here; well done blog post. https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/One thing that really piqued my interest was Qwen HTML output, where it can provide bounding boxes in HTML format for its output. That really closes the loop interestingly to me, makes the output something I can imagine quickly building useful visual feedback around, or using the structured data from easily. I can't imagine an easier to use output format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose none of these models can output bounding box coordinates for extracted text? That seems to be a big advantage of traditional OCR over LLMs.For applications I'm interested in, until we can get to 95+% accuracy, it will require human double-checking / corrections, which seems unfeasible w/o bounding boxes to quickly check for errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downloading the MLX version of "Qwen2.5-VL-32b-Instruct -8bit" via LM Studio right now since it's not yet available on Ollama and I can run it locally... I have an OCR side project for it to work on, want to see how performant it is on my M4... will report back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43549072</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a huge fan of Real Genius.  This comes at a real oddly coincidental time...Back when I was probably 16, so '86, I came across Robert Woodhead, probably on Usenet, probably with some mention that he worked on the movie.  So I sent him an e-mail and told him how much I loved the movie.  He wrote back and told me a little about the computer graphics that he did for the movie.  So every time I see some of the graphics scenes, I think of him.A few days ago I was watching a Youtube video "10 things you didn't know about Real Genius", and it showed those computer graphics.And I thought "I wonder what he's up to."  Turns out he's done some kind of interesting things, has a github, etc.  So, I fired off another e-mail to him ("I'm sure you don't remember, but back in '86 you graciously replied to an e-mail I sent you and I've often thought of that kindness.")  He happens to live where I visit typically a couple times a year, so we've set up going out to coffee.2 e-mails, 40 years apart, and then this.  Coincidences, man.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I first saw this film when I was a kid, and it made a lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, it feels like the lesson of the film has not been learned: too many "geniuses" over the past 40 years have failed to consider the negative social consequences of the technology that they create. These naive geniuses are all too happy to solve technical problems and cash paychecks given to them by powers that turn out to be malevolent (despite draping themselves in a costume of benevolence).Question authority, and question your own role in the power structure. It's a moral imperative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From memory, having last seen it in the '80s:"Why do you wear that toy on your head?" "Because if I wear it anywhere else, it...chafes""What's that?" "A laser beam, bozo!" "What are we supposed to do?" "Follow it!""Your stutter has improved" "I've been giving myself shock treatment" "...Up the voltage""You're laborers, you're supposed to be laboring. That's what you get for not having an education!""It's a coherent beam of light" "So that means it talks?"Of course, the non-quote where one of the kids at the study table stands up, screams repeatedly, and leaves, and with no reaction one of the kids at the periphery of the room moves to sit in his place.And of course: "If there's ever anything I can do for you, or, more to the point, to you..." "Can you hammer a six inch spike through a board with your penis?" "Well, not right now..."Real Genius had a significant impact on me...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555334</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the causes and implications of the devastating earthquake that struck Myanmar, focusing on the geological factors that contributed to the disaster. It discusses the region's tectonic activity, particularly the interactions between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The piece highlights the challenges of earthquake prediction and the importance of understanding geological processes to mitigate future risks, as well as the impact of such natural disasters on local communities and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Of course, we don’t know when—that’s always the $1 million question—but you can do the math to find out whether or not it’s within an expected range of time, which we call the recurrence interval.We actually have come up with a very consistent techniques and results  that can predict the upcoming earthquake (more than 7 Mw) based on offline public data within a few days namely short-term prediction instead of the not so useful early detection (after the earthquake event) and the useless forecast (will happen within this decade). The paper have been rejected for many times now by many prominent journals for example Nature and Science, heck it's even rejected by arXiv.org. Apparently it's a taboo to perform a study and claim on short-term earthquake by USGS, and they even make fun of it that I think is pretty childish to put in a professional website [1],[2]. However, based on our results for short-term prediction of offline data, they are very consistent for five recent major earthquakes across five earthquake prones countries.[1] Can you predict earthquakes?https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/faqs/can-you-predict-earthqua...[2] 100% Chance of an Earthquake:https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/100-chance-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked the photo that one of the quoted seismologists, Zhigang Peng from Atlanta, supplied to the author of this article - which depicts the seismologist standing in front of a sign marking the San Andreas fault on a visit to California. Its just the kind of photo a visiting seismotourist would take !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The belt’s tectonic activity has birthed many of the world’s most impressive mountain ranges, including the Alps, the Atlas Mountains, and the Himalayas.I though the Himalayas were formed from the Indian subcontinent slamming into the Eurasian land mass?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533792</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a peculiar incident where a test for the Yarn package manager encountered unexpected errors due to a dependency conflict, specifically around the use of a deprecated package. As the team investigated, they discovered that certain actions inadvertently led to more complex dependency resolution issues, illustrating the intricacies and challenges in managing package dependencies in software development. The post emphasizes the importance of attention to detail in testing and dependency management to avoid such derailments, ultimately reflecting on best practices for developers using Yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the real problem is that Jest just executes to whatever `sl` resolves. The fix they intent to release doesn't address that, but it tries to recognise the train steaming through. How is this acceptable behaviour from a test runner, as it looks like a disaster to happen. What if I have `alias sl=rm -rf /`, as one typically wants to have such a command close at hand?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just from the title, I suspected that Steam Locomotive had something to do with it. So I quickly glanced through the article up to the point where the locomotive shows up. Sometimes there's the idea hanging in my mind to make a version called Slow Locomotive, where the train slows down every time you press ctrl-c.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A useful error message would have made this a 1-minute investigation. The "fix" of trying to detect this specific program is much too narrow. The right fix is to change Yarn to print a message about what it was trying to do (check for a Sapling repo) and what happened instead. This is also likely a systemic problem, so a good engineer would go through the whole program and fix other places that need it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43556280</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the author's personal choice to avoid political discussions with friends, highlighting the potential for conflict and tension such conversations can create. The author reflects on the importance of maintaining friendships and fostering a positive social environment, suggesting that political disagreements can lead to division and resentment. Instead, the piece advocates for focusing on shared interests and experiences, emphasizing the value of preserving relationships over engaging in potentially divisive topics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Article starts off be asserting that they don't talk politics with friends then proceeds to describe how to talk politics with friends?)Friends are people you should support and build up. You shouldn't try to make them feel bad by winning arguments with them. That said- a healthy society is only possible if individuals can exchange ideas about how to run things and then act collectively (aka "politics"). Sometimes people will have different interests and priorities, that lead to them having different ideas about stuff- most of the time this is totally fine.This basically comes down to respect and communication skills- but for god's sake people- keep on talking about "politics"!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess I just don't see "tribalism". I know it's a popular description though for the divisiveness we find ourselves in politically.But I consider the things important to me, the beliefs, the issues: and they, all of them, align with a progressive, left-leaning ideology. I'm not just glomming on to everything one "tribe" or another stands for ... one group actually reflects everything I believe. (I think I could split a few hairs here and there, but we're still talking perhaps 95% alignment.)But I don't think that is too surprising. Others, smarter than me, have gone into great detail about the underpinnings of left-leaning or right-leaning world views in people. Fear of change, empathy ... a number of ideas have been put forth. By this reasoning it naturally follows that those of a certain "personality" will also share common beliefs, ideologies.The implication instead seems to be that unless you are somewhere in the middle of the spectrum you must be "tribal". That feels dismissive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll provide an opposing viewpoint. In the last 10 years, I've lost friendships and family because people in my life have voted for candidates that stripped rights away from women, minorities, etc.Having a vast difference between opinions is fine, but some of their decisions are fundamentally against my core beliefs and have done literal harm to many people I know.For that reason, terminating family and friendships has been absolutely worth it for me.Until we can live in a world where fundamental rights are protected and respected, we have no common ground, and it's pointless to tiptoe around these insanely harmful beliefs while maintaining a facade of friendship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43559605</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods for measuring the efficiency of acceleration structures used in computer graphics, particularly in ray tracing and rendering applications. It emphasizes the importance of benchmarking different structures to optimize performance, presenting various metrics and techniques for evaluating their effectiveness. The author also highlights the trade-offs between complexity and speed, providing insights into selecting the right acceleration structures based on specific use cases and performance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

Less bandwidth required and higher cache hit rate.You can compute a ton per bit transferred from DRAM.

It just re-enables all controls on all &lt;video&gt; elements and uses z-indexing to push them to the top.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the author's experience attending an OpenBSD conference in Amsterdam, where they share insights from discussions, workshops, and personal interactions with community members. It highlights the significance of OpenBSD in the realms of security and software development, and the author's reflections on the collaborative and welcoming nature of the community. The piece serves as an introduction to OpenBSD and encourages others to explore and contribute to this Unix-like operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;i didnt understand it until i stumbled on the bsd supp docs that openbsd couldnt be *** to include. i dont have the sources, but v7 vol2 is close enough:https://s3.amazonaws.com/plan9-bell-labs/7thEdMan/bswv7.htmlfor vi, get the PostScript.ps files for the OTHER manual from bostics sources (openbsd src only has troff source and no troff):https://sites.google.com/a/bostic.com/keithbostic/the-berkel...    echo pkg_add ghostscript | su root
    tar xfz nvi-1.79.tar.gz
    cd nvi-1.79/docs/USD.doc
    (cd vi.ref; ps2pdf vi.ref.ps)
    (cd vi.tut; ps2pdf vi.tut.ps)

the interactive vi tutorial is also great:    ftp -C https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/`uname -r`/SHA256.sig &amp;&amp;
    ftp -C https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/`uname -r`/src.tar.gz &amp;&amp;
    signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-`uname -r|tr -d .`-base.pub -x SHA256.sig src.tar.gz &amp;&amp;
    echo tar xfzCp src.tar.gz /usr/src | su root
    cp /usr/src/usr.bin/vi/docs/tutorial/* ./
    vi vi.beginner
    vi vi.advanced

btw for full openbsd sources you need to do    echo tar xfzCp src.tar.gz   /usr/src      | su root
    echo tar xfzCp sys.tar.gz   /usr/src      | su root
    echo tar xfzCp ports.tar.gz /usr          | su root
    echo tar xfzCp src.tar.gz   /usr/xenocara | su root

wouldnt it be nice if installation did this and syspatch patched it and sysupgrade merged it?
openbsd is also not very good at pointing you to the right manual. making them grepable was a small improvement for me.    mkdir man &amp;&amp; cd man &amp;&amp;
    for n in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    do for m in /usr/share/man/man$n/*
    do man $n `basename $m .$n` | col -b &gt; `basename $m`
    done
    done
    grep 'why is it so broken' *

maybe feed it into a LLM idk. you are now on the beginning of the long, tedious, futile and soul crushing journey of dealing with documentation and source code on openbsd. you will not look back on it thru rose coloured glasses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice read!This really resonated with me:&gt; I would skim the documentation for the command to run, or the configuration to enter, only to get error messages in response. Then a period of frantic searching and trial and error would follow. Until I finally got it right. Once it worked, I reread the original documentation and saw that the answers were right there all along. Crystal clear. And yet somehow it did not register the first time. This happened on multiple occasions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;haha thanks this seems so oddly familiar. setting up openbsd on a vps slowly. each problem as you write, stumped, searching frustratedly. only to find the answer staring me in the face in the docs i definitely tried to read the first time round :')... getting slowly more into the 'read it slowly and take notes'. litterally every issue :D. they say these man pages / docs are the best. they really are. maybe there is some learning curve to transition from bad documentation to good documentation...either way, thanks for writeup, definitely going to reread it better and maybe it will save me some fallingonmyface soon!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533151</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The website explores the intersection of machine learning and digital art, focusing on how artificial intelligence can be utilized to create unique artworks. It discusses various techniques used in generative art, including algorithmic processes and neural networks, and showcases examples of artworks produced using these technologies. Additionally, the site delves into the implications of machine-generated art on creativity, authorship, and the evolving landscape of the art world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this work by Otoro / David Ha.For come context, this uses a technique called CPPN’s (compositional pattern producing networks), where the inputs are (x, y, sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and then there are several neural net layers with different activation functions and randomly initialized weights. It actually resembles the optical physics of light reflecting through glass (which explains why it sometimes looks like light reflecting through a gem).Otoro wrote some great blog posts on this:https://blog.otoro.net/2016/03/25/generating-abstract-patter...https://blog.otoro.net/2015/07/31/neurogram/https://github.com/hardmaru/cppn-tensorflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the risk of sounding like an idiot. What even is this? Is there a purpose? It looks just like random pixel generation to me. There is no explanation anywhere I can find on a "purpose" or "motivation".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523633</guid></item><item><title>44.

The details don't matter at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One nice side effect of Signal's importance for governmental/military use is that it helps keep it free for civilian use.  They can't mandate a backdoor for something other parts of the government rely on to be secure.I once heard a great anecdote to that effect, and to my embarrassment I can't recall the details to repeat here.(And yes, I understand that there are limits on what is appropriate to share with civilian hardware on a civilian network, but the truth stands that part of the reason there's not a push to breach encryption in the US like there is in the UK is because Signal is relied upon even by the government when they need a private channel on civilian hardware.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560336</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article details a project in which the author converts a go-kart into an extreme, dangerous vehicle often referred to as a "deathtrap." It outlines the design choices, modifications, and safety considerations involved in transforming the go-kart to enhance speed and performance, while also highlighting the risks associated with such an undertaking. The narrative blends technical insights with humor, ultimately showcasing a blend of engineering creativity and a disregard for conventional safety practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice project!Did you know that instead of buying new motor controllers, you can re-use the hoverboard motor controller? Awesome people have made open source firmware you can flash to it: https://github.com/EFeru/hoverboard-firmware-hack-FOC. With this firmware you can make the motors go way faster, up to 40km/h with a 12S battery.We are also building a kart with hoverboard motors, with a custom welded steel frame. Vibrations are a real issue with the standard solid rubber wheels, hopefully I can find the same air tires you used!Our website is in Dutch, but you can watch the videos: https://projects.raphson.nl/projects/kart/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe this will help someone to not over-engineer a kart: in Vietnam you can rent karts bolted onto hoverboards. They have pedals for forward/backward that just tilt the hoverboard in the right direction. Very low-cost solution. Steering is normal with the front wheels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a great project overall but MDF is a very poor choice for the base. It will get destroyed as soon as it gets wet. At minimum they should have used exterior grade plywood, and painted it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43525129</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a framework for evaluating AI agents, proposing a "litmus test" to assess their capabilities and effectiveness. It emphasizes the importance of defining clear criteria for measuring the performance and reliability of AI systems in various tasks. The author outlines specific metrics, including decision-making speed, accuracy, and adaptability, to ensure that AI agents can function autonomously and responsively in real-world scenarios. Overall, the piece aims to provide guidance for developers and organizations in creating and implementing robust AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anthropic has a definition:  Workflows are systems where  LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
  Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks

https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-age...While I know it's a marketing term, I think a good distinction is that agents have a loop in the execution graph, and can choose whether to loop or keep going. Workflows are chained LLM calls where the LLM has no "choice".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Our litmus test for AI agents: Does the AI system perform actions under its own identity?So service accounts are agents? This seems pretty thin.In AI an "agent" is simply any code/workflow/automation that utilizes an LLM to respond to broadly defined external/environmental stimuli and decide how to react given broadly defined motivations and/or objectives.Not agent: Document comes in -&gt; If invoice return key-value pairs to make API call with.Agent: Document comes in -&gt; You're a finance professional: decided what to do with this document. Here are the tools/actions available to you: X, Y, Z.Both use AI and can achieve the same thing, but one is "agentic", while the other is deterministic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a bit amusing that so much ink has been spilled over what the definition of an “AI agent” is.I don’t care. I care what your software can do. I don’t care if it’s called AI or machine learning or black magic. I care if it can accomplish a task reliably so that I don’t have to do it myself or pay someone to do it.We had the same argument about 3 years ago when everyone started calling things “AI”. They use LLMs to generate text. Usually they have outsourced all of the interesting technical work to a handful of providers backed by big Web 2.0 companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560849</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impressive!35 kLOC is quite a bit. I wonder how straightforward and maintainable this app ended up to be. This would require taking a look at the sources. While good Rails code tends to be very terse, frontend may be quite voluminous.&gt; I believe within a couple of months, when things like log tailing and automated testing and native version control get implementedThis sounds a bit too optimistic, especially around automated testing, but yes, eventually this all will be there.&gt; an extremely powerful tool for even non-technical people to write production-quality appsBut why would non-technical people would even think in terms of log tailing and version control, any more than they think about the gauge of wiring in their walls, or the kind of modulation their Wi-Fi device use? For really non-technical audience to make a good use of such tools, it won't just take the AI to be a competent coder. The AI should become a competent architect and a competent senior SWE to translate from the product management language to the software development language, without even surfacing it when not explicitly asked. It's going to be quite a bit of a challenge to make it work, and work about as reliably as with a human team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also wrote a recipe simplifying website, so this is a fun project to see. Incredible work!Probably the main value engineers have for a maintenance project is context. I wonder what happens when we fully cede context to the machines...Today, I got a request at work for a feature ("let's offer coupons!") that I thought would take a week. That was until I found out that another engineer wrote most of the code last year, and it'd take him a day to dust off.I'm totally onboard with, and grateful for, larger-scale experiments like this...thanks for putting the effort in. I wonder how well Cursor (or similar) would handle a situation in which large amounts of code are _almost_ being used. What if 3k LOC accidentally get duplicated? Can our automated systems understand that and fix it? Because if they can't, a human is going to spend a _long_ time trying to figure out what happened.Over the next 18 months, I expect we'll hear a few stories of the LLM accidentally reimplementing an entire feature in a separate code path. It's a whole new class of bugs! :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help! I just made the Diarrhea Walnuts (https://www.recipeninja.ai/recipe/r_N1VSPtXzCJVV3l/diarrhea-...) recipe and it turns out I am allergic to Walnuts! I am throwing up everywhere!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One aspect of computer screen eye strain is the extra-ocular muscles not exploring using their full range on motion and instead being focused on the center of their field of vision non-stop. I went for a demo of the Apple Vision Pro hoping to have my whole field of view be one giant screen. Instead, the center is sharp and the periphery is extremely blurry. I was told this is to save on video processing resources.  To make something sharp you have to move my whole head to look face it directly. It didn't even come close to having as much useful field of view as a nice setup with a couple of monitors. It was really not what I was hoping for.The article promises that AR glasses will "keep the visual field broad and wide."  Maybe products will fix this in future iterations, but I'm not too hopeful for the near future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "peripheral area of the retina continuously contacts sunlight" part is just wishful thinking at this point. Every company in this space except Xreal has abandoned the idea of a see-through display, and Xreal has only kept it because their focus is on weight and comfort over features and it lets them avoid needing passthrough cameras and everything that goes with them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone else reading this comparing it with their personal experience using AR devices and thinking that the current devices Oculus/Apple Vision Pro devices feel like they are increasing eyestrain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43552385</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is no one going to mention that the first picture is AI generated tosh?  I understand that generating a picture is easier than taking a nice picture, in a nice place with a a nice camera - but the back row of the board is all white and the second row.. sort of disappears!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cute and I'm glad someone is doing that, but it's too small and out of proportion for tournaments etc.  You want squares of about 2.25 inches and king height of 3.75 inches, about.  If you're going to all the trouble of magnetic sensors and whatnot, you might as well make the board and pieces meet the relevant standards.These days, image recognition is good enough that it's probably feasible to just video the chess game on a non-sensory board, and let software figure out what moves were played.  In cases of doubt or dispute (blitz scrambles), humans can examine the video.If anyone cares, the tournament sensory sets that most organizers use are made by DGT and cost around $600 iirc.  The magnetic sensor system is very clever and was patented in the 1990s or so, but the patents would be expired by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I’m missing something, but why have a single piece PCB instead of individual parts with a 3D printed slot for the sensor and LED.A few wires later and a model scale up and your chess board can be a different size.I suppose one piece is easier and cleaner, just less flexible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526118</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's true that free trade is hugely beneficial to the US economy as a whole, particularly with the USD being the reserve currency.The flow of goods is balanced by a flow of US dollars to other countries, which are ultimately cycled back into the US financial system - enabling budget deficits and an abundance of capital to invest in high growth industries.The flip side of this is that it also drives inequality - the upside of this system is felt by the entrepreneurs, investors and high-skill employees in tech and finance, while the downside is concentrated with low-skill workers whose jobs are offshored to lower wage countries.The obvious solution is not to hurt the economy as a whole, but rather for the government to lower the cost of high-quality education, build out social systems, and invest into onshoring select strategic industries by raising taxes at the high end.As such, this administration's policies are foolish, but many on this very site would need to give up a little bit of their privilege to reduce the pain felt by many of their fellow citizens.That is something that in the current American political climate seems a nearly impossible sell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From what I understand, de minimis exemption has also been removed.That is a huge, huge deal. It effectively means that all goods imported from China will be slapped with a 30% import tax, as soon as said goods arrive the US border / customs.Usually what happens then, is that the courier will pay that tax, and then bill the recipient later on - as well as charge some fee/fees for the work done.This is why in some European countries, that $1 item from China with free shipping can end up costing $10, because you're paying $0.25 in VAT or import taxes, and $10 to the shipping courier for doing the paperwork.If that is the case in the US, I fully expect total chaos and mayhem when all the Temu / AliExpress/ Wish customers start receiving extra bills for their orders.(That's just from the most obvious consumer example...then you have pretty much everything else. Goods, commodities, etc.)EDIT: I found more info here https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-pr...So it is even worse, you either pay $25 per shipment, or 30% - whichever is higher. Then later it moves up to $50 per shipment, or 30% - whichever is higher.a $1 item with $1 shipping will end up costing you as much as $52 after June!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aside from everything else one thing what strikes me as particularly insane is how it’s not even defensible as a protective measure. My favorite everyday olive oil comes from Tunisia. They now have a 38% tariff on them. There are no out of work olive farmers in the US.The orange man wanted tariffs, the orange man is going to get tariffs. Now we have to hope the American people aren’t so dumb as to still be convinced only he can solve their issues. I don’t hold out hope for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43561253</guid></item><item><title>3.

A lot of the "Thinkpad fans" I've talked to genuinely want them, or respect them for similar reasons they enjoy the ThinkPad legacy.ThinkPads are durable but every day they get older, slower and more difficult to source parts for as collectors entrench themselves and the requirements of operating systems (and the "modern web") worsenFramework laptops are wonderful, modern and (arguably?) cheaper to own in the long-term thanks to being able to replace components, particularly the entire mainboard as time progresses.*But* they're a tiny boutique manufacturer. Their barrier to entry is that of a pretty hefty modern laptop, versus buying a T420 for practically pennies and performing all kinds of aftermarket "mods" to it. 51nb's "FrankenPads" especially breathe incredible new life into old IBM and Lenovo stock.Combine this with the fact that being the "defacto business laptop" for nearly three decades (along with perhaps Dell) means there's enough Thinkpads on Earth to probably stretch end-to-end around the moon and back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally I think beyond T450 generation, i.e. over 10 years old systems, you are starting to make pretty severe compromises. T440 generation had really bad Trackpoint setup, and older hardware starts to lose features. Random stuff that T450 has that T400 doesn't* USB3* Up to 32 GB of RAM (vs max 8 GB for T400)* M.2 slot (for SSD), 6 Gb/s SATA (vs 1.5 Gb/s on T400)* x86-64-v3 (AVX2 etc) and OpenGL 4.6* Dual-band AC wifi and BT4.0 (optional 4G LTE WWAN)* DisplayPort with 4k@60Hz output* Slightly larger screen estate (1600x900 vs 1440x900), with FHD 1080p display option* Dramatically better battery life* Backlit keyboardMany of these are not merely nice to have but also ensure longevity by being compatible with lot of other modern stuff. On the other hand I do believe that T450 generation device might remain viable daily driver for a long while still. From the specs the biggest obvious shortcoming to me is the lack of USB-C, especially USB-C charging. But besides that, it seems pretty usable system.For reference, I have old X240 that I still occasionally use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tightness of hardware integration isn't a bug, it's genuinely a feature; In fact, it's the defining feature that makes Apple hardware great. Socketed RAM, CPU, and Storage just weren't worth the tradeoffs, namely size, weight, cost, and performance. Including those modular interfaces just wasn't worth it when the internal interfaces would be obsolete within 5 years, and the average user was replacing sub-components 0 times over the life of the device.The user being able to swap parts easily is _neat_ but it's just not an required feature, any more than the user of a car being able to easily hot-swap the engine. The right level of integration provides a tradeoff the maximizes reliability, cost, performance, and repair. A professional can still replace almost any component of a modern laptop, with a few thousand $ of specialized tools, and the battery, the only component with a fixed lifetime, can be easily replaced at home.I really hope Framework can continue to develop hardware with documented repairability, without falling for the myth that tight integration and quality are mutually exclusive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564111</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an imaginative exploration of an archeologist-adventurer character, delving into their journey and discoveries in ancient sites. It emphasizes the intersection of history and adventure, portraying the archeologist as a figure who uncovers hidden stories and artifacts, while also reflecting on the modern implications of their findings. The piece captures the excitement of exploration and the importance of preserving historical narratives in a contemporary context.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if anyone is interested in this story, but I remember at the height of the PokemonGo craze I noticed there were no shirts for the different factions in the game, cant rememebr what they were called but something like Teamread or something. I setup an online shop to just to sell a red shirt with the word on it. The next day my whole shop was taken offline for potential copyright infringement.What I found surprising is I didnt even have one sale. Somehow someone had notified Nintendo AND my shop had been taken down, to sell merch that didn't even exist for the market and if I remember correctly - also it didnt even have any imagery on it or anything trademarkable -  even if it was clearly meant for pokmeonGo fans.Im not bitter I just found it interesting how quick and ruthless they were.  Like bros I didn't even get a chance to make a sale.   ( yes and also I dont think I infringed anything).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't condone or endorse breaking any laws.That said, trademark laws like life of the author + 95 years are absolutely absurd. The ONLY reason to have any law prohibiting unlicensed copying of intangible property is to incentivize the creation of intangible property. The reasoning being that if you don't allow people to exclude 3rd party copying, then the primary party will assumedly not receive compensation for their creation and they'll never create.Even in the case where the above is assumed true, the length of time that a protection should be afforded should be no more than the length of time necessary to ensure that creators create.There are approximately zero people who decide they'll create something if they're protected for 95 years after their death but won't if it's 94 years. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same for 1 year past death.For that matter, this argument extends to other criminal penalties, but that's a whole other subject.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idk, the models generating what are basically 1:1 copies of the training data from pretty generic descriptions feels like a severe case of overfitting to me. What use is a generational model that just regurgitates the input?I feel like the less advanced generations, maybe even because of their limitations in terms of size, were better at coming up with something that at least feels new.In the end, other than for copyright-washing, why wouldn't I just use the original movie still/photo in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573156</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;Headscale is an open-source implementation of the Tailscale control plane, allowing users to set up a self-hosted, private mesh VPN powered by WireGuard. It enables seamless communication between devices while maintaining user control over their network. The repository provides documentation on installation, configuration, and management of Headscale, along with various features such as authentication, access control, and integration with other services. The project aims to offer a secure, efficient networking solution for individuals and organizations looking for alternatives to commercial VPN services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every few months I come back to this repo to check if they finally got Tailnet lock running or if someone security audited them in the meanwhile. Unfortunately neither of these things seem to make any progress and thus, I’ve grown uncertain in how much I can trust this as a core part of my infrastructure.The entire premise of Tailscale SaaS builds on creating tunnels around your firewalls, then enabling the user to police what is allowed to be routed through these tunnels in a intuitive and unified way.Headscale seems to have nailed down the part of bypassing the firewall and doing fancy NAT-traversal, but can they also fulfill the second part by providing enough of their own security to make up for anything they just bypassed, or will they descend to just being a tool for exposing anything to the internet to fuck around with your local network admin?
To me, not giving your Tailscale implementation any way for the user to understand or veto what the control server is instructing the clients to do while also not auditing your servers code at all sure seems daring…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in self-hosting your orchestration server, you can look into Netbird. It's a very similar tool, but has the server open sourced as well. So you have a self-hosted control server with a nice GUI and all the features the paid version does.https://netbird.io/knowledge-hub/tailscale-vs-netbird&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it would be neat if headscale allowed peering / federating between instances. (Maybe after the ACL rework.) One of the main problems is address collisions.So here's my proposal: commit to ipv6-only overlay network in the unique local address (ULA) range, then split up the remaining 121 bits into 20 low bits for device addresses (~1M) and 101 high bits that are the hash of the server's public key. Federate by adding the public key of the other instance and use policy and ACLs to manage comms between nodes.I think it's a nice idea, but the maintainer kradalby said it's out of scope when I brought it up in 2023: https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/issues/1370&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563396</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to implement CSS-only Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) to enhance user experience by improving perceived performance during image loading. It explains the technique of using blurred images as placeholders while the full-resolution images load, providing a smooth visual transition. The post details the necessary CSS properties and techniques to achieve this effect, including examples and code snippets. Overall, it serves as a practical guide for web developers looking to optimize image display on their sites.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool, I love seeing folks use CSS in clever ways. :)My one feedback would be to avoid using attr selectors on the style attribute like [style*="--lqip:"]. Browsers normally lazy compute that string version of the style attribute [1], but if you use a selector like this then on every style recalc it'll force all new inline styles (ex. element.style.foo = bar) to compute the string version.Instead if you use a separate boolean attribute (or even faster a class) it'll avoid that perf foot gun. So write &lt;div lqip style="--lqip: ..."&gt; and match on that.[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:thi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's obviously mostly an aesthetic nitpick for this blog post specifically and not the project itself, because few people are going to be exploring the encoded space outside of the blog post, but the sliders letting you explore the LQIP space would "flash" a lot less if the base color was encoded in the high bits instead of the low bits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since there're independent Lightness values set for each section (I'd say quadrant but there are 6 of them), I wonder if two bits can be shaved from the `L` value from the base color. It'd take some reshuffling and might not play well with color customization in mainly flat images, but I think it could work.I'm also curious to see that they're doing solely grayscale radial gradients over the base color instead of tweaking the base color's `L` value and using that as the radial gradient's center, I'd imagine you'd be doing more math that way in the OKLab colorspace which might give prettier results(?).Tempted to play around with this myself, it's a really creative idea with a lot of potential. Maybe even try moving the centers (picking from a list of pre-defined options with the two bits stolen from the base color's L channel), to account for varying patterns (person portraits, quadrant-based compositions, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523220</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the foundational aspects of software development, focusing on the importance of clarity in programming language design and the need for formal specifications. It emphasizes that precise definitions are crucial for understanding and preventing ambiguities that can lead to errors in software implementation. The text outlines various approaches to defining computational concepts and the implications of these definitions on programming practices. Overall, it advocates for a rigorous and systematic approach to programming to enhance reliability and effectiveness in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are sticking up for LLMs here and that's cool.I wonder, what if you did the opposite?  Take a project of moderate complexity and convert it from code back to natural language using your favorite LLM.  Does it provide you with a reasonable description of the behavior and requirements encoded in the source code without losing enough detail to recreate the program?  Do you find the resulting natural language description is easier to reason about?I think there's a reason most of the vibe-coded applications we see people demonstrate are rather simple.  There is a level of complexity and precision that is hard to manage. Sure, you can define it in plain english, but is the resulting description extensible, understandable, or more descriptive than a precise language?  I think there is a reason why legalese is not plain English, and it goes beyond mere gatekeeping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of this old quote from Hal Abelson:"Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that "computer science" is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology—the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is". Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to"."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally someone put it this way! Natural language has embedded limitations that stem from our own mental limitations -the human mind thinks sometimes too abstract or too specific things, and misses important details or generalizations.As a programmer, I know first hand that the problems or even absurdities of some assignments only become apparent after one has begun implement the code as code, i.e. as strict symbolisms.Not to mention that it often takes more time to explain something accurately in natural language than it takes to just write the algorithm as code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564386</guid></item><item><title>8.

It wasn't like that a while ago, e.g. when Coursera started, or it is not like that if you look at older MIT videos.Does it reflect university teachers getting younger?

&lt;p&gt;Curl-impersonate is a Python library designed to facilitate the use of HTTP requests while bypassing bot detection mechanisms. It leverages the capabilities of cURL, allowing users to mimic real browser requests and avoid being flagged as bots by implementing techniques like managing cookies, headers, and user-agent strings. The library aims to simplify the process of making web requests in a way that appears more human-like, making it particularly useful for web scraping and automated interactions with websites that employ bot protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, it is using cURL proper for networking. That is probably going to have some challenges (I think cURL is still limited in some ways, e.g. I don't think it can do WebSockets over h2 yet) but on the other hand, having a rising browser engine might eventually remove this avenue for fingerprinting since legitimate traffic will have the same fingerprint as stock cURL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait a sec… if the TLS handshakes look different, would it be possible to have an nginx level filter for traffic that claims to be a web browser (eg chrome user agent), yet really is a python/php script? Because this would account for the vast majority of malicious bot traffic, and I would love to just block it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571099</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a backend person, sometimes I look at what's being done for front end stuff and pull back in ever so slight horror.It's an excellent article, and the work within is very well done, but there's a part of me that screams "Why would you introduce this much complexity for what should be a simple scroll?" (overcoming technical hurdles to produce the desired end result aside).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One could ask: what's the UX purpose of the "active anchor" indicator on the side navigation?One answer I can think of: if a reader is in the middle of a long section, and the heading is off the screen, it can remind them which section they're in relative to the others.This indicates (to me, anyway) that it's not a function of which heading you've scrolled to; it's a function of which section is on screen. If you use section-screen-area or something similar to highlight the active section, fiddling with the heading positions becomes unnecessary.If you have a tiny section at the end that can never take up the majority of the screen, then when the user is reading it, the active indicator won't really be useful anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I clicked, thinking that it was perhaps someone who like me was annoyed by Jira's anchors/permalinks which is a &lt;span&gt; with a &lt;button&gt; with a JS event listener on click to load what would normally be an &lt;a href&gt; into the DOM.But this, this is similar, but different. I can't navigate to anchors with for example the keyboard.Question for the author: Why not use the HTML &lt;a&gt; element rather than a JS event listener on a non-interactive element?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43570324</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a personal journey of the author who travels 600 miles to attend an organ recital in a small church. The narrative explores the significance of music and the communal experience of live performances, reflecting on the nuances of attending such events in a world increasingly dominated by digital entertainment. The author contemplates the purpose of their journey and the emotions stirred by the organ music, ultimately finding value in the connection and experience of shared cultural moments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some art-haters in the comments, so to defend this piece of contemporary art for a moment: one thing I love about it is a commitment to the long future of art, creativity, and civilization. What does it take to keep an instrument playing for six hundred years? To commit to that idea -- like the century-long projects of cathedral building in the middle ages, or the idea of planting trees you won't live to see mature -- is (to me) the awesome thing about the Halberstadt performance. All rendered in a medium (church organ) that has existed for an even longer time.It's a pretty hopeful, optimistic view of the future in a time of high uncertainty, but also represents a positive argument: it's worth doing these things because they are interesting, weird, and fun, and because they represent a continuity with past and future people we will never meet.Plus, you can already buy a ticket to the finale, so your distant descendants can go see it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;639 years? Big deal, The Long Now foundation built a clock to last 10,000 years. I hate John Cage since I got his massive world-wide hit 4′33″ stuck in my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am so happy that this is in my HN feed today.I wish there was more stuff like this, both in my feed and in the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535937</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that it was ever seriously entertained that a "chain of thought" was giving some kind of insight into the internal processes of an LLM bespeaks the lack of rigor in this field. The words that are coming out of the model are generated to optimize for RLHF and closeness to the training data, that's it! They aren't references to internal concepts, the model is not aware that it's doing anything so how could it "explain itself"?CoT improves results, sure. And part of that is probably because you are telling the LLM to add more things to the context window, which increases the potential of resolving some syllogism in the training data: One inference cycle tells you that "man" has something to do with "mortal" and "Socrates" has something to do with "man", but two cycles will spit those both into the context window and lets you get statistically closer to "Socrates" having something to do with "mortal". But given that the training/RLHF for CoT revolves around generating long chains of human-readable "steps", it can't really be explanatory for a process which is essentially statistical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was under the impression that CoT works because spitting out more tokens = more context = more compute used to "think." Using CoT as a way for LLMs "show their working" never seemed logical, to me. It's just extra synthetic context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There’s no specific reason why the reported Chain-of-Thought must accurately reflect the true reasoning process;Isn't the whole reason for chain-of-thought that the tokens sort of are the reasoning process?Yes, there is more internal state in the model's hidden layers while it predicts the next token - but that information is gone at the end of that prediction pass. The information that is kept "between one token and the next" is really only the tokens themselves, right? So in that sense, the OP would be wrong.Of course we don't know what kind of information the model encodes in the specific token choices - I.e. the tokens might not mean to the model what we think they mean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43572374</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The list of dropped components is quite large. The cryptsetup, cryptenroll, unified kernel images, kernel signing and systemd-boot work nicely together.I think Systemd has a view that those things should reliably work together. I do not fancy a revival of the past where the user has to cobble a mesh of hopefully compatible libraries to achieve the same, taking weeks to study the Arch manual and resolving tons of gotcha's, all to be broken by next week's update.The integration of all this stuff is now actively under test and maintenance with systemd.And yes, the mentioned services also have an impact on the scope of service managing. Because if you have a unit that depends on a disk that needs to be unencrypted, this has to be resolved somehow in the right time.I personally have had no need for systemd-resolved, but I think for *desktop* the list of droppable components is not large.So maybe we should first have a conversation about the *desktop* vs *container-os* purpose?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an impressive project especially considering there are only 4 contributors.  In my opinion this should have existed prior to systemd as it is more modular and very much optional "The Suite may run either as an init system or as an auxiliary service management system under another init system."  This would have been a much better direction to go on Redhat in my opinion.  I might still be using CentOS or one of the forks had systemd gone this direction.  Just a personal preference of course but this does not feel forced and does not appear to commandeer functionality that should not be in the init process.  It's also interesting to see it implemented in Alpine Linux already though I do not see it in the edge repo guess I have to build it.  I use Alpine for all my VM and bare metal servers.  This may be worth tinkering with.  After this is extensively battle hardened I would like to see this as an installation option in Alpine, perhaps by setting a variable much like other installation options.  There are also some interesting notes in Myths and Truths [1]I hope they are still actively developing this. last 5 commit dates which appear low for an alpha.  Maybe we need to contribute to this or raise funding.    Date:   Fri Aug 16 18:55:06 2024 +0100

What were they thinking?That said, this sounds like what systemd should have been: a service control manager and nothing more, before they got a thirst for power and wanted to control any and every thing about the system.But one of those already exists, it's called launchd, as long as you don't mind XML vs Windows INI syntax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43568503</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the potential advancements and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) by the year 2027. It covers predictions for technological developments, the integration of AI in various industries, ethical considerations, and the importance of regulatory frameworks. The content emphasizes the transformative nature of AI on society, the economy, and daily life, while also addressing potential challenges and the need for collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and the public to harness AI's benefits responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s good science fiction, I’ll give it that. I think getting lost in the weeds over technicalities ignores the crux of the narrative: even if this doesn’t lead to AGI, at the very least it’s likely the final “warning shot” we’ll get before it’s suddenly and irreversibly here.The problems it raises - alignment, geopolitics, lack of societal safeguards - are all real, and happening now (just replace “AGI” with “corporations”, and voila, you have a story about the climate crisis and regulatory capture). We should be solving these problems before AGI or job-replacing AI becomes commonplace, lest we run the very real risk of societal collapse or species extinction.The point of these stories is to incite alarm, because they’re trying to provoke proactive responses while time is on our side, instead of trusting self-interested individuals in times of great crisis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though I think it is probably mostly science-fiction, this is one of the more chillingly thorough descriptions of potential AGI takeoff scenarios that I've seen. I think part of the problem is that the world you get if you go with the "Slowdown"/somewhat more aligned world is still pretty rough for humans: What's the point of our existence if we have no way to meaningfully contribute to our own world?I hope we're wrong about a lot of this, and AGI turns out to either be impossible, or much less useful than we think it will be. I hope we end up in a world where humans' value increases, instead of decreasing. At a minimum, if AGI is possible, I hope we can imbue it with ethics that allow it to make decisions that value other sentient life.Do I think this will actually happen in two years, let alone five or ten or fifty? Not really. I think it is wildly optimistic to assume we can get there from here - where "here" is LLM technology, mostly. But five years ago, I thought the idea of LLMs themselves working as well as they do at speaking conversational English was essentially fiction - so really, anything is possible, or at least worth considering."May you live in interesting times" is a curse for a reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones.Yeah nah, theres a key thing missing here, the number of jobs created needs to be more than the ones it's destroyed, and they need to be better paying and happen in time.History says that actually when this happens, an entire generation is yeeted on to the streets (see powered looms, Jacquard machine, steam powered machine tools) All of that cheap labour needed to power the new towns and cities was created by automation of agriculture and artisan jobs.Dark satanic mills were fed the decedents of once reasonably prosperous crafts people.AI as presented here will kneecap the wages of a good proportion of the decent paying jobs we have now. This will cause huge economic disparities, and probably revolution. There is a reason why the royalty of Europe all disappeared when they did...So no, the stock market will not be growing because of AI, it will be in spite of it.Plus china knows that unless they can occupy most of its population with some sort of work, they are finished. AI and decent robot automation are an existential threat to the CCP, as much as it is to what ever remains of the "west"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571851</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an interview with a university president addressing the issue of cowardice in academia and leadership. He emphasizes the importance of courage in confronting challenging societal issues, advocating for open dialogue and the need to take a stand against injustice. The discussion highlights the pressures faced by educators and leaders to conform or avoid controversy, as well as the vital role that brave decision-making plays in fostering a more engaged and responsible academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/a9ie5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh hey, Wesleyan on HN! I’m an alumnus (matriculated a year or two after Roth became president). Wesleyan has a rich history of activism and protest, and not always entirely peaceful (Roth’s predecessor, Doug Bennet, had his office firebombed at one point).I’ve had a few opportunities to speak with Roth since the Gaza war started, and I’ve always found him particularly thoughtful about balancing freedom of expression with a need to provide a safe and open learning environment for everyone on campus. In particular, he never gave in to the unlimited demands of protestors while still defending their right to protest.In part, he had the moral weight to do that because—unlike many university presidents—he did not give in to the illiberal demands of the left to chill speech post-2020, which then were turned against the left over the past year.I don’t see any particularly good outcome from any of this; the risk of damaging the incredibly successful American university system is high. Certainly smart foreign students who long dreamed of studying in the US will be having second thoughts if they can be arbitrarily and indefinitely detained.But I hope the universities that do make it through do with a stronger commitment to the (small l) liberal values of freedom of expression , academic freedom, and intellectual diversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't see much talk of donors? My impression is that, as in many situations, the super-wealthy are forming a dominant class - as if it's their right - rather than respect democracy and freedom, and attacking university freedom. Didn't some person engineer the Harvard leader's exit?Roth says the Wesleyan board is supportive; maybe they are just lucky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43568655</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the theoretical foundations of gauge theories in high-energy physics, particularly focusing on the implications of non-abelian gauge symmetries. It discusses the role of gauge invariance in formulating physical laws and its impact on the behavior of fundamental particles. The paper highlights various aspects, including the derivation of the Yang-Mills equations and their solutions, as well as the relationship between gauge theories and the standard model of particle physics. The researchers aim to clarify complex concepts and provide insights into the mathematical structures underpinning modern theoretical physics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the magical thing that happens when AI research happens in the open. Deepseek published their model and their methodology and then the nice people at the University of Illinois are able to build on it.When OpenAI was launched this is what I thought it was going to be like. Something, something for the betterment of man kind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of comments. What’s not that interesting here is that adding search to an LLM increases accuracy — this is known, and largely implemented via RAG or other search pipelines which then stuff information into the context.What might be interesting here is that they are thinking about taxonomic tool use-cases, and exploring training and therefore optimizing the utilization of them.This to me is a proof of concept — an interesting one, but just a proof of concept. You can see from their example search that the model over-relied on search; it didn’t need to re-search three times to get the answer.A next step that I think would be useful would be updating the reward function to penalize search; pressing the model to use search when it needs to and not before. This to me is a likely framework going forward where MCP tool costing matters, and would be really useful to have in the next gen of tool calling LLMs.In the case of search we’d hopefully get a really useful signal and outcome for times the model is unsure — it would call a friend, and get good info! And for times it’s sure, we’d have taught it not to waste reward on that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool. I have a similar model that’s 8 days into training on msmarco.So far I only have the “cold start” data posted, but I’m planning on posting a full distillation dataset.https://huggingface.co/datasets/dleemiller/lm25&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563265</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally like trackballs with a large central ball where I can use all my fingers. I am aware Ploopy offers one. This style however has fallen out of popularity, but I've been using them since the mid-90s.Just using your thumb for all navigation seems like an RSI waiting to happen.Also I don't know who in the last couple years decided it's a "Trackball Mouse" it's just a Trackball in the same way it's just a "Trackpad" and not a "Trackpad Mouse"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have deformities in my wrist and I have small palms (dwarfism) I’ve tried various kinds of mice; none of them were comfortable and settled on using a Wacom tablet as a trackpad.Recently I started using Logitech Ergo M575 trackball  mice and it has been total game changer, I can even play FPS games quite well with it. I highly recommend trackball for those with accessibility issues like me and certainly welcome more open hardware competitors in the space like Ploopy as customisation is crucial for accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These types of mice are just not for me but I looked at some of their other products and honestly the thing I like most about them is how everything is open source.Ironically I think the fact that they open source their designs probably helps sales. My first reaction is to scoff at the $144 price tag but I know that if I go look at what it will take to build one myself I’m sure the $144 price tag will become much more reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43522060</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The premise might possibly be true, but as an actually seasoned Python developer, I've taken a look at one file: https://github.com/dx-tooling/platform-problem-monitoring-co...All of it smells of a (lousy) junior software engineer: from configuring root logger at the top, module level (which relies on module import caching not to be reapplied), over not using a stdlib config file parser and building one themselves, to a raciness in load_json where it's checked for file existence with an if and then carrying on as if the file is certainly there...In a nutshell, if the rest of it is like this, it simply sucks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a long time hobby coder, like 25 years and I think I’m pretty good(?), this whole LLM /vibecoding thing has zapped my creativity the past year or so. I like the craft of making things. I used tools I enjoy working with and learn new ones all the time (never got on the JS/react train). Sometimes I have an entrepreneur bug and want to create a marketable solution, but I often just like to build. Im also the kind of guy that has a shop he built, builds his own patio deck, home remodeling, Tinker with robotics, etc. Kind of just like to be a maker following my own creative pursuit.All said, it’s hard on me knowing it’s possible to use llm to spit out a crappy but functional version of whatever I’ve dreamt up with out satisfaction of building it. Yet, it also seems to now be demotivating to spend the time crafting it when I know I could use llm to do a majority of it. So, I’m in a mental quagmire, this past year has been the first year since at least 2000 that I haven’t built anything significant in scale. It’s indirectly ruining the fun for me for some reason. Kind of just venting but curious if anyone else feels this way too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aah.. I have been repeating this to my team for several days now. Thanks for putting this together.I start every piece of work, green or brown, with a markdown file that often contains my plan, task breakdown, data models (including key fields), API / function details, and sample responses.For the tool part, though, I took a slightly different approach. I decided to use Rust primarily for all my projects, as the compile-time checks are a great way to ensure the correctness of the generated code. I have noticed many more errors are detected in AI-generated Rust code than in any other language. I am happy about it because these are errors that I would have missed in other languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573755</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Simply change the domain from github.com or github.io to gitmcp.io and get instant AI context for any GitHub repository.What does this mean? How does it work? How can I understand how it works? The requirements, limitations, constraints? The landing page tells me nothing! Worse, it doesn't have any links or suggestions as to how I could possibly learn how it works.&gt; Congratulations! The chosen GitHub project is now fully accessible to your AI.What does this mean??&gt; GitMCP serves as a bridge between your GitHub repository's documentation and AI assistants by implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). When an AI assistant requires information from your repository, it sends a request to GitMCP. GitMCP retrieves the relevant content and provides semantic search capabilities, ensuring efficient and accurate information delivery.MCP is a protocol that defines a number of concrete resource types (tools, prompts, etc.) -- each of which have very specific behaviors, semantics, etc. -- and none of which are identified by this project's documentation as what it actually implements!Specifically what aspects of the MCP are you proxying here? Specifically how do you parse a repo's data and transform it into whatever MCP resources you're supporting? I looked for this information and found it nowhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some context.1. Some LLMs support function calling. That means they are given a list of tools with descriptions of those tools.2. Rather than answering your question in one go, the LLM can say it wants to call a function.3. Your client (developer tool etc) will call that function and pass the results to the LLM.4. The LLM will continue and either complete the conversation or call more tools (functions)5. MCP is gaining traction as a standard way of adding tools/functions to LLMs.GitMCPI haven't looked too deeply but I can guess.1. Will have a bunch of API endpoints that the LLM can call to look at your code. probably stuff like, get_file, get_folder etc.2. When you ask the LLM for example "Tell me how to add observability to the code", the LLM can make calls to get the code and start to look at it.3. The LLM can keep on making calls to GitMCP until it has enough context to answer the question.Hope this helps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We built an open source remote MCP server that can automatically serve documentation from every Github project. 
Simply replace github.com with gitmcp.io in the repo URL - and you get a remote MCP server that serves and searches the documentation from this repo (llms.txt, llms-full.txt, readme.md, etc). Works with github.io as well.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamentally, rules almost always come with compromises — for the sake of making rules understandable by humans, they have to be relatively simple. Simple rules for complex situations will always forbid some amount of good behaviour, and allow some bad behaviour. Many of society's parasites live in the space of "allowable bad behaviour", but there is a lot of value to knowing how to exploit the "forbidden good behaviour" space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the dangerous way I put it that I only tell senior people: understand why rules were made and make sure the people who made them would be happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a supervisor I didn’t resonate with this until I remembered in some jobs I have communicated the company attendance policy but didn’t enforce it unless someone was a poor performer. I trust adults to manage their own time until they give me a reason to believe otherwise.For my part, I’d rather trust people’s judgment and intrinsic motivation than enforce the rules. Enforcement is annoying, tedious, and distracting to my mission. However once I decide their judgement can’t be trusted I use rules to extrinsically motivate them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555220</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Understanding the technical aspects of a servo motor and how it worksI don't feel like the article explains that at all. They explain the control signal and what the servo does as a result. The "how" in between is completely missing though. How is that pulse translated? How does the feedback work? What are the safety mechanisms involved?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's about how radio control toy servos from the 1970s work. Annoyingly, those pre-computer dumb devices with no feedback output still dominate the low end of mechanical output devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve noticed that distributors  (Jameco, Mouser, etc) have a surprising number of introductory education articles. I’ve seen this pattern on websites for car dealerships and HVAC installers, so I assumed it was for SEO purposes. But electronic parts distribution seems like a much more niche audience; why bother with SEO?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43574125</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;Open Nutrition is a platform designed to help users find and explore various nutrition-related resources and data. It offers a searchable database of foods, nutritional information, and dietary guidelines, allowing individuals to make informed choices about their diets. The website aims to promote better nutrition by providing easy access to a wide range of nutritional insights and tools, enabling users to enhance their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

The LLM is tasked with creating complete nutritional values, explicitly explaining the rationale behind each value it generates. Outputs undergo rigorous validation steps, including cross-checking with advanced auditing models such as OpenAI’s o1-pro, which has proven especially proficient at performing high-quality random audits. In practice, o1-pro frequently provided clearer and more substantive insights than manual audits alone.This is not a dataset. This is an insult to the very idea of data. This is the most anti-scientific post I have ever seen voted to the top of HN. Truth about the world is not derived from three LLMs stacked on top of each other in a trenchcoat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; User-generated databases can be unreliable&gt;&gt; Foods discovered via these searches are fed back into the database,Aren’t LLMs also unreliable?

First thought I had after reading that was: must be because people don’t trust AI generated information. Seems disengenuous to minimize the AI aspect in marketing while this product only exists because of AI.Great idea though, thanks for giving it a shot!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The search is broken on safari, every time it refreshes you lose the focus on the text input, which means you have to click on the search bar after every single character you type.

The PNW had quite a robust BBS scene back in the 80s.  Not exactly surprising that tech flourished with such inclement weather.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe obvious to others, but on MacOS I had to `brew install telnet` since it was not installed by default and then `telnet flame.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au 4242`.In the 90's I thought it would make for a wild scene in a (cyberpunk?) story where the protagonist agrees to meet up with a possible informant in a MUD bar. The two apparently idly chatting possibly state secrets while fights between fighters and magic users break out around them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thinking about MUDs always makes me miss the days when GhostMOO was full of players. any others among this crowd? https://mudstats.com/World/Ghostwheel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534480</guid></item><item><title>28.

I think your oneone crate could be split, we would probably be interested to collaborate on an http/2 support. We also have our own internal forgiving parser. It is an interesting thing to build tooling that must intentionally go beyond a spec since you basically have to reimplement all the primitives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the integration of the terminal with vim. I am making a site to learn vim motions called Vimgolf.ai and it’s interesting to see how your vim plugin works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does it need vim and tmux?Couldn't it use vim itself for multiplexing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43568771</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; for an electric guitar, a triangle waveThat is only true when the string is plucked exactly at the middle - not a regular occurrence. Usually it's more of a sawtooth wave, just without the upper harmonics.My experience with distortion in guitars is that a huge component here is how different it can sound depending on articulation. Some pieces for example require the player to not alternate their picking, but pluck only in one direction, as the difference is audible.This is not always the case of course as some amplifiers like those made by Mesa Boogie get their signature tone by exploiting the limited gain-bandwidth product(GBP) of amplifiers, creating an even sound that at the high end of the gain setting is largely without dynamics.In some cases(like the BOSS DS-1) the manufacturer killed the sound by introducing a technically better amplifier chip - the original had somewhat poor GBP and poor settling time, which in combination produced a nice lowpass filter with a resonance peak at the cutoff frequency, which in turn emphasized articulation.It's all a surprisingly huge topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distortion of monophonic tones (single notes/voices) became accepted in the mainstream quite rapidly because the circuits used to produce it quickly improved, informed by feedback (no pun intended) from musicians.Nobody hates ugly sounding distortion more than he or she who practices 5 hours a day with it.Single note distortion, at its best, is a harmonically rich sound which shares something with bowed instruments and reed woodwinds.Nasty sounding single distortion has not gained complete mainstream acceptance. Musicians who do that on purpose will remain niche, even today.  From time to time, such nasty sounds make appearances in mainstream pop, but only as a kind of "cameo". The statement is, "we are inserting this ugly thing here specifically for its idiosyncratic effect, haha! But only a few seconds, we promise".Distortion (other than perhaps mild distortion) has never been fully accepted in roles where the multiple voices of a complex harmony part would be distorted together.Nowhere was that better seen than in jazz/rock fusion, which accepted ragingly distorted guitars for solo work, but not so much for the rest of the music: except, of course, in passages where the guitars provide the "sound of rock": distorted fourths and fifths and whatnot, or double stop bluesy cliches and whatnot.The music best known for distortion and that couldn't exist without distortion (and a lot of it) is of course heavy metal, which is a big landscape of styles and sounds.In metal, the harmonies from an individual guitar part tend to consist of only a few notes. The clean chord is transformed into something else, which perhaps cannot be described in music notation. Complexity comes from the distortion. Distortion includes the sum and difference products, which relate to the tonality and scale of the music in unsual ways. Those notes are not identified. If notation is used at all, the underlying clean notes are notated: e.g. C-F# tritone on the A and D strings, over open E bass. Heavy metal uses syncopated and alternating rhythms to separate bass notes from upper notes in three and four note chords. This is not only to create rhythmical excitement, but to better separate the notes.The notes of a distorted chord are also easier to for the ear to identify if they are introduced separately as a lasciare suonare arpeggio; that's a thing in metal.Harmonic textures are also created by combining distorted guitar parts. Using two lead guitars originated in rock, with groups like Wishbone Ash. Multitrack recording allows an unlimited number of parts to be layered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos to the author for writing an academic thesis on distortion in music, but it sure reads like an academic thesis rather than a statement about art.In contrast, I thoroughly enjoyed and resonated with this short conversation between Henry Rollins (Black Flag) and Don Was (President of the Jazz label Blue Note) about distortion in music:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p6_WCqaucc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43575379</guid></item><item><title>30.

Like present the players with a bot who's purpose is to be un-hitt-able unless the player is cheating.  I don't know, there has to be a way.  Cheaters are disease in online gaming. I know that sensible people won't want to sacrifice their anonymity to provide ID to play a video game but if it is in the competitive scene and they are playing for money, surely it isn't a stretch to ask for ID and thus ultimate accountability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$5-500 monthly payments just to bypass a decent anti-cheat...Cheaters must reflash their BIOS, wipe their PCs, reinstall Windows, and create a new account to play again...every few weeksThis is fun? If it's eSports for $$ I understand the incentive, otherwise pretending to be good, all the while likely having not a twinge of irony hit you as you 'git gud the opposition...

I've been a DevOps/Platform engineer for ~10 years and was a Mac/iOS app developer before that. My background is broad and strange, I'm less of a t-shaped person than a comb-shaped guy with a bunch of weird deep spikes and more than a few weird gaps.I want to move into machine learning and AI, ideally HPC and/or scientific/research computing. My plan is to move into MLOps, then move from there into HPC, and my longterm goal (5-10 years) is to move into deep tech research and possibly get my PhD in CS or math (somewhere in the area of topology/manifolds if the latter).I recently had a come-to-$DEITY moment and I'm taking a week off work to do a deep-dive on Slurm and as many other topics as I can cram into each day. I'm new in this space and I have a lot to learn, but I'm really ambitious and looking for a place that won't slow me down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43547609</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Steam Deck, a handheld gaming device by Valve, highlighting its capabilities, performance, and user experience. It emphasizes the device's compatibility with a vast library of PC games, its powerful hardware specifications, and the ease of use for both casual and hardcore gamers. The review also navigates through its design, battery life, and the importance of software support, ultimately positioning the Steam Deck as a significant contender in the portable gaming market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No company is your friend. But Valve does a great job at being consumer friendly. Steam is a great low-pressure sales environment. It provides features that make it more enjoyable for users to play, hang out, communicate, share content, mods. It doesn't harangue you or change your settings, or the UI, or your games (mostly) without reason and warning. Things work like you expect them to in other apps, back buttons work. You can pop open multiple windows. It gets out of your way. You can even set your kids accounts to not have access to the store, something that literally no other company does. I'd love to disable the Minecraft Marketplace for my kids because sometimes they spend more time looking at things there than playing.GabeN called piracy a service problem. And he's right. I've received games free on other platforms like Epic or EA and I've bought them from Steam just so I don't have to use the terrible apps. If I was younger or couldn't afford it, maybe I'd be sailing the seas. I bought Alan Wake 2 on Epic since it's a timed exclusive. I plan on buying it again once it releases on Steam because Epic is just so terrible. All the effort went into the store and almost none into the actual act of playing the game which is where I'm spending the majority of my time while I'm in the app!Most companies don't care about customer satisfaction or post sales support. They have your money, why would they. Oh, yeah, repeat customers.EDIT: Just to add a gripe about Amazon. Their games app is so bad that if you use the back button on your mouse while a screenshot is open the page changes but the image stays until you close it. If you click on a game to view the details in a long list of games and then go back it loses your sort order and position in the games listing. It's frustrating to use even just to find something to play. Steam has its own rough edges, but they're not in the golden path of discover -&gt; buy -&gt; install -&gt; play -&gt; share&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It truly is, and it's the culmination of a long history of development to get to this point. Back in, I want to say 2016 or so, we had Steam Machines, which were a series of hardware partnerships with various vendors for a console-style form factor of essentially PC hardware running on the first version of Steam OS.It was an incredible idea, but at the time rather frustratingly, I think some people came down with what I like to call The Verge Syndrome, which is to judge things on whether or not they're an overnight success, and otherwise deemed failures. So, according to some people, the fact that there were fewer Steam Machines than PlayStations in the world meant that the project as a whole was a failure.And so the Steam Machine was not successful (by that metric at least), but it got the ball rolling on increasing sophistication in developing the Linux ecosystem and the understanding of hardware that culminated in the Steam Deck, which is a triumphant rebalancing of the PC gaming universe, away from dependence on Windows. But try telling that to someone in 2016.I'm happy to sing the praises of Valve, but I think a particular distinguishing virtue they're holding on to is being willing to play the long game and not giving up in the absence of overnight success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I purchased a steam deck when they first came out specifically to financially support Valve's Linux efforts and I haven't regretted that purchase for a second. In the past year I had a couple of days where my laptop was not working. I got out my steam deck, plugged it into my dock, and got back to work like nothing happened (after installing some software of course, like emacs). I've re-purchased games that I own on consoles just to get the PC versions to de-couple my games from hardware, so now I'll be able to run Flower on powerful beasts, portable handhelds, and computers that haven't been invented yet whereas before it was stuck on a loud aging ps3.My only complaint is console exclusives like the nintendo games. I don't want to have to purchase Nintendo's universal turing machine just to be able to run their software when I already have a perfectly capable universal turing machine. It would just lead to more e-waste and wasted closet space.Sure I can pirate and emulate the games, but I am an employed adult, I want to give you money for your games. Release your games on Steam so I can do that without burdening the world with more e-waste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43567923</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and size of VMS (Virtual Memory System), a prominent operating system initially developed for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the 1970s. It highlights VMS's robust architecture, which supports a wide range of applications and is known for its reliability and scalability. The piece also touches on its ongoing relevance in modern computing environments, particularly in enterprise applications, and examines the evolving ecosystem around VMS, including its compatibility with contemporary technologies and its community support.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any reason to use VMS today other than for existing applications that cannot be migrated? I've heard its reliability is legendary, but I've never tried it myself. The 1 year licensed VM seems excessively annoying. Is it just old and esoteric, or does it still have practical use? At least with Linux, multiple vendors release and support distros and it is mainstream, whereas with VMS, you'd be stuck with VSI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Cutler is one of my heroes. I think he only worked on the first version of VMS, but his expertise of OS design and implementation is probably second to few.Does anyone know whether he is still working in Microsoft? What does it feel to work with him?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a morbid curiosity about this system, but I don't really have a charitable view of it.The story as far as I know, goes like thisBack in the late 1970s Dave Cutler and his team create VMS at DEC as the next generation operating system for DEC's new flagship product, the VAX minicomputer.VMS is good by all accounts and was a successful product, but Unix goes on to dominate the minicomputer and emerging server market for the next decade.Then in the 1990s DEC goes out of business and sells VMS to Compaq, but not before porting it to their doomed Alpha CPU architecture.Then in 2000s Compaq goes out of business and gets acquired by HP, and together they port VMS to the doomed Itanium CPU architecture.In 2014, a shop called VMS Software Inc (VSI) strikes some kind of deal with HP where they get to develop and support new versions of VMS while older versions continue to belong to HP. As part of this, they finally announce an x86-64 port. This port first sees the light of day in 2020.----The story is essentially bad bet after bad bet, missing the boat and fighting the last war over and over again. And today, it's just a piece of legacy software being used to extract the last bits of value from the organizations that are stuck with it.Even so, I hope for a true open source release of it one day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573738</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I just can't understand is proactively using the :: syntax. It's sooo ugly with so much unnecessary line noise. Just use a single period! I think one of the best decisions D made was to get of -&gt; and :: and just use . for everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it allow you to make functions weak? Can you do something like gcc's constructor attribute?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently gave this language a spin with raylib and libtmx for loading tiled maps. Out of C3, Zig, and Odin, I've had the least trouble integrating C libraries with C3 (rolled my own bindings for libtmx). Overall a big fan of the language and am hoping it gets recognition on the level of the other languages mentioned here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43569724</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the intriguing possibility that magician Harry Houdini may have engaged in espionage during his lifetime, particularly in relation to his connections with government officials and involvement in World War I. It highlights Houdini's participation in intelligence efforts, including his efforts to uncover information about German spies and his collaboration with various law enforcement agencies. The piece delves into Houdini's fascination with the supernatural and how it intersected with national security, ultimately questioning whether his escapology acts were merely entertainment or part of a larger spy narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I understand this correctly, the `BroadcastChannel` API solves a similar purpose.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_C...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The subscribe() implementation seems suboptimal in the case where there are many different topics:    subscribe(topic, callback) {
        if (this.listeners[topic] == undefined) {
            // Not yet any listener for this topic
            this.listeners[topic] = [];

            window.addEventListener('storage', (e) =&gt; {
                const dataKey = topic + "_data";
                if (e.key === dataKey) {
                    const data =  JSON.parse(e.newValue)[0];
                    this.listeners[topic].forEach((v, k) =&gt; {
                        v(data);
                    });
                }
            }, false);
        }
        this.listeners[topic].push(callback)
    }

This installs a handler for every single topic, and every time a message is published, the handlers for all topics are called, even though at most one is interested in the change. A more efficient implementation would install a single handler, e.g. (untested):    window.addEventListener('storage', (e) =&gt; {
        if (e.key.endsWith('_data')) {
            const topic = e.key.substring(0, e.key.length - 5);
            const data = JSON.parse(e.newValue)[0];
            this.listeners[topic]?.forEach(v =&gt; v(data));
       }
    }, false);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built a ComfyUi node that let you run a little paint program in another tab. (Sorry about the lack of updates if you use it. I intend to get back to it)Negotiating the communication between tabs was by far the hardest part.  In the end I ended up using local storage for signaling to establish a dedicated messsageport channel.It was such a fight to make something that re-established the connection when either page reloaded.There are still some connection issues that I haven't been able to resolve.  It seems some browsers on some systems reject messages between tabs if they were loaded hours apart.It might be worth benchmarking a pure local storage fallback, but I'm guessing it would suffer with high traffic.A generalised implementation that allowed switching multiple paint programs and multiple ComfyUi pages would be ideal.  A PubSub might be the way to go.There's also the issue of other parts of the app also using local storage. Need to not step on toes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43569961</guid></item><item><title>40.

Even if the goal wasn't reached (getting the AlphaStation to boot), having something to show for a negative result still helps if someone else needs to go down a similar road - or, for that matter, needs to know not to go down a particular road.I likewise wrote a COVID-boredom-induced blog post about my many missteps, and eventual failure, getting AIX to run on an old PC. My "learnings" there were that the installation media (floppies) are _written to_ by the installer, making a reset to a known state rather difficult, and also that support for IDE disks was only made available in a patch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sounds like a case of "it's always the PSU" in figurative sense... e.g. half-blown fuses, dried up caps, good +12V but weakened 3V3 lines, oxidation on sockets, things of that nature.Or it could be platform quirks, or more interesting failures like crystal oscillator degrading, but I'd leave those to later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531695</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm interested in this as a faster intervention than QE. $10 given to a low income family will likely be spent that week. $10 of QE will just sit on somebodies balance sheet.Understanding BI as a tool of monetary policy seems to remove the ideologically charged view we see when it is considered as part of the welfare state&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish people would learn to keep emotion out of this topic. There is really one ultimate question here: "Is this the best use of our tax dollars?". Not: "Does this feel like the best use of our tax dollars?".Show me how much UBI saves police departments, social welfare services, the health-care system,etc.. and how many new tax paying consumers it produces. Is it a reliable investment on people or is it a poor gamble? I've been hearing about this since before the 2016 election, there should be ample data on this, instead of speculation. And I have no problem with cities/states re-attempting and retrying new approaches to UBI.That said, are there any studies or experiments out there where instead of a blind UBI, people are put in a labor pool of some sort where they get guaranteed income but if they're able-bodied they must make themselves available to perform jobs for the state or clients of the state? I'm thinking this should be the alternative to things like prison labor. Again, take the emotion and speculation out of it, what do we have left?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If people are paying a significant portion of their salaries, one-third or even half, towards rent, does it truly make sense to implement UBI? In my opinion, the answer is no. Instead, we should focus on establishing a Universal Basic Land: https://mertbulan.com/2025/03/02/we-need-universal-basic-lan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564644</guid></item><item><title>44. The reality of working in tech: We're not hired to write code (2023)</title><link>https://idiallo.com/blog/code-for-hire</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article on idiallo.com discusses the concept of "Code for Hire," which points to the growing trend of hiring freelance developers to complete coding projects. It highlights the advantages of this approach, such as access to specialized skills, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility in project management. The piece also addresses potential challenges, including communication issues and the need for clear project specifications, and suggests best practices for businesses to effectively collaborate with freelance programmers. Ultimately, it serves as a guide for companies considering outsourcing coding tasks to freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a coworker who _excels_ at writing code - one of those engineers who can metabolize caffeine directly into code.They write code to implement the all-important features. They write code to work around lack of process. They write code to work around problem people not doing their jobs well. They write code to work around buggy code by other developers. They write code to work around their own code, written weeks or months earlier.I've been encouraging them to _reduce_ the amount of code they write, and instead consider the context around why they're writing the code. Code is just one way - and not always a particularly good way - that we can solve people and process problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if the fact that we're not hired to write code, is also the reason we're not paid as much as some other roles. This is my big frustration: that senior programmers (in NL at least) are not paid as much as managers, POs, various kinds of architects, and even scrum masters.A couple of years ago, I was freelancing for a company where I wrote a lot of excellent code. They had a bunch of data they wanted to do something with, but weren't entirely sure what or how, so I did that for them. Connected, visualized it, made it fast, and they loved it. And so did I. It was fun work, I talked to a lot of people about what they wanted and needed, and delivered that.My freelance period ended, but I wasn't ready to leave this project yet, so I became an employee, but that turned out to be a massive step back in terms of income. Despite the fact that I worked closely with lots of stakeholders and solved complex problems for them, their internal rules didn't allow them to pay me as more than a code monkey. I felt all the non-code work I did wasn't being appreciated. Nor the code work.I left, they ruined the application (it's apparently slow as molasses now), and now I'm about to go back. I guess I've made peace with the fact that they don't pay programmers as much as I think they should. (It's not actually bad pay, just not as much as non-programmers get.) But mostly, it was a fun project that taught me a lot, and I want more of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In most companies, writing code is the last thing developers (should) do. You're there to achieve business objectives, and you were hired because someone thought your experience and skillset will be necessary to achieve those business objectives. Sometimes those objectives are met with an excel sheet, sometimes they're met by losely integrating various 3rd parties, sometimes they're met by integrating various libraries, and sometimes it requires treading new ground and writing some real code.The best web dev isn't the one that knows .Net, React, Svelte, GraphQL, micro-frontends, etc. The best web dev is the one that can convince their manager that their business objectives can be achieved by using WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563533</guid></item><item><title>45.

How is user data managed, any plans for e2ee?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TL;DR: programs today are effing boring. Need more cyberpunk in my lifeAfter spending all my money on creating a community platform no-one wanted, in a style that I thought would fit most people (but didn't particularly enjoy myself, too vanilla), I got tired and decided to create something I've wanted in my daily life since I read Neuromancer the first time 20yrs ago.This is what I'm working on. It's early, like really early, but it's a f*cking JOY to work on and use already! Right now I'm trying to move my friends over from Discord to this, but if there is interest in a voice/text chat app for a broader mass of ppl, I'd love to make a real product out of it and do this for a living!What ya think?
Sushi-style feedback welcome (raw and fresh).Cheers,

People are quick to judge the looks or three-wheelness of the car, but I think that's just a symptom of cars being marketed as status symbols nowadays.I am worried about production. With all of the years it's taking them to get there, they can run out of money at any time it seems. It's unknown if they can raise enough money on their terms to get this thing to production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love these things. Sadly, it’s like an Elven artifact: a beautiful elegant thing, built for people who just aren’t quite like us. Us (the mass market, 99% of car buyers) are orcs. We look at a thing like this and can’t see the beauty or utility of being efficient and having a light footprint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's new here?

Edit: GW-BASIC, not QBASIC (https://github.com/microsoft/GW-BASIC)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Jobs used to say the problem with Microsoft is they don’t have taste.The font-shimmering effect on scroll immediately reminded me of that, it is really distracting.

That was easy - the 8080 can be done quite simply with a 256 value switch - I did mine in FORTRAN77.Writing a BASIC interpreter, with floating point, is much harder.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, the use of novel antibiotics must be strictly prohibited in the animal food industry.This is crucial because the misuse of antibiotics in livestock farming has been a major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global health crisis. When antibiotics are overused or improperly applied in animals, bacteria can evolve to become resistant, rendering these life-saving drugs ineffective for treating infections in humans and animals alike.It has always been a perversity that life-saving reserve antibiotics were ever permitted to prop up the grotesque machinery of the modern food industry—a system built on global-scale animal cruelty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the 1960s a Canadian research expedition collected soil samples from Easter Island which led to the discovery of rapamycin (aka sirolimus).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimushttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9634974/(Full disclosure - spent my PhD working with macrolides including this one.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did the whole thing, was able to get the Fibonacci numbers appear and learned a lot during the process. However, I would not recommend other people to try this today, because --* It is not necessarily the best way to spend your time and money. You'll be looking at tens of hours on building it plus over $300 in parts, for a very slow and basic computer that you probably will forget and throw away at some point. Cutting and laying out wires are some of the most tedious and frustrating process. There are other cheaper, more efficient ways to learn how a computer works. It may or may not be worth the effort to you.* The tutorial is really old, with some very questionable design choices and no updates from the author. Some of the designs are just plain wrong -- e.g. floating inputs or missing resistors. It is very unlikely you can reproduce it by strictly following the tutorial. You'll need to spend time debugging those issues and go to reddit to see other people's experience with this, potentially seeking help as well. No doubt debugging is an important part of designing and understanding the circuit. But only if you have the foundational knowledge and patience, of which I happened to have, but I can imagine that someone who does not understand digital electronics well enough can easily get lost and feel defeated.* To make the previous point worse, some of the parts are hard to source, depending on where you are. (You'll likely fry or physically break a few components when building it.) Many of the parts are not very commonly used these days, and not exactly easy to acquire, if you only need 1 or 2 of them. I had to go to eBay to get some of them, which took about a week, during which I had to stop and wait for parts to arrive.With all that said, this may still be the best resource out there that lets you build all these on a breadboard, as I am not aware of an alternative that addresses all the issues above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always upvote Ben Eater's project(s).I got his 6502 kit and worked through his YouTube videos to get it up and running with LCD display and all. I want to actually frame it and get it running, hanging on a wall.If anyone is new to Ben, find a comfortable chair or couch, make some tea, take a breath, and begin your descent into his long-form breadboard series of nerd-splaining how a CPU works, beginning with basic logic gates.His follow-on series is a little higher level. He's still at it with the breadboards but he allows that this time the CPU (a 6502) is already built for us. He then walks through how the address bus works, how to attach RAM, etc.It makes me wish I could be transported back to the 70's when things could still be understood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Ben Eater computer is an interesting starting point. With a few modifications, such as an extended program counter / address bus, a combinatorial ALU programmed in flash, and a few more registers, it can be upgraded to a more powerful, if slow, computer.Further, these circuits can be directly simulated in an FPGA if you want to teach yourself an HDL like VHDL or Verilog. You really want to learn better and faster ways to organize a CPU, but it's a fun way for a beginner to bridge into this kind of work.At the local hackerspace, we actually taught a class that assembled a hybrid 8-bit / 16-bit variation of this computer with 1MB of RAM, an 8-bit ALU, a 16-bit data bus / registers, and a 20-bit address bus. With this additional capability, we could program it over serial with a very basic bootloader, and it was powerful enough to compute pi to 1000 digits. Granted, this took about 18 hours, but it could have run faster with a printed circuit board and a crystal oscillator. We just never really got to that point.As for how powerful such a computer with discrete logic can be, consider that the KB-11A CPU for the PDP-11/45 was built using 74-series logic ICs. It wasn't until after this system that DEC moved on to VSLI. So, this is a way to play with technology found in computers in 1972 / 1973.As a stepping stone to digital logic and FPGA work, Ben Eater's tutorial isn't bad. Just get yourself a copy of Don Lancaster's TTL Cookbook or CMOS Cookbook to bring his tutorial up to best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533715</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the diminishing quality of critical thinking in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) due to the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence. It highlights how AI tools, while enhancing efficiency in data analysis and information gathering, may inadvertently reduce the necessity for human judgment and analytical reasoning. The piece warns that this dependency could lead to a superficial understanding of intelligence tasks, urging the OSINT community to maintain a balance between utilizing AI and fostering critical thinking skills in order to ensure comprehensive and well-reasoned intelligence assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Participants weren’t lazy. They were experienced professionals.Assuming these professionals were great critical thinkers until the AI came along and changed that is a big stretch.In my experience, the people who outsource their thinking to LLMs are the same people who outsourced their thinking to podcasts, news articles, Reddit posts, Twitter rants, TikTok videos, and other such sources. LLMs just came along and offered them opinions on demand that they could confidently repeat.&gt; The scary part is that many users still believed they were thinking critically, because GenAI made them feel smartI don’t see much difference between this and someone who devours TikTok videos on a subject until they feel like an expert. Same pattern, different sources. The people who outsource their thinking and collect opinions they want to hear just have an easier way to skip straight to the conclusions they want now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big problem in open source intelligence is not in-depth analysis. It's finding something worth looking at in a flood of info.Here's the CIA's perspective on this subject.[1] The US intelligence community has a generative AI system to help analyze open source intelligence. It's called OSIRIS.[2]
There are some other articles about it. The previous head of the CIA said the main use so far is summarization.The original OSINT operation in the US was the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service from WWII. All through the Cold War, someone had to listen to Radio Albania just in case somebody said something important. The CIA ran that for decades. Its descendant is the current open source intelligence organization. Before the World Wide Web, they used to publish some of the summaries on paper, but as people got more serious about copyright, that stopped.DoD used to publish The Early Bird, a daily newsletter for people in DoD. It was just reprints of articles from newspapers, chosen for stories senior leaders in DoD would need to know about. It wasn't supposed to be distributed outside DoD for copyright reasons, but it wasn't hard to get.[1] https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/d6fd3fa9ce19f1abf2b...[2] https://apnews.com/article/us-intelligence-services-ai-model...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"""•  Instead of forming hypotheses, users asked the AI for ideas.•  Instead of validating sources, they assumed the AI had already done so.•  Instead of assessing multiple perspectives, they integrated and edited the AI’s summary and moved on.This isn’t hypothetical. This is happening now, in real-world workflows."""Amen, and OSINT is hardly unique in this respect.And implicitly related, philosophically:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43561654&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573465</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe others will relate? I'm not a headphone person but always have music playing in the background on speakers — often at a fairly low volume so it is easily ignored, talked over.I find without the presence of external music I will have a song playing in my head instead. And generally the same song for hours (!). So I suppose the external click-track freezes up my mind somehow.In case anyone cares, my "playlist" is local music I've purchased over the decades — maybe 4 or 5 days long? In my "lab" (man-cave, I suppose) I have a shorter, streamed playlist on the stereo that is looping over new music that I am currently "auditioning". The songs that make the cut are purchased and added eventually to the local playlist that plays elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study finds you enjoy doing things you like. If there's something you particularly like, you seem to enjoy it even more.If you are missing on some form of pleasure in your life, substituting it for another pleasure can help alleviate the pain.Woah.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the cases I call reality mismatch:Through evolution we have been programmed to associate music with security of the group being nearby. Now we can listen to music even though the group is very distant in time and space. Maybe it's not a complete reality mismatch because in a sense we are still close to the group through the Internet.However the positive feelings are over exaggerated given the limited modern benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43540626</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has introduced native Python support for CUDA, enabling developers to write CUDA code directly in Python without needing to resort to C or C++ bindings. This enhancement aims to streamline the development process for data scientists and researchers who prefer using Python for their projects. The article discusses the implications of this integration, highlighting how it will simplify GPU programming and expand accessibility for those who may not be familiar with more complex programming languages. With this update, NVIDIA is positioning itself to better cater to the growing demand for machine learning and data processing capabilities in Python-centric workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

I pulled together a quick demo of using the GPU vs the CPU, based on what I could find (https://gist.github.com/victorb/452a55dbcf59b3cbf84efd8c3097...) which gave these results (after downloading 2.6GB of dependencies of course):    Creating 100 random matrices of size 5000x5000 on CPU...

Definitely worth digging into more, as the API is really simple to use, at least for basic things like these. CUDA programming seems like a big chore without something higher level like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thank God, Pytorch gained so much momentum before this came out, Now we have a true platform independent semi standard For parallel computations. We are not stuck with NVIDIA specifics.It's great that parts of pie torch which concern the NVIDIA backend can now be implemented in Python directly, The important part that it doesn't really matter or shouldn't matter for end users / Developersthat being said, maybe this new platform will extend the whole concept of on GPU computation via Python to even more domains like maybe games.Imagine running rust the Game performantly mainly on the GPU  via Python&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CuTile, in many ways, feels like a successor to OpenAI's Triton... And not only are we getting tile/block-level primitives and TileIR, but also a proper SIMT programming model in CuPy, which I don't think enough people noticed even at this year's GTC. Very cool stuff!That said, there were almost no announcements or talks related to CPUs, despite the Grace CPUs being announced quite some time ago. It doesn't feel like we're going to see generalizable abstractions that work seamlessly across Nvidia CPUs and GPUs anytime soon. For someone working on parallel algorithms daily, this is an issue: debugging with NSight and CUDA-GDB still isn't the same as raw GDB, and it's much easier to design algorithms on CPUs first and then port them to GPUs.Of all the teams in the compiler space, Modular seems to be among the few that aren't entirely consumed by the LLM craze, actively building abstractions and languages spanning multiple platforms. Given the landscape, that's increasingly valuable. I'd love to see more people experimenting with Mojo — perhaps it can finally bridge the CPU-GPU gap that many of us face daily!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581584</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;Hatchet is an open-source Python library designed for analyzing and visualizing the performance of parallel applications, particularly those that utilize High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. It focuses on simplifying the process of examining profiling data from applications, providing users with tools to process, filter, and visualize such data. The library supports various formats and integrates with existing tools to enhance the analysis of performance bottlenecks and improve efficiency in computational workloads. The GitHub repository provides access to the source code, documentation, and user guides to facilitate its usage and community contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on the forum focuses on the Erlang programming language, particularly around a thread discussing its performance, features, and potential use cases. Participants share insights regarding Erlang's concurrency model, fault tolerance, and its applications in distributed systems. The conversation illustrates the community's experiences and opinions on how Erlang can be utilized effectively in various programming scenarios, emphasizing its strengths and challenges in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

For a while he had this idea of a git + bittorrent he called it gittorrent, only to find out someone had already used the name. I think it was a bit of an extension of this universal functions idea.If you expand some of the comments below, he and other members of the community at the time have a nice discussion about hierarchical namespace.I particularly like his "flat beer and chips" comment:https://groups.google.com/g/erlang-programming/c/LKLesmrss2k---&gt; I'd like to know if there will be hierarchial modules in Erlang,
because tree of packages is a rather good idea:No it's not - this has been the subject of long and heated discussion and is
why packages are NOT in Erlang - many people - myself included - dislike
the idea of hierarchical namespaces. The dot in the name has no semantics
it's just a separator. The name could equally well be encoders.mpg.erlyvideo
or mpg.applications.erlvideo.encoder - there is no logical way to organise the
package name and it does not scale -erlyvideo.mpegts.encoder
erlyvideo.rtp.encoderBut plain module namespace is also ok. It would be impossible for me
to work with 30K LOC with plain function namespace.The English language has a flat namespace.I'd like a drink.alcoholic.beer with my food.unhealthy.hamburger and my food.unhealthy.national.french.friesI have no problem with flat beer and chips./Joe---&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need modules so that my search results aren't cluttered with contamination from code that is optimised to be found rather than designed to solve my specific problem.We need then so that we can find all functions that are core to a given purpose, and have been written with consideration of their performance and a unified purpose rather than also finding a grab bag of everybody's crappy utilities that weren't designed to scale for my use case.We need them so that people don't have to have 80 character long function names prefixed with Hungarian notation for every distinct domain that shares the same words with different meanings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those things where I don’t agree with the argument, but know the person making it knows way more than I do on the subject and has given it way more thought.  In these cases it’s usually best to sit back and listen a bit...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43554444</guid></item><item><title>10.

The whalers were processing their catch at sea even in the 1800s. Probably not as efficiently, but still they were not dragging their catch back to land for processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Soviet union had an outsized role in this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_the_Soviet_Union_an...To meet lucrative production quotas, the Soviet Union lied to international agencies about how many whales they were catching.

(we had a compiler) however we really didn't understand the advantages of being born in the right place .....I really wish we'd incorporated, we could have sold the name for some silly amount of money&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's also almost 50 years since "An Open Letter to Hobbyists"[1]. It's amazing that in the last 30+ years, the "hobbyists" managed to turn the entire software industry by 180°, and that Microsoft themselves are reliant on that work.Bill even specifically mentions musicians. By 1976, when blues was only ca 100 years old, most bands would play what we now call "covers", credit each original writer on the back of the record, and there was no shame or stigma around it. Art builds on art, and "stealing" is probably the most important part of the process[2].[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists[2]: https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the majority of revenue of Microsoft is not Windows anymore, I think Windows defines the brand much like how iPhone and Mac define Apple even though that might be part of the revenue not all of it.What I am curious about is what happens when the original product that makes the company popular starts to experience poor quality. Take Google for example, its search has been on a decline in the last decade or so and needless to say the company is experiencing problems as well in the last few years. While GCP and GSuite are significant, people have lost faith in Google which probably started with search.Windows 11 and the iPhone seem to be heading towards same fate as Google search imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43539595</guid></item><item><title>12.

To this day I haven't found a teacher who could express complex ideas as clearly and concisely as Starmer does. It's written in an almost children's book like format that is very easy to read and understand. He also just published a book on NN that is just as good. Highly recommend even if you are already an expert as it will give you great ways to teach and communicate complex ideas in ML.[0]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75622146-the-statquest-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest challenge with ML models isn't the algorithm but the organization of contextual knowledge. In my experience, hierarchical structuring of documentation significantly improves results, especially when working with LLMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my other comment elsewhere. These resources helped me understand the topics better.If anyone wants to understand fundamentals of machine learning, one of the superb resources I have found is, Stanford's "Probability for computer scientists"[1].It goes into theoretical underpinnings of probability theory and ML, IMO better than any other course I have seen. But, this is a primarily a probability course that discusses the fundamentals of machine learning. (Yeah, Andrew Ng is legendary, but his course demands some mathematical familiarity with linear algebra topics)There is a course reader for CS109 [2]. You can download pdf version of this.
Caltech's learning from data was really good too, if someone is looking for theoretical understanding of ML topics [3].There is also book for excellent caltech course[4].Also, neural networks zero to hero is for understanding how neural networks are built from ground up [5].[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MuDZIAzBMY&amp;list=PLoROMvodv4...[2] https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientist...[3] https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse[4] https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Data-Yaser-S-Abu-Mostafa/dp/...[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&amp;list=PLAqhIrjkxb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586073</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the 8pinLinux project, which is an optimized Linux distribution designed for development on the 8pin RISC microcontroller. It highlights key features such as support for real-time applications, a lightweight environment, and a modular design that enables efficient resource management. The project aims to provide developers with a streamlined platform for building applications tailored to the capabilities of the 8pin architecture, facilitating easier development and deployment processes. Additionally, it includes documentation and resources for users to get started with the development tools available in the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So, which pins could be combined with SDIO's three? After much thinking, the solution is obvious. RAM's nCS can be the SD card's CLK. RAM's CLK can be the SD card's CMD. RAM's MOSI can be the SD card's DAT. Try and figure out all the possible interactions with each device and what that would look like to the other, to convince yourself that it will work safely.This is truly a brilliant hack, well worth publishing at Hacker News.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always a bit saddened to see that a separate chip is the go-to method to interface with USB. Unfortunately USB is an incredibly-complex protocol that it seems anything beyond a basic V-USB running USB 1.1 at low-speed is generally not doable without specialized hardware and a significant software stack.  Meanwhile a protocol like SPI is ridiculously simple...the minimum hardware needed is a shift register that can be clocked fast enough. I miss how desktop and labtops used to have an exposed serial and parallel port, which could communicate at this low level. I often wonder if instead of USB existing that we instead stuck with UART, I2C, or SPI multidrop (using a small set of standard clock rates) for simple peripherals (maybe over a single connector like the 4-pin JST SH cable for Stemma QT, Qwiic and Grove) over a short distance, and then jumped to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet links for data-heavy peripherals like monitors and external drives. Then instead of having to have separate support for USB and Ethernet, you just would support Ethernet links.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent article, thanks. At the risk of missing the forest for the trees, I wonder how much simpler things would have been if you had been slightly flexible on the 8-pin requirement. It seems as though having just a few more pins would have reduced the complexity of the project significantly while only marginally increasing the time it takes to solder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586654</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Airbnb measures the lifetime value (LTV) of its listings to enhance business strategies and improve profitability. It explains the methodology used to calculate LTV, which involves assessing the revenue generated from a listing over its active lifetime, accounting for various factors such as user engagement, market trends, and customer acquisition costs. The piece emphasizes the importance of data analysis in optimizing listings and driving growth, while also highlighting challenges in making accurate predictions and the need for continuous refinement of measurement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this is missing a really important factor: how likely are guests to use airbnb again after staying at a listing?A listing could look great online and receive a lot of bookings (so high LTV), but ultimately drive users away from the platform.A certain ad platform I worked on cared a lot about this - offensive ads could get you to quit the site altogether. You might want to count every ad as positive for the company since you make money, but some might actually be negative expected value! As a side note, I think this is a really undermeasured problem. There are many sites I won't use because the ads are so overwhelming or are often offensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airbnb’s original promise was magical, thrilling, interesting - get to stay in unusual places that are full of charm and possibility.But that promise was broken for me when Commaleta played back the video of her front door camera and counted that we had 10 people walk in her door, not eight. She proceeded to accuse us of throwing a party, when we absolutely did not, and tried to charge us $1000 extra dollars.At that point, I decided that Airbnb’s hosts were too much of a wildcard in most travel situations.By the way, the story above is from 10 years ago and I will never forget her name for the rest of my life…she turned what should’ve been a relaxing, beautiful week into a miserable arbitration process. It’s hard for ABNB to succeed long term when one experience like that can ruin everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man I'm so sick of trying to find something on Airbnb only to discover by the time I order that the price has doubled.Airbnb these last years went from feeling fresh and adventurous to scammy and dubious&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43545674</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of a transputer emulator, detailing its purpose, features, and usage. It aims to replicate the functionality of Transputer systems, which were known for their parallel processing capabilities in computing. The site includes information on the emulator's design, programming examples, and offers resources for users to learn and experiment with Transputer programming. It highlights the emulator's potential for educational purposes and understanding parallel computing concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's incredible to see such an amount of Transputer work without seemingly mentioning either Occam or the microcode instructions regarding channels. The fact the Transputer was intended to be a high performance design is so often lost, and the development of the floating point units proved one of the more successful bits of the entire enterprise.The impressive part here isn't so much the emulator, but all the rest. A pascal compiler for the Transputer as a teenager in early 90s Mexico? That's brilliantly unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ooh I love this.Seeing a DOS transpiled into JavaScript is pretty cool. Seeing a DOS written in the 90s by a Spanish speaking native who wanted everything written in Spanish is AWESOME. Being told write AYUDA is great. I love the sense of ownership it implies the author had as a teen.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "local-first" web development, emphasizing the importance of building applications that prioritize local storage and offline functionality. It highlights how this approach enhances user experience by ensuring smooth accessibility, data security, and resilience in scenarios with limited or no internet connectivity. The author advocates for leveraging modern web technologies to create rich, responsive applications that store data locally while still being capable of syncing with remote servers when available, thus fostering a more user-centric and robust web experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive overview of Byzantine art and architecture, detailing its historical context, key characteristics, and major developments from the early Christian period through the fall of Constantinople. It explores various artistic forms, including mosaics, frescoes, and iconography, highlighting the influence of religion and politics on artistic expression.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I have to do the "click on the motorcycle/traffic lights" captcha more than once I will instead click the back button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, let me see what I think I understand here:1. AI models are good at Cæsar-cypher transposition, because it occurs often enough in training models for certain values of the cypher offset.  Outside those values, AI doesn't handle the transformations well.2. Somehow AI models perform this cypher also within high ranges of Unicode, because the characters are encoded as three tokens each, of which the last one encodes the same difference as between alphabetic letters, and so the first two tokens get discarded as irrelevant, meaning that by sheer chance the alphabet maps perfectly via Cæsar-cypher (with a two-token offset) to a specific range of Unicode characters reserved for Byzantine music notation.3. This is easy to understand for one AI model, because its explicable by chance that the offset between the alphabet and Byzantine music notation should coincide perfectly with two less-significant tokens.  It's harder to understand why this works in more than one AI model, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another thing that LLMs are (surprisingly?) good at is randomly mixed language conversations, here's something I tried a few days ago:Prompt: Kan du comprender questo text?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite Tcl story is a little side note about how Tcl could have been the language of the web[1]  the founding of Netscape   occurred at the same time I was deciding where to go in industry when I left Berkeley in 1994. Jim Clarke and Marc Andreessen approached me about the possibility of my joining Netscape as a founder, but I eventually decided against it (they hadn't yet decided to do Web stuff when I talked with them). This is one of the biggest "what if" moments of my career. If I had gone to Netscape, I think there's a good chance that Tcl would have become the browser language instead of JavaScript and the world would be a different place! However, in retrospect I'm not sure that Tcl would actually be a better language for the Web than JavaScript, so maybe the right thing happened.


Too humble Dr. Ousterhout!  It would have been a far better language.1 - https://pldb.io/blog/JohnOusterhout.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny that Tcl was mentioned today. I've recently been hacking on jimtcl[1] (a small footprint implementation of Tcl) to make objects multi-threaded safe, as that's the core language that folk.computer[2] uses (the main authors are making the interpreter and reactive DB parallelizable rn, so I've been tinkering with how to reduce copying).[1] https://github.com/msteveb/jimtcl

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The best minds of my generationI’m tired of that line. I remember first seeing it on “the best minds of our generation being employed to sell you ads”. Making a computer go brrr doesn’t qualify anyone for a “best mind”.I’d hope a “best mind” would be, above all, empathetic. Concerned about the well being of their fellow humans. Philosophical about the state of the world. Patient. Curious. Wise and not just smart.That we keep putting greedy assholes on a “best minds” pedestal due to their ability to exploit others for personal profit is part of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
    1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and    is just a natural part of the way the world works.
    2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
    3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Attention Is All You Need" introduces a novel architecture for machine translation called the Transformer. This model relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence, which is typical in previous sequence-to-sequence models. The Transformer demonstrates improved performance by allowing for greater parallelization and efficiency during training while maintaining robust accuracy in translation tasks. It also proposes mechanisms like multi-head attention and positional encodings to effectively handle sequence data. The findings suggest that the Transformer can achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmark translation datasets, positioning it as a cornerstone for future advancements in natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

Popular media is reenforcing hatred or anything that sponsors them, especially to weaker groups. Less repercussions and more clicks/money to be made I guess.While Politicians may hate each other, Scientists love to work with other aspiring Scientists who have similar ambitions and the only competition is in achieving measurable success and the reward it means to the greater public.Without any bias, but it's genuinely admirable when companies release their sources to enable faster scientific progress cycles. It's ironic that this company is dedicated to finance, yet shares their progress, while non-profits and companies dedicated purely to AI are locking all knowledge about their findings from access.Are there other companies like DeepSeek that you know of that commonly release great papers? I am following Mistral already, but I'd love to enrich my sources of publications that I consume. Highly appreciated!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeepSeek R1 is by far the best at writing prose of any model, including Grok-3, GPT-4o, o1-pro, o3, claude, etc.Paste in a snippet from a book and ask the model to continue the story in the style of the snippet.  It's surprising how bad most of the models are.Grok-3 comes in a close second, likely because it is actually DeepSeek R1 with a few mods behind the scenes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see deekseek using the correct (and much more idiomatic) term "inference-time scaling", instead of the grotesque construction of "test-time compute" that openAI came up with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578430</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is generally something about the Gemini models which feels a bit different than Claude, ChatGPT or Mistral.I always have the feeling that I'm chatting with a model oriented towards engineering tasks. The seriousness, lack of interest of being humorous or cool.I don't know if this is because I interact with Gemini only through AI Studio, and it may have different system instructions (apart from those one can add oneself, which I never do) than the one at gemini.google.com.I never use gemini.google.com because of the lack of a simple export feature. And it's not even possible to save one chat to disk (well, neither do the others), I just wish it did.AI Studio saving to Google Drive is really useful. I lets you download the chat, strip it of verbose things like the thinking process, and reuse it in a new chat.I wish gemini.google.com had a "Save as Markdown" per answer and for the complete chat (with a toggle to include/exclude the thinking process). Then it would be a no brainer for me.It's the same as if Google Docs would not have an "Download.." menu entry but you could only "save" the documents via Takeout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Next, in response to a question about the vulnerabilities in the Salt Typhoon description, Sec-Gemini v1 outputs not only vulnerability details (thanks to its integration with OSV data, the open-source vulnerabilities database operated by Google), but also contextualizes the vulnerabilities with respect to threat actors (using Mandiant data).I remain still skeptical about LLMs in this space, although I might be proven wrong, as often happens. Nevertheless, OSV has already been a big advance, so it is great that it gets a further commitment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using AI systems for high-speed security actions, proactive and reactive, seems necessary but not sufficient:I expect attackers will also use AI systems, trained on the latest in effective attacks. What about defense would make defenders' AI systems more effective than attackers'?I think it's necessary because, if the attackers use AI systems then the defenders need to keep up.Also, we need to be creating far more secure systems to start with. Now it is, to a degree, security through obscurity - something is secure when attackers can't find the bugs fast enough. Security through obsurity wouldn't seem to work well when the attacker uses AI software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586786</guid></item><item><title>23.

Every demand of the simplest bourgeois financial reform, of the most ordinary liberalism, of the most formal republicanism, of the most shallow democracy, is simultaneously castigated as an “attempt on society” and stigmatized as “socialism.” And finally the high priests of “religion and order” themselves are driven with kicks from their Pythian tripods, hauled out of their beds in the darkness of night, put in prison vans, thrown into dungeons or sent into exile; their temple is razed to the ground, their mouths are sealed, their pens broken, their law torn to pieces in the name of religion, of property, of the family, of order. Bourgeois fanatics for order are shot down on their balconies by mobs of drunken soldiers, their domestic sanctuaries profaned, their houses bombarded for amusement – in the name of property, of the family, of religion, and of order.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook made a personal $1 million "donation" to the Trump inauguration in January 2025:&gt; Cook, a proud Alabama native, believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity, the sources said.https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-mil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555696</guid></item><item><title>24.

Is there any support beyond the wrist, or how resistive is it when you press the buttons?  Have you considered 2 hands too?  Do you feel like you've maxed out the number of comfortably reachable keys?  I guess you can't have keys off to the side since you can't move your hand relative to the keyboard.  Does the thumb do anything currently?I'm in this niche market too... although I don't really have an immediate use case beyond someday being more portable.  Also had some issues with XR glasses and fov being reduced further by eye-glass distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43588420</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly every one of my clients have been invoice scammed. The amounts are typically five figures.When we onboard a new customer, I send a packet with payment information including how to direct deposit. It has this information:- Our routing/account number. We sweep the funds out of this account nearly instantly once the deposits are made. The bank account’s purpose is to accept direct deposits and nothing else. The account number we transmit over the phone so at least it’s less likely to end up sitting in a (compromised) e-mail box.- Our mailing address, which is a PO Box.- Some information on invoice scams, including an offer to review any suspicious requests free of charge. A customer takes us up on this every few months… so far we have yet to see one legitimate one.- A warning to never, ever accept changes for our payment information or mailing address unless told to do so in person by an officer of the company, with a list of the current officers.- If in doubt, mail a check to the PO Box instead of direct deposit.- A warning not to trust information sent via email, fax, phone calls (voice changers are a real thing), or from an employee/officer other than the one they usually interact with, and such a change must be confirmed with a phone call to a different officer.- A recommendation to also contact our local credit union (where we deposit payments from our customers) if they feel something is suspicious.- We have an internal rule that any change to bank accounts requires a meeting of 3 officers, in person or over the Google Meet we normally use for video calls (no phone calls) with meeting minutes conducted for the change. The change must be unanimous and the change can’t be put in for 30 days unless an emergency. Emergencies must be coordinated with a responsible person at the bank, in person. (Sorry, but this means no fintech etc. type of banks.) We recommend our customers to do the same.The biggest liability is that it would be hard for us to change bank accounts.We get an attempt on an invoice scam or otherwise every few weeks. So far we haven’t lost a penny of company funds due to fraud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It irritates me to read that people have lost their pension. Surely this should read, the pension fund has lost their pension due to "it safely breach"?
If a bank gets robbed they don't steal my money but the banks right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose it depends if it's worse than reported currently, but it seems to me that with only 600 accounts losing an average of ~$800 each (and I'm going to go out on a limb and assume the users had poor password security), the fast detection and the immediate action to lock it down, there was a good and effective response by the companies attacked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580101</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "advantage-weighted regression" (AWR) in reinforcement learning (RL) and its relation to "advantage smoothing," which aims to improve the stability and efficiency of policy learning in RL algorithms. It explains how advantage smoothing can mitigate issues related to non-stationarity and variance in training by aligning the updates more closely with the relevant state-action distributions. The author shares insights on the theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and potential benefits of using advantage smoothing in training RL agents, highlighting its importance in enhancing performance and stability in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting idea, but I'm sceptical of the advantages."there is more Co2" is valid for cars burning fuel. But as soon as you recuperate (even in a hybrid) you might only have a fraction of the losses any more. Adjusting the speed more aggressively is possible, without breaking, with little loss. I totally agree that stop-and-go is annoying, but looking into the future, Co2 should not be a reason for the vehicles in 5-10 years when the research can be rolled out.Is "slamming the brakes" still happening? Around here you have dynamic speed limit signs on the highway. In high traffic everybody then goes a little slower, but smoothly.I suspect that if a road is loaded beyond max throughput, this method will also fail, even harder.
Let me explain: I remember a graph from communications theory. With improving error correcting codes in transmission, you can get a clean signal for even worse channel conditions. But once it fails you will not have a signal any more. The better the code, the steeper the cutoff. Whereas without in FM radio, the degrade in user experience is also gradual.So the analogy goes like this: I would expect that you could possibly load the road with another 10% more vehicles. But if one day you have 15% more, the blockage will be even worse than before. 
Could be worth simulating throughput for various loading situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a certain satisfaction in anticipating these stop and go waves while driving, and timing it so that you catch the tail just as it starts moving again - the goal being to use the brake as little as possible and ideally only need to adjust acceleration. I don't really get why people feel the need to repeatedly accelerate up and then slam on the brakes, when leaving reasonable gaps makes everything go smoother.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice that this worked without need for communication between cars.This should be a built-in feature of adaptive cruise control in regular cars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555994</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing legal battle over the estate of Ayn Rand, particularly focusing on the actions of her longtime associate Leonard Peikoff and the implications for Rand’s intellectual legacy. It explores themes of control, philosophical inheritance, and the diverging paths between Rand's original ideas and their interpretations by subsequent followers. The piece also reflects on how this dispute highlights the complexities of maintaining a coherent philosophical movement in the aftermath of a founder's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584663"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tragic irony of Objectivism is perfectly captured in Peikoff's life story. A man who dedicated himself to a philosophy of radical independence ended up defining his entire existence through dependency. First on Rand, now apparently on his caregiver-turned-wife.I met Peikoff at an ARI event in 2009. He was surprisingly warm in person, but you could see the weight of being "the heir" in how defensively he responded to even mild questions about Rand's work. Now reading about the fracture with his daughter over the estate, it's like watching Atlas Shrugged's plot play out in real life: the bitter disputes over Rand's intellectual property mirroring the novel's battles over physical resources.What's most disturbing isn't the personal drama but what this reveals about how Objectivism operates in practice. For a philosophy obsessed with reason and independence, its institutional guardians seem remarkably focused on excommunication, loyalty tests, and controlling access to primary sources. The gap between preaching individualism while demanding conformity has always been the movement's central contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also get such energy from Atlas Shrugged, I don't understand why. I know that the good guys are very carefully crafted, they don't cheat, they don't do things like lobbying to win. They don't compromise on their world view to the extreme. They don't have children, that makes it all easier, but also less real.Raised christian but feeling burned out by the contradictions, the emptiness of trying to live for others (it's killing for relationships I can tell you), the mental struggle to rationalize all the rules, I too felt that spark. I realize dogmatism is always bad but that voice inside keeps saying: It's not when the theory is perfect! The truth is knowable and can be discovered through reason. How super comforting (and damn that Incompleteness Theorem I learned about later).I don't know what it is, my hunger for a system? For rules to make sense of the world? Whatever it is, Rand's philosophy remains so appealing. It's probably the reason I started a company, walk into meetings now boldly, with a goal, why I enjoy things now, just to enjoy myself. As a rational, healthy human, there is nothing wrong with that, in contrast to what my upbringing tried to instill in me.Perhaps that's it, it liberated my from a confining worldview. Perhaps another worldview could have done the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and wasn't impressed by either. The author never got the "show, not tell" memo. Long, long speeches.(In the movie version of The Fountainhead, Howard Roarke's architecture is terrible. His buildings resemble 1960s US housing projects such as the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. There's good minimalism, but that's not it.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584663</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;A photo calorie app called Cal.ai, created by two teenagers, has gained significant popularity, achieving over a million downloads. The app allows users to track their calorie intake by simply taking pictures of their food. The success of Cal.ai highlights the potential for innovative technology in health and fitness and underscores how young entrepreneurs can make a substantial impact in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has participated in calorie-tracking for an extended period of time can tell you that the visual appearance of food can be highly misleading to the number of calories in it.I'm all for making it easier for people to lose weight but this app may honestly have the reverse effect. If the app estimates calories too low (and therefore the individual eats more), many people will get frustrated with the lack of progress and give up. If the app estimates too high, the individual will lose weight, but diet fatigue and other negative side effects of being at a &gt;500 calorie deficit may make the diet too difficult to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a friend who came to me with the same idea. In challenge of the idea I sent a picture of some chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, and an other picture with the same chopped vegetables drizzled with a copious amount of olive oil. I asked if they can tell which one is which. The difference was hundreds of calories and you could not tell which one is which (least of all how much oil there is on the one with the oil.)That of course feels like a "weird" edge case, but it illustrates the general problem that butter/oil/sugars can pack a lot of calories and have no or almost no visual signature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My reasoning for evaluating the relevancy of this app:1. If the food being scanned has a nutrition label, I don't need this app.2. If there's no nutrition label, the app can't possibly extrapolate the nutritional information. It can't estimate portion size or the ingredients in the recipe.3. If the app can't extrapolate nutritional information, I don't need this app.4. I don't need this app.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563580</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember getting so deep in the weeds doing this kind of thing in responsively-resized Flash sites, a challenge similar to doing it in canvas. But what at that time I was trying to do (and what I'd really love to see now) was to reproduce runaround text the way you would have it in Quark or Pagemaker (or that newer Adobe program). Justifiable text flow within an arbitrary closed path shape, so you could have multi-column text with adjustable gutters, running  with curved borders around scaling embedded graphics. My solutions for that involved a lot of setup/tear-down of invisible text fields relying on native text handling, line by line or paragraph by paragraph, then a lot of remeasuring, and then a lot of optimization to make it more performant. I wrote a similar set of code for handling text in generated PDF files.As an old school print designer, I would love to see a return to a web with multi-column text on desktop, that reformatted to single column on mobile, and graphics runarounds much more complicated in shape than what a float can do. The art of typographic layout has been lost on the web, because those things are hard. An OS general-purpose engine that could handle layouts like that in any screen size, on Canvas or using absolute positioned divs or generating PDFs, would go a long way toward restoring artistic originality in the "layouting" of online publications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can count on one hand the number of times I've needed something like this in the last decade. But I'd also need to count the same number of times I've implemented a less than ideal solution that's ended up in prod. Great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi OP! Thanks for sharing.I don’t totally understand the point of this. Why would you want to use a Canvas renderer for this use case? If you want to render a massive table, apps will render a subset of it on regular HTML elements like EveryUUID [1].1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342382&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43583478</guid></item><item><title>30.

I fear that Debian main may have already went into a state where it is not able to rebuild itself at all anymore: the presence and assumption of non-free firmware and non-Debian signed binaries may have already corrupted the ability for Debian main to rebuild itself. To be able to complete the idempotent and bootstrapped rebuild of Debian, this needs to be worked out.Are any nonfree packages used as build inputs? If not, just ("just") bootstrap guix on a blobless platform, and cross build Debian from that&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an alternative to Guix with a much more strict supply chain security policy, consider: https://stagex.tools/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534143</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex legacy of Yoko Ono, delving into her contributions to art and music as well as the controversies surrounding her, particularly in relation to her marriage with John Lennon. It examines how Ono's work has often been overshadowed by public perception and critique, and discusses her impact on feminist art and culture, questioning the narrative that has historically framed her as a divisive figure. The piece highlights the need to reassess Ono's role and influence in the artistic landscape, considering both her achievements and the ongoing discussions about her identity as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;

Was she wierd? Sure.Was she wierder than anyone else in those times? Not really. The Chuck Berry gig is just a moment, it doesn't define her. The screaming shtick was a thing, sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;John got tired of the Beatles, his drug use made things worse. Paul's perfectionism did its part as well. Yoko was a distraction.She's a provocateur, art is the medium she uses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586113</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for the Bash INI Parser, created by user lsferreira42, provides a script designed for reading and parsing INI files in Bash. It offers functionalities to retrieve values from sections and keys within a standard INI file format, making it easier to manage configuration options in shell scripts. The repository includes documentation for usage, examples, and installation instructions, enhancing its usability for developers looking to integrate INI file support in their Bash scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My rule has always been that once a shell script gets too complex, it's time to rewrite it in real language. This library is way, way beyond that threshold.My recommendation for rewrite is "python with only stdlib". Using pip-installed libraries brings in the famous packaging problems, but you don't have to use it! Python's stdlib is fully "batteries included", and it has lots of useful things like ini file parser. And if your system has bash, it often has python as well, or at least it's easy to install. Things might get a bit more verbose, but they would be much more reliable and debuggable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For similar functionality have a look at crudini,
which is a utility designed for interacting with ini files from shell scripts:https://github.com/pixelb/crudini&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hint: for cicd usage you can parse ini files with git, often present in such situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43539892</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the peculiarities and unexpected behaviors in JavaScript, highlighting common pitfalls and quirks that developers may encounter. It explains concepts such as type coercion, the oddity of `this` in different contexts, the distinction between `==` and `===`, and the differences in variable scoping with `var`, `let`, and `const`. The author provides examples to illustrate these behaviors, aiming to raise awareness and help developers navigate JavaScript's idiosyncrasies effectively. Overall, the piece serves as a guide to understanding and managing the complexities of JavaScript coding.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many mistakes in section 2. The author seems to fundamentally misunderstand block scoping vs lexical scoping, and interactions when deferring execution to the next run of the event loop.In the first example:    for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i));
    }
    // prints "0 1 2" — as expected
    
    let i = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i));
    }
    // prints "3 3 3" — what?

i's scope is outside the for loop in the second example, and the setTimeouts execute in the call stack (e.g. the next run of the event loop), after i has finished incrementing in the first event loop iterationConsider that you'd have the same issue with the older `var` keyword which is lexically scoped    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i));
    }
    // prints "3 3 3" because i is not block-scoped

If for some reason you really need some work run in the next call stack, and you need to use the value of a variable which is scoped outside the loop and modified inside the loop, you can also define a function (or use an iife) to pass the value of i in the current iteration into (rather than getting the reference of i in the event loop's next call stack)    let i = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      (
        (x)=&gt;setTimeout(()=&gt;console.log(x))
      )(i)
    }
    // prints 1 2 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complaining about the for loop behaviour seems odd. Variables declared in the expression section of the loop are scoped to the loop body - this is generally reasonable and the least likely to produce errors.Notably, Go initially decided to stick with the C-style approach and have the scope be outside the loop, and has since decided that the tiny performance improvement this provides isn't worth the many many times it's tripped people up, and has changed the semantics in recent versions: https://go.dev/blog/loopvar-preview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember properly learning JS from “The Good Parts” book, which makes it known from the start that JS is a nasty language but if you ignore many sharp edges it can be nice and elegant. I think this is especially true with (a subset of) TS. All you need is a very, very strict linter, and then you get to pretend you’re working in a mostly solid language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43574026</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That grub has security vulnerabities does not surprise me, it's just too big. That's why Lennart recommends systemd-boot. (Incidently a Microsoft employee, but I have no information that he would have been involved in these discoveries.) U-boot again is typical embedded software, a field generally known  more for hacks than strict programming practices. So I cannot say I would be shocked. That said, I would be surprised if systemd-boot or Microsoft's loader had zero vulnerabilities hiding somewhere.When does Microsoft open their source for searching vulnerabilities?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"To demonstrate how efficient our product, CoPilot is, we've decided to use it to uncover vulnerabilities in competing products."Gee, how clever and thoughtful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well if Microsoft was as serious about security as they could be, they would have made sure the NT6 boot routine would boot Linux without needing Grub a long time ago.With the resources they have, and these unique findings AI has helped them discover, they should now be in the ideal position to rapidly correct this deficiency in their own bootloader, so that nobody will ever need to use Grub again.With this level of expertise, now enhanced by AI, and so much effort already behind them so far, it shouldn't take much to push this over the finish line, provided they have an effective enough organization when it comes to enhancing the security of PC users overall.  After all, they don't even have to worry about addressing Macs.I know the engineers are brilliant enough by far, and with nothing holding them back, we should be able to expect a minor revision of of the NT bootloader like this to be arriving any day now.According to what I see in the article, this would be one of the most timely &amp; useful security patches to show up on Windows Update, I hope they don't drop the ball on this one.Patch Tuesday is next week but they seem so close they could probably push this critical correction out before that, so watch for it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538073</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A long time ago, Britain was the dominant economic power in the world.Britain had a massive trade deficit with India. It imported far more from India than it exported to India.But what Britain did was import massive amounts from India and made high value goods at home and provided high value services that couldn't be provided elsewhere.Should it have flipped the other way? In 1800, should Britain have suddenly shifted gears and started massively exporting to India in order to balance the trade?Sure, India was a colony and not a mere trading partner, so no need to argue about that. But the US is also an empire that has bases around the world and has many countries in an economic chokehold. The situation is similar in a modern context since official colonization is kind of gone. The US takes in lower value products from around the world and sells them back to the original country at a higher price due to some sort of added value.Should America do the opposite? Should we drop all of our high value scientific and medical research, drop our engineering, and go all in on making t-shirts to balance the trade deficit? Because we very well could do this. We could steal away the fine industry of Cambodia and Bangladesh and have them buy all our t-shirts and balance the deficit pretty quickly. But is that a long term benefit?Cambodia and Bangladesh are countries that can't really afford to buy massive amounts of American high tech exports or foods. But they're essentially colonies that export goods to other countries, and through accumulating wealth through that development, more people can afford to buy American high tech products. But we're demanding that these countries buy lots of American products now with money that they don't have. The only way to balance that is to make things they can afford. Which means low value items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, and worrying at the time, but he clearly turned out to be wrong. The trend never stopped [1] and is not obviously responsible for any negative economic trend. The trend has continued [2]. The thing to worry about is probably not that it is happening, but who is holding these investments.[1]: https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international...[2]: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1HrHY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, you don't want to have "the world" own shares of american companies?Okay, let europe just sell all their stocks and ETF. But also, let them build alternatives to all american products. Let them keep the money they are spending for their Windows and Office licenses, their Netflix and Disney plans. Let them no longer create ad revenues on youtube. Let them buy korean Samsung phones instead of american iPhones.Would that be a good deal for the american people?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43579908</guid></item><item><title>39.

Have you looked into https://k6.io/ ? IMO it strikes a good balance of being simple to start with, but flexible to support advanced use cases if needed.At the very least, the first thing I would like to see is a comparison of your platform to existing tools and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. Internally we made a similar tool for performance testing applications, including fault and latency simulation of dependencies. It also includes analysis of resource consumption and whether performance and/or resource consumption have increased or decreased.This is now the second time a similar tool has popped up here at HN, maybe we should open source it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks neat, but I hate the "limited free" thing. What's the actual price?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of growing buffers in data management to prevent the need for excessive data copying. It emphasizes the importance of having efficient buffer systems to manage data effectively, reducing the computational load and improving overall performance. The author outlines strategies for implementing these buffers, highlights common challenges, and provides best practices for optimizing data processing workflows, ultimately aiming to streamline operations and enhance data handling efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a major concurrency problem in Wine, the Windows emulator for Linux, related to this, which I encountered several years ago. Wine has its own set of DLLs which provide malloc-level services. When you grow a buffer, but it can't be grown in place, a new buffer has to be allocated and the old buffer copied. The trouble is that the copying takes place while holding a spinlock on the entire buffer pool. I had a multi-thread Rust program go into futex congestion and drop performance by two orders of magnitude due to this. 20 threads were all stuck compute-bound trying to acquire the lock. There are several layers of locking involved, and they fight.Wine bug only; works OK on real Windows.[1][2] (bugs.winehq.org seems to be down)[1] https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=37688[2] https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54979&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before using realloc, you have to do this:  void *sane_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
  {
     if (ptr == 0) {
       return malloc(size);
     } else if (size == 0) {
       free(ptr);
       return 0;
     } else {
       return realloc(ptr, size);
     }
  }

ISO C realloc has braindamaged corner cases. Some implementations behave like the above, in which case you can just have #define sane_realloc realloc on those targets.With the above you can initialize a vector to null, with size zero, and use nothing but realloc for the entire lifetime management: growing it from zero to nonzero size allocates it, shrinking down to zero frees it.malloc(0) doesn't necessarily return null; it can return some non-null pointer that can be passed to free. We can get such a thing if we call sane_realloc(0, 0), and can avoid that if we change the malloc line to:   return size ? malloc(size) : 0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first time I encountered the memory fragmentation problem common in hashtables wasn't even in a hashtable implementation, it was in a program that used realloc heavily, and doubled the buffer size every time.This was causing massive problems trying to concurrently read a stream over the network and start parsing it, because the realloc had trouble finding appropriately sized fragments. Once I pointed it out to the lead dev he used a different strategy and cut the load time on a multi-megabyte file by a factor of ten.Much later on I would learn that he could have also solved the problem just by adjusting the growth factor to 1.5 instead of 2x.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43540070</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the perceived economic decline in Britain, exploring various factors contributing to the feeling of poverty among its citizens despite economic data suggesting otherwise. It addresses issues such as stagnation in wage growth, rising living costs, and the impact of political decisions on economic stability. The author highlights the psychological aspects of economic insecurity and argues that the narrative around wealth and poverty in the UK is influenced by social and political contexts, ultimately shaping public perception and attitudes towards economic well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581672"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run an IT consultancy and often work in both commercial buildings and private residences across the UK. When it comes to the latter—trust me, the elites (and even the upper-middle class) still have an extraordinary amount of money.What’s changed is that no one cares about the public sphere anymore. You wouldn’t believe the contrast between Britain’s crumbling high streets and the lavish interiors of some of these homes. I’ve seen marble floors, $10K TVs, $100K kitchens, $150K bathrooms. Home offices decked out with $50K worth of gear. Wine cellars, indoor spas, private gyms—you name it.Even on the commercial side, it’s wild. It’s not uncommon to walk into a privately-owned or government-owned building and be greeted by a $5 million art piece in the lobby. Then you start looking around and adding up the costs—“they probably spent $10K just on that fancy trim around the doorframe.” Or you notice a particularly heavy door, Google it, and realize it costs $15K per door. Then you start counting the doors—there are thousands. The rabbit hole goes deep, and the amount of wealth becomes staggering. It’s just hidden in plain sight.But all of this wealth is cloistered. No one’s investing in the public-facing world. There’s a broad cultural resignation—from the elites to the average person: “Why bother fixing the outside world? Just survive the workday and retreat into your private kingdom.” The mindset has shifted toward building personal fortresses rather than shared prosperity.So yes, Britain feels poor—but it’s not because the money is gone. It’s because it’s been withdrawn from the commons and buried behind closed doors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a key part of the 'poor' feeling in day to day experience comes from councils' inability to do maintenance, things like pot holes, children's play equipment, public toilet, general upkeep on public spaces and services like libraries. In the grand scheme of things this isn't too expensive but it's been cut to the bone due to way local government funding works. This is explored in the article:&gt;  in large part because they’re mandated to write blank cheques for social care with no support or strategy from central government. Individual cases in Central Bedfordshire are now costing up to £750,000 per year, a quarter of the entire libraries and leisure budget and an amount that is rising rapidly with no apparent ceiling. As I wrote previously, “In a single year, residential care costs for children have increased by £2,000 per child… per week,” taking the average cost for a single case from ~£200,000 to ~£300,000 per child per year, again with little explanation as to where the money is going or how this is even possible.&gt; Similarly, “school transport costs have increased by over 100% - from £9m to £20m - in just 4 years” - that’s driven by an unexplained rise in the number of SEND pupils eligible for support and it amounts to roughly the same as - deep breath - the transport, roads, parking, libraries, leisure, housing benefit, public protection and safety budgets combined. Central Bedfordshire Council is not an outlier here - collectively, council overspends on SEND services are set to hit £2bn in the next year, risking further bankruptcies. Again this is not about pitting children against libraries, but asking if we seriously believe we’re addressing either of these things well?Local councils have to pay the very large bills for social care and supporting SEND children but have basically little control over how it's spent or levers to help control the bills.Fixing this so councils can once again spend relative minor amounts of money improving the public realm could go a long way to improving day to day experience. Definitely some other large structural problems (see the huge costs of HS2) but it would provide a noticeable improvement in people's lives and potentially isn't too hard for a government willing to make some bold changes around taxation, local government funding and providing proper national strategy and funding on social care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything that provides any service or assistance to normal life has been sold off and rented back to us at enormous cost, often with many of extra financial scalping included in the systems we are forced to rely on.
And a percentage of the extracted wealth is used to push political and public narrative to incentivise the selling off more.Local authorities are forced to sell off assets and fire direct employees, then get charged a fortune to provide basic services and child and adult social care.And for contracts and outsourcing, the ownership of the contract itself is the thing that gives value, not providing the actual service.  Creating a whole set of perverse incentives.A council should look at a pot hole in a road as a massive opportunity.  Here is a chance to provide good quality work for local people and local resources, but the opposite happens.We have a whole layer of service retailers e.g. for electricity and gas and communications, who are not more than a spreadsheet speculating on long term prices, a call centre and a web site.  Their entire business model being based on a) not messing up the spreadsheet calculation b) enough people being lazy and not renewing or switching their contract every year.Our financial services industry has massive positive PR, seen as a net good for the country.  When in reality it is focused not on basic things like providing banking and direct insurance, but in attracting our best and brightest individuals from around the country and instead of having them put their talents to something productive.  Instead reward them for creating and maintaining complex systems to move wealth around, asset strip regions, hide it from tax and create a layer of gambling and financial products on top of these systems.I could go on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581672</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Fantastically Wrong: The Hollow Earth" from Wired explores the concept of a hollow Earth, a theory suggesting that the planet has vast, empty spaces inside it. It discusses the historical origins of this idea, its portrayal in literature and mythology, and the figures who advocated for it, such as John Cleves Symmes Jr. and Edgar Rice Burroughs. The narrative highlights the scientific disproval of the hollow Earth theory, explaining how modern geology and physics have shown that the Earth is solid and composed of various layers.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.inverse.com/science/hollow-earth-theory-history-...&gt; According to a 1716 paper mentioned in the book, Hollow Earth: The Long and Curious History of Imagining Strange Lands, Halley devised the Hollow Earth theory as a way to explain strange disturbances in the magnetic field that were connected to the aurora borealis — Earth’s natural light show. Halley was right about the magnetic field, but not so much about Hollow Earth..&gt; Years later, War of 1812 veteran and explorer, John Cleves Symmes, seized on the Hollow Earth theory.. to justify American expansionism.. into Antarctica. Similar to Halley, Symmes believed that the Earth was made of a hollow shell 800 miles thick, but he added his own twist: there were openings to Earth’s hollow core at both the North and South Pole. These he called “Symmes holes.” There, he believed that light — and human explorers — could descend underneath the surface into the hollow core.There was also a German sci-fi novel "Two Planets" by Kurd Lasswitz (1897), which influenced a young Werner von Braun who would later contribute to German rocketry and American space program, and write his own sci-fi novel about Mars exploration, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39571588&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/A5q1E&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, I happen to know a bit about this because his cult compound is a state park in Florida, in Bonita Springs. Highly recommend visiting! Say hi to the loose big turtles!The park is presented as a lovely old commune with vintage bungalows, a rare place where women actually ran things in the late 1800's and had a lot of freedom within the community to create art, plays, and raise their kids. A lot of the women were widows and this was basically the only option for them aside from marrying their dead husband's brother, or some other arcane ritual of the day. They paid for the upkeep and food for the "commune" by staging plays, and the men dealt with the outside world and negotiated for such transactions (to keep up external appearances of a patriarchy, something that was totally expected back then.)My wife and I were touring the place, having a good old time, and when we entered the community gathering hall/church, my wife started slapping my arm repeatedly to get my attention. She's gasping for air in an almost shocked laughter. She pointed to the giant model of the split-open Earth as interior, like the one shown at the top this article. The whole commune were hollow Earthers!!Of course, the bloom was then very much off the rose. A few things to know about Teed, in addition to the hollow Earth stuff, which we subsequently learned by reading more deeply into the interpretive museum text, therein:1: Teed believed he was Jesus Christ, or at least, that he would come back with Christ. When he died, the cult left him on the porch for a few weeks, waiting for him to get back up. The Sheriff had to come and demand they bury him, because the stink was so bad from the rotting corpse in the hot Florida sun. A testament to the power of belief, or delusion, you decide.2: The last Koreshanty-ist (As they were called) born and living on the Florida property admitted she was wrong about the Earth when she watched the moon landing on TV in 1969 in her bungalow.3: Teed believed his theory was true because he said if you walked in a flat, straight line in any direction, you would eventually hit an incline. This was absolutely true! BECAUSE THEY LIVED IN A SWAMP.4: Of course, 100% as expected, despite the ladies running the cult via committee and being very free in the cult society... All men except Teed were to remain celibate, but--OMG!-- there were plenty of babies! Teed 100% did the cult leader thing and had relations with every woman on the property. That's the real reason he built the cult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555728</guid></item><item><title>43.

I think the DUT was an EV engine, the damage was quite impressive. The controller capacitors had blown, the output shaft was broken, the torque sensor had a 250Nm offset, the rotor had contacted the stator and destroyed the coils.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool, I thought about this when testing regenerative braking parameters on the electric cars I put together.I ended up just spinning the motor with a hand drill and later fine tuning in an empty car park.Your solution is much better to get engine hours and a proper load on your test piece in a lab environment!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577927</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chef did not make a clean transition into the immutable world. Chef Client was great for persistent infrastructure, but the options got dicier once we started talking about pre-provisioned infrastructure like image building:1. Chef Solo (how I last used it when attempting this), which felt intentionally hobbled. All you needed was one poorly-behaved cookbook that called `search` and the bets were off.2. Chef Zero, which was unnecessarily complicated for being Chef Solo that wasn't intentionally hobbled, so much so that I kept using Solo for awhile after its deprecation.3. Chef Client, against a Chef Server that was run either for your other persistent infrastructure, or just to have a place to put the cookbooks. Heaven forbid you weren't cleaning up all of those dynamically-created nodes, though...I still think Chef's Ruby DSL is much more natural than the YAML manifests used by Ansible, and the ability to integrate at the source level with custom Ruby code is a killer feature as soon as any complexity enters the mix. But I almost certainly would not be using Chef in a greenfield deployment these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're still fighting with Chef slowness, hard to debug, complicated setup, you may want to consider Pyinfra.It is very well thoughout and simple to design and run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't encountered any Chef code in almost ten years. For the stragglers not yet primarily on Kubernetes and Terraform, I see Ansible and some extra Terraform. Maybe I see some Salt here and there.These are just my anecdotes, for sure, but (also anecdotal) I rarely hear of other "ops" type people using Chef, and most of the ones I know never got more than just their feet wet with Chef (the SaltStack beta was out early enough to avoid Chef).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43585354</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Germany's Deutschlandticket, which offers unlimited travel for a fixed monthly fee across public transportation networks, is seen as a key initiative to promote sustainable mobility and reduce carbon emissions. The ticket aims to encourage the use of public transport instead of cars, thus contributing positively to environmental goals. Studies indicate that, alongside improving transport accessibility, the initiative could lead to a significant reduction in traffic congestion and pollution levels, helping Germany meet its climate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

I even bought WP Office, but even that tries to force you into their cloud drive.I really wish there was a fully compatible Microsoft Office that I could use across my Apple devices that doesn’t shove some random cloud solution and end up with my files spread all over the place.

It highlights the complexities involved in creating machines that can mimic human cognitive abilities, emphasizing the differences between narrow AI and AGI.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Last week, the ARC Prize team released an updated test, called ARC-AGI-2, and it appears to have sent the AIs back to the drawing board. The full o3 model has not yet been tested, but a version of o1 dropped from 32 percent on the original puzzles to just 3 percent on the new version, and a “mini” version of o3 currently available to the public dropped from roughly 30 percent to below 2 percent. (An OpenAI spokesperson declined to say whether the company plans to run the benchmark with o3.) Other flagship models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have achieved roughly 1 percent, if not lower. Human testers average about 60 percent.Arc AGI is the main reason why I don't trust static bench marks.If you don't have an essentially infinite set to draw your validation data from then a large enough model will memorize it as part of its developer teams KPIs.Forget all these fancy benchmarks. If you want to saturate any model today give it a string and a grammar and ask it to generate the string from the grammar. I've had _every_ model fail this on regular grammars with strings of more than 4 characters long.LLMs are the solution to natural language, which is a huge deal. They aren't the solution to reasoning which is still best solved with what used to be called symbolic AI before it started working, e.g. sat solvers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Chollet, a French computer scientist and one of the industry’s sharpest skepticsI feel like this description really buries the lede on Chollet's expertise. (For those who don't know, he's the creator of and lead contributor[0] to Keras)[0]https://github.com/keras-team/keras/graphs/contributors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to dismiss Chollet’s work, but I’m starting to think he need prove nothing to even the muggles. For example, nearly any endurance athlete stands a good chance of being a Strava user. If you run in those circles, have you heard a single person with anything good to say about Strava’s “Athletic Intelligence”? Garmin is rolling out a beta right now that includes “AI Insights” or summat. Same deal: useless summaries like “you ran 5 miles today, which contributes to your aerobic base”. I could do better with a database and some if/else statements. And Garmin wants a subscription for this.  (It’s included in Strava’s subscription, but I suppose you’re still paying for it.) And so now the memes tend toward “dumb AI insight of the day” on many online forums.Seems to me that a lot of folks are enjoying having an LLM rewrite their email or whatever, but I wonder how many are actually buying the rest of it? The companies themselves sure aren’t helping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43587628</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the enriching experience of pursuing side projects, emphasizing their potential to foster creativity, enhance skills, and provide a sense of fulfillment.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an interesting read. I'm in the complete opposite camp. I can't pick up a game controller for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I'm wasting time.This has lead to many, many side projects throughout the years, which I tend to like a zen garden[1]. Pruning, refining, improving, and sometimes rewriting.As soon as I work out the game mechanics of any game, I just see it as just content now, and there is nothing holding me back to play any longer. Same with watching TV shows or movies, I lose interest pretty quickly and feel an urge to create something.I've always been very in tune with time, our lack of it, and felt like consumption is a waste of time.That said I believe creativity is hormonal (that is only my personal belief, unproven). It comes and goes. Some days I can't stop creating, somedays I want netflix and chill. But that's 10 days cycle of sorts, 10 days on, 10 days off.Depending on where you live, it's perfectly normal that due to current events, or a personal loss in your life, etc. you might not feel the creative bug tickling you. The creative hormone might be totally wiped by your current environment or predicament; tiredness, anger, stress, all play into it.After all, since our early days in the caves, drawing on walls, Humans wouldn't do so unless they had safety, a full belly, and a warm fire. A place to call home. Creative time needs conditions to be filled.[1] https://noben.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just thinking about this yesterday. A few weeks or months ago I started learning something new from an online course.Because I like using Anki to help me remember, I started copy-pasting stuff from that course to a spreadsheet to then export it as a CSV to import into Anki.One thing leading to another, my spreadsheet quickly ended with weird formatting everywhere that would be converted through macros to HTML tags to style the resulting Anki notes.This was still implying much manual work, so I finally figured I could just scrape the lessons for which I want notes via some script, and get the resulting CSV with a simple command.I'm been working on that scraper for two weeks now, and I just realised yesterday that that's the most time I've spent on a side project since too long to remember, and it brings me joy and motivation in the evenings and weekends. Also, apart from the occasional script, I haven't wrote a line of code for years, and I don't know why I ever stopped coding since I love this so much. And last but not least, I decided to go for Python, and I've never learnt Python so it's quite a challenge but also a satisfactory experience.All in all, this side project is spaghetti code with a dirty hacks sauce, I would never open-source it,  and it's never going to be useful for someone other than me.But it feels like I'm dusting off my brain, and rediscovering skills and passions I had long forgotten. Like finally waking from a long slumber. I'm currently a bit depressed, struggle to focus, and feel burnt out, but at least I am motivated by something and I create something for me, and this makes all the rest bearable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel this in my bones.  Side projects are so cathartic and saved my sanity at $DAYJOB.  I don't care that I can't implement things the way I want, or how everything is spaghetti, or how much tech debt has piled up, my side projects is a blissful world that I invented.  It gives me the "I am Jack's crap codebase" fight club zen at work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43587380</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok so whas looking where to actually download the models. Looks its here:https://www.morphosource.org/catalog/media?locale=enBut you need to register account and file a request for each download.Edit: ok there is a filter option "Publication Status: Open Download" which gives you download without filing a request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Error 405 Slovenian users must use proxy.The project sounds interesting, but I can't see what it's about because they've apparently blacklisted (?) my entire country.ETA: Looks like this is just a news article. Perhaps linking the (less discriminatory) primary source would be a better idea: https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/gallery/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What might be an efficient way to view these if you don't work with 3-D models often. Is there a good viewer that allows 3-D rotation, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589989</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tried it for a bit. Paid one month of the subscription.The dashboard is incredibly clunky and at the time they didn't have SSL for db connections (not sure about now). A lot of stuff you need to know what you're doing like configuring tags for Traefik etc.The deal breaker was it didn't have zero downtime deploys. Any pending request when you update an app is simply killed.I was expecting something like Heroku or Vercel but this ain't it.Ended up concluding that if I wanted to run/deploy apps on my own VPS I'd just use Kamal or Dokku. Both have zero downtime deploys, certbot, proxy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was also looking at alternatives -K8S-based

It's really low maintenance, it has built in backups for your apps and databases, decent security by default, and is super easy to use. I log into the underlying VMs once per month to do an apt update/upgrade, and that's about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555996</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;General overview below, as the pages don't seem to be working well  Llama 4 Models:
  - Both Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design with 17B active parameters each.
  - They are natively multimodal: text + image input, text-only output.
  - Key achievements include industry-leading context lengths, strong coding/reasoning performance, and improved multilingual capabilities.
  - Knowledge cutoff: August 2024.

  Llama 4 Scout:
  - 17B active parameters, 16 experts, 109B total.
  - Fits on a single H100 GPU (INT4-quantized).
  - 10M token context window
  - Outperforms previous Llama releases on multimodal tasks while being more resource-friendly.
  - Employs iRoPE architecture for efficient long-context attention.
  - Tested with up to 8 images per prompt.

  Llama 4 Maverick:
  - 17B active parameters, 128 experts, 400B total.
  - 1M token context window.
  - Not single-GPU; runs on one H100 DGX host or can be distributed for greater efficiency.
  - Outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on coding, reasoning, and multilingual tests at a competitive cost.
  - Maintains strong image understanding and grounded reasoning ability.

  Llama 4 Behemoth (Preview):
  - 288B active parameters, 16 experts, nearly 2T total.
  - Still in training; not yet released.
  - Exceeds GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on STEM benchmarks (e.g., MATH-500, GPQA Diamond).
  - Serves as the “teacher” model for Scout and Maverick via co-distillation.

  Misc:
  - MoE Architecture: Only 17B parameters activated per token, reducing inference cost.
  - Native Multimodality: Unified text + vision encoder, pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model training observations from both Llama 3 and 4 papers:Meta’s Llama 3 was trained on ~16k H100s, achieving ~380–430 TFLOPS per GPU in BF16 precision, translating to a solid 38 - 43% hardware efficiency [Meta, Llama 3].For Llama 4 training, Meta doubled the compute, using ~32K H100s and switched to FP8 precision. Despite the precision gain, observed efficiency dropped to about 19.7%, with GPUs delivering ~390 TFLOPS out of a theoretical 1,979 FP8 TFLOPS [Meta, Llama 4].I am not the one to critique, and rather, this is a recognition of the enormous complexity of operating GPUs at this scale. Training massive models across tens of thousands of GPUs stretches today’s AI infrastructure to its limit.Besides accelerating inference workloads, advanced GPU optimizations can be integrated into training and fine-tuning pipelines. From various kernel optimization techniques (over 90) to increasing memory access efficiency and scaling up to cluster-wide resource coordination, efficiency can be maximized with some complex software.References:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can’t stop thinking about this article. I spent a long time in ad tech before switching to broader systems engineering. The author captures something I've struggled to articulate to friends and family about why I left the industry.The part that really struck me was framing advertising and propaganda as essentially the same mechanism - just with different masters. Having built targeting systems myself, this rings painfully true. The mechanical difference between getting someone to buy sneakers versus vote for a candidate is surprisingly small.What's frustrating is how the tech community keeps treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. We debate content moderation policies and algorithmic transparency, but rarely question the underlying attention marketplace that makes manipulation profitable in the first place.The uncomfortable truth: most of us in tech understand that today's advertising systems are fundamentally parasitic. We've built something that converts human attention into money with increasingly terrifying efficiency, but we're all trapped in a prisoner's dilemma where nobody can unilaterally disarm.Try this thought experiment from the article - imagine a world without advertising. Products would still exist. Commerce would still happen. Information would still flow. We'd just be freed from the increasingly sophisticated machinery designed to override our decision-making.Is this proposal radical? Absolutely. But sometimes the Overton window needs a sledgehammer.P.S. If you are curious about the relationship between Sigmund Freud, propaganda, and the origins of the ad industry, check out the documentary “Century of the Self”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fantastic article, I particularly like the point about humanity being more or less ad-free for much of it existence. I was just thinking about absurdity of advertising yesterday. As a life-long football fan (not soccer ;)), I was always bothered by the slow creep-in of those silly, mindless pre- and post-game interviews they do with players and managers nowadays. In the two decades since this has been happening it never occurred to me why these were a thing, until yesterday. In a lead up to a minor game, of course there was an interview with one of the players. In front of one of those panels with repetitive ads for various businesses. As it happens to be the case every time for the last 20ish years. Of course! The interviewees are just providing the mindless content, while my mind absorbs the background ads! So obvious, but it never occurred to me even once. Ad industry is really a cancer on society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This begs the question: how could you reliably distinguish advertising from other forms of free speech?The courts already distinguish "commercial speech" as a class of speech. Would we prevent all forms of commercial speech? What about a waiter asking you "would you like to try a rosé with that dish? It pairs very well together." Is that "advertising" that would need to be outlawed?What about giving out free samples? Is that advertising, and thus should be illegal?What about putting a sign up on your business that says the business name? Is that advertising?I hate advertising and propaganda. But the hard part IMO is drawing the line. Where's the line?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595269</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product manager ex. game designer with a number of puzzle/word game in operation here.- Having a timer (urgency) is usually not a very good idea for thinky games. If you insist on having a timer consider making it count upwards.- Additionally as other commenters mentioned is the game is a time trial it needs an explicit “Start” button. Also stop the timer when user is not playing e.g. reading the rules.- There’s no point of having a “Play again” option for a Wordle style daily game, the thinking part is already done, so any replay is just an exercise in dexterity.- It’s okay to be US-centric actually, doesn’t matter unless you are very serious about monetizing it, and even then being US-centric will work.- Consider showing rules for first time users before staring the puzzle.- Consider having some sort of overarching thing in your puzzle, so it’s not just five words on a specific topic to guess, but something more, like a hidden word across all five etc. This makes a delightful discovery moment and sometimes might work as a clue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On an older iPad I get "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading www.whatsit.today (see the browser console for more information)." neatly centred on an otherwise blank page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One small piece of feedback: typically these games do not allow proper nouns, because there’s too many of them. So having “Catan” be a valid word is pretty awful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593789</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a pivotal episode of "This American Life" that significantly impacted host Ira Glass and the show's direction. It highlights the theme and content of the episode, exploring how it reshaped storytelling techniques and audience engagement. Glass reflects on the challenges faced during production and the subsequent influence this particular installment had on both the radio show and his career. The piece underscores the transformative power of media and personal storytelling in fostering connection and understanding among listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

adequately to allege actual malice.”The “not statements of fact” included the reassurances that Carlson always made, in this case he said “Remember the facts of the case. These are undisputed” followed by clearly disputed and false claims.The lawyers argued successfully that it should be clear to the viewer that what Carlson says “cannot reasonably be interpreted as fact” even when he says that these are the facts.Arguably the bigger factor was proving malice, and Carlson seems very careful not to put anything into an email or text that undermines what he says on air.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-yor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes this fascinating isn't just what it says about storytelling, but what it reveals about our relationship with truth in media. I worked in public radio for 7 years, and TAL's influence was impossible to overstate - every producer wanted to craft stories with that perfect narrative arc.The Daisey episode still haunts journalism programs. We used it as a case study in our ethics workshops. The truly unsettling part wasn't just Daisey's fabrications, but how perfectly those lies fit into TAL's storytelling template - dramatic scenes, sympathetic characters, narrative tension, and a tidy resolution that makes you feel something.Glass wasn't wrong about storytelling's power to make people listen. But the Daisey incident showed its dangers - when your format rewards emotional impact and narrative elegance, you create incentives for sources to deliver exactly that, truthful or not.The saddest part is that real stories about Foxconn's labor conditions existed that could have been told without fabrication. But they wouldn't have had that perfect "old man touching an iPad for the first time" moment that makes for such a perfect radio beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43549893</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a proposal for integrating WebAssembly (Wasm) support into the Swift programming language. It outlines the potential benefits of allowing Swift developers to compile their code to Wasm, which would enable the creation of high-performance web applications and improve code sharing across platforms. The discussion includes technical considerations, possible use cases, and the importance of community feedback, encouraging Swift developers to share their thoughts and contribute to the vision for this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting proposal though it does sound a bit too general. “Improve cross compilation”… current Swift tools are barely keeping it together for the “happy path” of building for Apple devices (it’s not that happy). It would be cool to expand into wasm/wasi as long as it doesn’t come at the expense of other desperately needed improvements.Rust, Go and others have been building WASM 0.2 support for many years, they currently have a “just works” support for WASI. It would be a long time until Swift is even remotely ready for something like this and I don’t feel there is a burning need to have “yet another wasm platform”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we have a proper Windows support? i.e. with all the batteries/libraries included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopefully they make interface types available to the runtime. So you can read/write wasm struct properties from the host without all the usual glue code cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593596</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had one as a friend-pet for a while a few years ago. We went outside one day and found one leaf in our plum tree was tube-shaped with some spiderweb and after some waiting, off  she came (I have no idea if it was male or female but Spanish is a gendered language and spiders are female, so we always referred to it as “her”).Every day around noon she’d come out of her leave and wait to catch an insect. It was amazing to see her precisely jump to get it, and watching her eat was a mix of gross and interesting. I normally dislike spiders (though I don’t kill them unless I really feel threatened) but jumping spiders are an exception and I’d actually describe them as nice, almost pet/friend material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jumping spiders make great pets. The ones I've kept build silk tubes in the upper corners of their terrariums to hide and sleep in, meaning I could see them most of the time. They actively hunt, which is fun to watch. And even the common phidippus audax has bright coloring.  They only live a year or two, but it's cool to watch them grow.Beyond the facts in this article, jumping spiders have also shown spatial reasoning. When they see prey on another leaf behind their jumping range, they'll climb down and find a path to the prey's leaf, even if the prey isn't visible during this detour. They remember it's relative location and seemingly "choose" the best route to get there.Edit: You can also "hand feed" your jumping spider with a cotton swab dipped in sugar water. They drink flower nectar in the wild, so my wife and I tried this and it worked!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;jumping spiders are very cool but god this site sucks to use on mobile. 3

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a detailed overview of a tagless final approach to implementing programming languages in Haskell. It explains how this method enables the construction of interpreters and compilers by representing language constructs as Haskell types and functions, maintaining type safety and modularity. The author discusses the advantages of tagless final over traditional approaches, such as improved composability and ease of extension for programming languages. Additionally, the article provides examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts, aiming to help readers understand the practical applications of the tagless final style in developing language abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just got over writing 2 (well 2.5) toy compilers and I think a lot of the material in the compiler-teaching space lack some subtle developmental aspects.I wish there was a course designed somewhere which talked about more ingrained issues: how to structure/design the AST[0], buffer based vs noncontextual tokenization/parser design, index handling and error sync in the parser, supporting multiple codegen architectures, handling FFI, exposing the compiler as an API for external tooling, namespaces and linkage handling etc. etc. etc.It is refreshing to see how Carbon designed some of its components (majorly the frontend, yet to take a look at the backend) as it touches on some of the subtleties I mentioned. If someone is starting out on writing one, I would recommend taking a look at it or any of the talks.Always nice to see new material coming up. A few resources that I would like to mention would be dabaez's compiler course, Khoury college's compiler course (in Rust, previously i think and Ocaml), Nora Sandler's book as well as http://compilerbook.org; Which I consider to be the best guide out there for writing small learning compilers, the videos are good as well.[0]: Some related content that I enjoyed reading: https://lesleylai.info/en/ast-in-cpp-part-1-variant/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The notes reference:    "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction"
    Abdulaziz Ghuloum
    http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf

Can't recommend it enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another text using this approach:https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047760/essentials-of-compila... - Jeremy Siek's Essentials of Compilation (there's also a Python version)Admittedly I didn't finish working through it (life got in the way), but I worked through a good chunk of it with a colleague from a non-CS background. He wanted to understand compilers and it seemed to be much more effective than other texts he'd tried to work through. I'll have to look at this one at some point, probably this summer when things are usually calmer for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593088</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's crazy that this post seems to have stumbled across an equivalent to the Copy-and-Patch technique[0] used to create a Lua interpreter faster than LuaJit[1][0]: https://sillycross.github.io/2023/05/12/2023-05-12/
[1]: https://sillycross.github.io/2022/11/22/2022-11-22/The major difference is that LuaJIT Remake's Copy-and-Patch requires "manually" copying blocks of assembly code and patching values, while this post relies on the Go compiler's closures to create copies of the functions with runtime-known values.I think there's fascinating processing being made in this area—I think in the future this technique (in some form) will be the go-to way to create new interpreted languages, and AST interpreters, switch-based bytecode VMs, and JIT compilation will be things of the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiling an expression to a tree of closures, and a list of statements to a slice of closures, is exactly how I optimized [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro)  my Go interpreter written in go.There are more tricks available there, as for example unrolling the loop that calls the list of closures, and having a `nop` closure that is executed when there's nothing to run but execution is not yet at the end of the the unrolled loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiling queries is one of those things that is both Make it Right and Make it Fast.Because bind variables and Prepared Statements go hand in hand, you want to do everything you can to coax your users into doing the right thing. If each unique query has to be compiled before first use, that’s an extra inducement to using prepared statements properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595283</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dumb question, but if register contention deadlock is possible, what would stop the shaders or hardware from, say, detecting the deadlock and spilling one or more threads to local memory?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I would have expected the request for additional registers to be linked into the resource request scoreboarding you see for texture accesses, rt hardware requests, etc.  Busy waiting on condition code seems non optimal, and opening the window for cases where one or all shader programs on core can no longer make progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a really good trick. New to me. Anyone know a reasonable way to do the query equivalent? Not allocate more, ask how many are currently available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595223</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive visualization of the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm, which is used for rendering lines in computer graphics. Users can manipulate parameters to see how the algorithm calculates pixel positions in real-time, demonstrating the step-by-step process of line drawing. This educational tool aims to enhance understanding of the DDA algorithm and its application in graphical applications. Through user interaction, visitors can grasp the concepts of graphics rendering more intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Original author here. I've been reading this website for years. Imagine my shock when I saw my own article on the front page! I'm glad people are enjoying it.Quick fact about the way the interactivity is done, all of the code for it is in this blogpost.js file: https://aaaa.sh/creatures/blogpost.js, which is only about 100 lines long. Each block has a list of scripts that it pulls from like so:&lt;div class="code-example" scripts="grid-sm 2d-vector-gfx-lib draw-grid full-algo-intro feather-canvas-edges"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and then there's a set of script tags with those ids. I figured it was a nice solution!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's incredible timing, I just spent 2 days trying to implement DDA from first principles for my wolfenstein-like game in C.Can't wait to see how you explain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, this is DDA, not Bresenham, for lines.An interesting point about Bresenham's algorithm is made by David Schmenk (dschmenk) on his "Bresen-Span" page:"Take note that the algorithm can be viewed as the long division of delta-major/delta-minor. The error term is really the running remainder, and every step results in a pixel along the major axis until the division completes with a remainder. The division restarts by moving along the minor axis and adding the dividend back in to the running remainder (error term). This is a bit of a simplification, but the concept is that the long division will only result in two integral spans of pixels, depending on the value of the running remainder (error term). We will take this in to account to write a routine that outputs spans based on the two span lengths: a short-span and a long-span."In other code, dschmenk does use DDA for anti-aliased lines.https://github.com/dschmenk/Bresen-Span&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543007</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Loader's number is a large number defined in the context of computability theory and is named after the mathematician John Loader. It is an example of a number that arises in discussions related to the hierarchy of large numbers and sets. The article discusses its properties, background, and significance in mathematical and computational settings. It also explores its relation to other large numbers, its calculation, and the implications of its size in theoretical mathematics. Overall, Loader's number serves as a fascinating example of the complexities involved in large number theory and its relevance to various fields within mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines ten essential rules for successfully negotiating a job offer. Key points include understanding your worth and doing market research to set realistic salary expectations, maintaining a positive and collaborative attitude during negotiations, and being prepared to articulate your unique skills and value to the organization. It emphasizes the importance of considering the entire compensation package, including benefits and work-life balance, rather than focusing solely on salary. Additionally, the author advises on the significance of being patient and willing to walk away if the offer does not meet your needs. Overall, the rules are designed to empower job seekers to advocate effectively for themselves while fostering a constructive dialogue with potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a company I've interviewed with, I've been asked twice a salary range and declined both times. I was even transparent for the 2nd time (which happened months later) and answered that it's not in my interest to give a number first.Well, I received an offer from them and I would have undercut myself by 30%.This is perhaps—or perhaps not—an extreme example, but I only applied what I was told in the negotiation articles and books I've read.When you read a book, you're going to think "It's just fantasy; no way this is going to happen to me" but if you actually apply that knowledge it can truly work in your favor.I also declined an offer 2 months beforehand because the salary was ridiculously low, despite being unemployed at the time.Want is fine, need is not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the sentences at the very start caught my eye:&gt; I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation?There's a wealth of actionable negotiation advice if you know where to look, like Harvard Business Review and Harvard Law, First Round Review, among others.One of the big pieces on negotiation I got from Harvard[0], from their Program on Negotiation. I did not attend Harvard, but reading two or three of their articles a week goes a long way.--[0]: https://www.pon.harvard.edu/uncategorized/what-is-anchoring-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked for resources a few years ago and found a post by a software engineer talking about "Fearless Salary Negotiation" [1]. The engineer said: "it's a small book, cost me around 40 bucks which were immediately compensated by the fact that I managed to negotiate a higher salary".I wanted to ask for a raise: I had been working in that startup for 4 years and had never had a raise. I thought "if that book helps me get a raise of a few bucks per month, that will pay for it".It didn't go as planned: I followed the instructions in the book, my boss spent an hour bullshitting me and I didn't get a raise. So I sent my resignation the next day. The boss called me back, and I got a substantial raise and a bonus (to compensate for the shitty salary I had been having before, it was not a miracle).All that to say that this book did not make me a pro negotiator. But it made me understand how salary negotiation works (reading it, I felt like a child: it only says common sense stuff, but I had been doing everything wrong my whole life). And it gave me the confidence to actually ask for a raise.Totally worth it.[1]: https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596864</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You pretty much need to use markup (or control codes) for rich text. Take bold, italic, underline, strikeout: those four can, and are, used in nearly any combination. You would need one bit for each of them. You would need two bits to specify four levels of headings. If you don't allow for that, you are back to using markup. You would also need one bit to specify proportional/fixed width font, because that is a thing too. That remaining bit would have to be used for superscript, since superscripts are commonly used for footnotes and simple mathematical expressions.Okay, you can now create passable rich text documents for a limited (though common) range of purposes with that 8/24-bit breakdown that was suggested. But you may have noticed the author mentioned subscripts, which wasn't in my list. Well, it turns out that subscript and superscript have a terribly limited range of applications if you are specifying them per character: x^2^2 would be visually identical to x^22, and x^a_b would look different from x_b^a (with both presentations being nonsensical). The use of subscripts and superscripts in any technical applications would be severely limited. You need a much richer markup language to be truly expressive. So there really isn't much of a point in offering subscripts. Superscripts, sure, because they have a few non-technical uses.Yet the reality is that people want a much richer set of formatting options. At a minimum, they want to select fonts and font sizes. Some of the formatting options have semantics. I know I crammed four levels of headings in those eight bits, but that only makes sense in headings. It doesn't make sense to specify it per character. Then there are other common document elements, like tables. You can create decent tables using monospaced fonts, but that is limiting and would produce undesirable results in some cases (try displaying April 5^th sensibly, using a monospace font so that it won't affect the width of the columns). On top of that, you are ditching the concept of styles because that implies some sort of markup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The odd thing is, you can do quite some bold/italics/superscript in Unicode nowadays. Because, at least from the ASCII letter range, they have been used in symbolic ways in Mathematics, etc., and have been added to Unicode as symbols rather than bold variants of letters. For example:, !, !ᴴᵉˡˡᵒ, ᵂᵒʳˡᵈ!So, there's almost no bold/italic punctuation. And non-ASCII Unicode letters aren't "supported" this way either. But you can get quite far with "formatted" ASCII letters in Unicode, if you're so inclined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hah, I was about to criticise the text for far too lightly conflating markup and punctuation, just to see the afterword.I actually do think the author has a point, in that must solutions today are inelegant, I also don't think this is a problem which has a real elegant solution. Where to draw the line? Why not encode fonts into the standard too, if we're doing bold? Etc.I'm still mostly in favour of keeping everything markdown (in my own writing), however much it pollutes the "purity" of text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562894</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every web server claims to be fast, so I wonder how they define that. As someone who has written their own supposedly fast web server I only want configuration simplicity. Most web servers are unnecessarily far too complicated.In a web server here is what I am looking for:* Fast. That is just a matter of streams and pipes. More on this later. That said the language the web server is written in largely irrelevant to its real world performance so long as it can execute low level streams and pipes.* HTTP and WebSocket support. Ideally a web server will support both on the same port. It’s not challenging because you just have to examine the first incoming payload on the connection.* Security. This does not have to be complicated. Let the server administrator define their own security rules and just execute those rules on incoming connections. For everything that fails just destroy the connection. Don’t send any response.* Proxy/reverse proxy support. This is more simple than it sounds. It’s just a pipe to another local existing stream or piping to a new stream opened to a specified location. If authentication is required it can be the same authentication that sits behind the regular 403 HTTP response. The direction of the proxy is just a matter of who pipes to who.* TLS with and without certificate trust. I HATE certificates with extreme anger, especially for localhost connections. A good web server will account for that anger.* File system support. Reading from the file system for a specific resource by name should be a low level stream via file descriptor piped back to the response. If this specific file system resource is something internally required by the application, like a default homepage it should be read only once and then forever fetched from memory by variable name. Displaying file system resources, like a directory listing, doesn’t have to be slow or primitive or brittle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/errantmind/faf is the fastest Rust static "web server" per the most recent TechEmpower Round 23 (Plaintext); it is purposely barebones (provide content via Rust callback!) The top 3 Composite scores are all Rust web frameworks, also not necessarily intended as general-purpose web servers.https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server wins the SEO (and GitHub star) battle, though apparently it is old enough to have a couple unmaintained dependencies.I use https://github.com/sigoden/dufs as my personal file transfer Swiss Army knife since it natively supports file uploads; I will check out Ferron as a lighter reverse proxy with automatic SSL certs vs. Caddy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really good Caddy replacement. The configuration format Caddy uses sometimes feels oversimplified in that complex configurations are hard to read. My instincts tell me this could scale better without getting more verbose. I'm definitely considering a migration if this project matures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555249</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Python's CPU caching mechanisms, specifically focusing on how caching improves performance for applications by reducing computation time and memory access. It explains the concept of cache memory within CPU architectures and its relevance to Python programming, highlighting strategies to effectively utilize caching in Python projects. Additionally, it presents practical examples and performance benchmarks to illustrate the benefits of implementing caching techniques in order to optimize code execution and resource management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IME CPU caches can be observed in almost all languages, regardless of how detached they are from the machine. What I'm really wondering is, if branch prediction can be observed from interpreted code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mechanical sympathy" effects are so strong on modern CPUs you feel them even in languages like Python that are far from the metal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't see why you wouldn't expect to find cache-sensitivity in Python, or in some other similarly high-level language.Python sequences are defined as "support[ing] efficient element access using integer indices" [1]. Python lists are sequences and thus must support random access. In practice that means the implementation is a (dynamically resizing) array allocated contiguously. That means spatial locality is relevant.If the list type were defined simply as an iterable collection, with no requirement of constant-time random access, the definition would be abstract enough that an implementation might end up being something else than a contiguous array. But if you define the type so that it supports constant-time random access [2], you pretty much end up with cache-friendly sequential access as well.If you don't define the list type as supporting random access, you also sacrifice asymptotic algorithmic efficiency for lookups by index. Any language that cares about efficiency at all separates collections that support efficient random access from those that don't. (For example, Python has lists and dicts/sets for different access patterns. The Java standard library has separate types for contiguous arrays/lists, hashtable-backed collections and tree-backed collections because the three have different algorithmic efficiencies for different access patterns. In practice it leads to different properties in terms of cache-friendliness as well.)[1] https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence[2] As usual, the Python documentation is a bit vague on the details. It doesn't really say random access has to be constant-time, only that it has to be "efficient". So you might be able to have a non-constant time implementation such as an indexable skiplist while arguing that it's efficient, but you'd have to go out of your way to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555110</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you stress test small address ranges around each failing address, does that selectively heat up the chip to which that address routes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, the reason the address-&gt;IC mapping is non-trivial is for performance reasons.If you were, for example, iterating over a column of a 2D array with a stride equal to some power of two, you'd end up hitting the same IC repeatedly. This limits your bandwidth to that of a single IC, rather than balancing it over all of them. (I'm simplifying a little, but that's the gist)So they try to "swizzle" things, using a formula like the one in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not loading for me, but here's the archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20250207044221/https://blog.pier...On 80's arcade games and home computers you can try piggybacking a known working RAM chip onto each of the RAMs for a quick diagnosis, if you're lucky (it doesn't always work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43554789</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For python apps (whether we should use python for apps is another question completely) my preferred config language is python.A little config.py file gets imported by everything in the project. It contains nothing but assignments to config variables. No functions. Nothing dragged in from a file. Just variable assignments.It's easy to understand, easy to update, and everyone understands this much python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This ("the rule of least power") is a rule I abide by religiously:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_powerI build lots of DSLs/configuration languages but Im pretty militant about killing them if requirements dictate a need for anything resembling loops or conditionals. Those are the the klaxon warning bells telling you that you should just be writing code/a library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tend to do a lot of data-oriented programming, including at the meta-programming level, which blends with the problem of configuration. A pattern I found that works well this use case and covers the whole clock is the following:- DSL as functions T, args* -&gt; T, where T is your configuration type — or, as I like to call it, a plan. Since under function composition it's insensitive to composition order (associativity of the monoid), you can layer DSL functions on top of each other freely.- Literal values as implicit functions. Once the plan is built and before it is run/compiled/interpreted, I cast any literal value in the datatype to a function returning that value. It's a design principle that allows me to hard-code behavior when a literal value is not enough by just swapping it with a lambda.- Once this kind of homogeneity is ensured, and given the points above, I can extend my DSL and the behavior it describes with point-free function combinators. I get conditionals, advanced composition (parallelism for instance) , instrumentation (debugging), etc... without burdening my DSL with ad-hoc, invasive implementations. More importantly I can reuse these facilities across DSLs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555760</guid></item><item><title>32.

There is some font magic to render {30,60} as small bars in the text.Nice, but the terms were new to me.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the alarming conditions in El Salvador's prisons, highlighting the government's harsh measures against crime, including mass incarcerations under President Nayib Bukele's administration. It warns American visitors about the potential dangers of traveling to El Salvador, particularly in light of Trump's historical comments about the country. The piece critiques the implications of such policies on human rights and emphasizes the broader impact of gang violence and governmental responses on society. The author calls for awareness regarding the harsh realities of life in El Salvador's prison system, contrasting it with perceptions in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heh, even the extrajudicial imprisonment camps can be outsourced now. Why look bad having your military run Guantanamo when you can do the Uber model it for a cheap price.Heh, or is a pun on AirBnB the more apt name for it.. "Concrete Floor &amp; Indefinite Detention"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across this article[1] the other day, after reading about the US sending people to a prison in El Salvador and wondering what we actually know about the place.An incongruity that I didn't notice at the time but realized a bit later is that the prison is called "The Center for Terrorism Confinement" and it has a capacity of 40,000 people.  Why would El Salvador or any country need a terrorist detention facility that holds 40,000 people?According to wikipedia, El Salvador has a population of about 6 million.The United States famously kept people accused of terrorism charges at Guantanamo Bay, and 780 prisoners have been kept there over the last couple decades since GWB established the prison.  There are currently 15.Presumably there are a lot more people who would fit the description "domestic terrorist" being held in jails in mainland US, but certainly not 40,000 of them.Presumably president Bukele's administration is using it as a detention facility for regular criminals as well, but it wouldn't be surprising if there's a lot of people there that shouldn't be in jail in the first place.[1] https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/americas/el-salvador-prison-t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point you have a better chance of being freed from this prison camp being a citizen of any other nation than the US which is sending people there without giving them a chance to prove that they are innocent or a citizen of the United States.At least another nation will do whatever they can to get you home unlike the US that just doesn't care. "We made a mistake but we don't care. Nothing we can do." Truly abhorrent especially when the US can do so much to get someone if they really want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43588970</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know the craziest thing about watching this as an outsider in Canada is that we as a nation are losing one reliable trading partner (and obviously losing an ally but that's another conversation). Germany - losing a trade partner. Japan? And so on. But the US has lost 180 reliable trading partners. You're already seeing in the first week burgeoning trade alliances between nations who wouldn't have cooperated before, and the amount of resentment against America from this is going to take a generation to heal.Of course I'm sure some people would claim this is 4D chess or what not but.. sometimes the person doing something crazy is just crazy at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was looking at used cars on Carmax about two or three weeks ago. I looked again today. They're another $1-2k.This is the shareholder/political class trying to eat their cake and have it too. Pay people a stagnant wage for 40 years while taking most of the surplus value and dedicating it to equities, then pretend to do something about it, but in a way that passes the buck to the people who have been making a stagnant wage so that the wealthy don't incur actual losses.Share prices will be brought back up through layoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not going to comment on the politics, but I'd point out that recession odds on Kalshi are currently 64% and 58% on Polymarket [1,2].  In other words, recession in 2025 is more likely than not -- though far from guaranteed.My thought relevant to HN is that either way this is likely to decimate venture capital and startups, at least in the short run.  Venture capital funds come from limited partners like pensions and endowments, and the professionals I know are all shifting away from growth stocks and into value, international and bonds.  VC is already in a drought (except for AI) and now my guess is that it's going to get worse.  So many VCs I know have started only in the last 15 years, so they have never seen a real recession like 2009 while working in venture.[1] https://kalshi.com/markets/kxrecssnber/recession[2] https://polymarket.com/event/us-recession-in-2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589231</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major carriers are increasingly hostile to SMS that don't originate from one of their customers' handset.Killing off this gateway cuts off an avenue of escape that  people might use to avoid TCR.If you haven't heard of TCR, you should check it out because it is negatively impacting you somewhere.Overseen by TMobile, The Campaign Registry is a pay-to-play scheme that applies to everyone who wants to send SMS to a ATT/TM/Vz user.To onboard with TCR, applicants have to:    1) pay up front and pay more and then pay forever 
    2) jump thru needlessly complicated hoops (that become ever-moving goalposts for small biz and end users).
    3) wait weeks-&gt;months then GOTO 2 again. And again.

The end result is more and more biz, MNVOs, orgs, etc are abandoning SMS. Trying to comply with TCR is too big a resource-sink for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're looking for a way to programmatically get messages to your phone I recommend Pushover. It's reasonably priced ($5 one time purchase for individuals) and it's run by a solo dev.https://pushover.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, yikes. I’ve come to rely on the email-&gt;sms gateway from AT&amp;T. I’ve had they set up a s a forwarding address within my web mail for a few years now, and have filters which forward matching messages as SMS to my phone.The formatting is often quite lousy but it’s enough to send me a nudge to check my email for a message from the library, a job I applied for, or whatever.I wouldn’t have heard about this about it being posted here, so thank you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589523</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built something similar a few years ago, but using a Pi instead of an Arduino. Reading through the poster's calculations brought back memories of debugging my own orbital mechanics code at 2am while questioning all my life choices.What impresses me most here isn't just the technical achievement, but how the project transforms abstract data into physical movement. We've become so accustomed to viewing everything through screens that there's something deeply satisfying about a physical object that silently points to a spacecraft traveling 28,000 km/h overhead with humans inside.The mathematical transformation from TLE to actual motor positioning is non-trivial - converting between reference frames always seems straightforward on paper until you're debugging at 3am wondering why your arrow is pointing at the ground. I appreciate that they shared actual code rather than glossing over the hard parts.For anyone wanting to build this: from my experience, the hardest part is actually the mechanical design. Getting smooth movement without backlash in consumer-grade steppers and servos takes patience. The 28BYJ-48 is a good budget choice but has noticeable "slop" in its gearing, which can make precise pointing challenging.This reminds me of those old mechanical orreries that modeled the solar system. There's something profoundly human about building machines that help us comprehend the cosmos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering the degree to which an equatorial mount would have simplified the code (made more complex the set-up of the mount).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool! TIL that pencil lead can be a lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593956</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the book discuss capacitive vs resistive touchscreens?At the time you basically had two choices for touchscreens: resistive or capacitive.   Resistive was "obviously" the way to go because it was far more accurate.   Choosing capacitive was inspired -- when used with stubby fingers the accuracy problem was moot, and it allowed multi-touch.Just before the iPhone came out I was fairly confident I knew what the future was.   It was now possible to create a phone with the horsepower to run a real web browsers.  800x600 pixel screens were available which would display normal web pages nicely, and a resistive touch screen with a stylus would make them useful.Then the iPhone came out.  320x480 screen meant normal web pages wouldn't display properly, inaccurate touchscreen meant tap targets needed to be increased massively.    Why would anybody buy an iPhone which didn't allow you to install apps, and the web was unusable because it required rewriting every page since existing pages were unusable.   Instead you could buy a phone which allowed you to install apps and which allowed you to usably access the web.   Obviously the iPhone would be a failure.  :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty similar to the Japanese "flick" keyboard that's fairly commonly used on smartphones. Instead of 3 possible directions per button there's 5 (up, left, right, down, and neutral): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5UEsHEZWIIIt's pretty intuitive because Japanese kana is a syllabary that's organized by their starting consonant and one of five possible vowels in the Gojuon system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABonI never got used to it but people who use it swear by it. Google even made a mechanical version for an April Fools a few years back: https://youtu.be/5LI1PysAlkU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, i always think "i wish there was a demo" of each iterative step on these kind of design journeys. And especially the iOS keyboard, as i thought a lot about it. Awesome that you made this.I really like their idea to make the touch keyboard work well by increasing the (invisible) "padding" area for the key most likely to be typed next. So obvious in hindsight but demos like your's show part of the journey.There are rumors that in the beginning they tried the ipod wheel as the user input interface.While working on my device, that idea is super motivating. I know where i am headed and have done a lot of work and really got something very, very interesting already. But a few parts are yet not clear at all. But, i am definitely further than our "clickwheel" stage. Not yet at the "secret padding" stage for some input ideas, but still.In case you are free and interested to loosely talk about ideas or feedback you have for a very novel device (and interface), please let me know how to reach out. Just because you made this demo, i feel we'd get a long &amp; i can learn a lot from you. And this might be a very interesting challenge for someone like you. Anyway, great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595442</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observational bias is interesting.  For example, if you judge by the stars visible to the naked eye, you get a very different sense of the distribution of stellar masses than if you use a telescope, because no class M main sequence stars will be included (the brightest has apparent magnitude 6.7).  The intrinsically brightest stars, including many of the famously named ones, are visible to great distances and so are very overrepresented.The most spectacular form of observational bias could be the presence of life.  The planet we are on will always have life (because, we are here and we are life) regardless of how uncommon life actually is in the universe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43591866</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been following Voyager since the late 70s when my dad (who worked at Ames) would bring home printouts of the Jupiter images. This interview captures something profound about these missions that non-space folks often miss.The most striking part isn't the technical achievement of keeping 1970s hardware alive for half a century. It's the human infrastructure behind it - the institutional knowledge passed through generations of engineers like some ancient priesthood maintaining a temple.Think about it: We're teaching 2020s engineers to understand machine code written before MS-DOS existed, working with 50 year old documentation on yellowing paper, and bringing retirees back to decipher systems they built when Nixon was president.Our space exploration legacy is being maintained by the engineering equivalent of oral history. This is why we need consistent funding for these long-term missions - the value isn't just in the data, but in maintaining the unbroken chain of knowledge transfer that makes missions like this possible.The sticky notes on diagrams trying to revive a silent probe 15 billion miles away just broke me. This is humanity at its finest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time this topic comes up on HN, I always like to remind readers about the following:One of my favorite facts ever is that Voyager 1 contains something called the Voyager Golden Record [1]. It has the following quote written:This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.I get chills every time I think about this.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; silicaFor anyone else curious, it's from the hydrazine tank's rubber diaphragm. Tubes inside the thrusters, which direct fuel to the catalyst beds, had openings taken from 250 um diameter down to 35 um.[1]The 28" spherical tank[2] has a rubber hemisphere to separate hydrazine from pressurant (He? N?). The diaphragm is EDPM that's teflon and silica filled.[3] The silica particles are for (tensile?) strengthening. It has a leaching issue (discussed in [2] page17).PSI was a small SoCal company.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of a "fifth kind of optimization," which goes beyond traditional optimization strategies employed in various fields. It discusses how this new layer involves not just maximizing efficiency or effectiveness, but also encompasses ethical considerations, sustainability, and the impact of decisions on society and the environment. The author emphasizes the importance of integrating these broader values into optimization processes to create solutions that are not only effective but also socially responsible and sustainable for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every large scale cloud/SaaS software has been using parallelism for decades [well, almost two decades give or take]. Requests run in parallel on millions of servers and one server processes many requests in parallel.In that sort of setup the old school optimize one program by doing things in parallel is somewhat less relevant because everything by its nature is massively parallel and complex operations are often broken down into bits that all run in parallel. In that sort of environment over-parallelizing can actually be a pessimization because there is often some cost around breaking the work up to run in parallel and your little bit of this massively parallel system may have some fraction of resources anyways.Not to say there's no value in knowing "old school" parallelizing (including using SIMD or GPUs or whatnot) but for many types of applications that's not where I'd focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somehow his taxonomy of optimizations doesn't have a category for things like "unroll a loop", "fuse loops", "block your array accesses", "avoid false sharing", or "strength-reduce your operations".  He has a "use a better algorithm" category, but his example is switching from bubble sort to selection sort, which is a much more disruptive kind of change than such micro-optimizations, which are usually considered to be "the same algorithm".This is rather puzzling, given that he starts off with, "Premature optimisation might be the root of all evil, but", quoting Knuth, and in context, Knuth was primarily talking about precisely such micro-optimizations: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/356635.356640 p. 267 (p. 7/41)Specifically, the optimizations Knuth was exhibiting in that section of the paper are:- speeding up a sequential array search by copying the search key to an empty spot at the end of the array, so that the loop only requires one termination test (are keys equal?) rather than two (are keys equal? is index in bounds?), speeding it up on typical machines of the time by 50%;- unrolling that version of the loop 2× in a way that required gotos, speeding it up by a further 12%.None of the optimization techniques being applied there fit into any of Tratt’s categories!Now, I can't claim to be any sort of optimization expert, but I think these kinds of micro-optimizations are still important, though, as Knuth pointed out at the time, not for all code, and often the drawbacks are not worth it.  Sometimes compilers will save you.  The C compiler might unroll a loop for you, for example.  But often it won't, and it certainly isn't going to pull something like the sentinel trick, because it doesn't know you aren't reading the array in another thread.This sort of depends on what context you're working in; arguably if your hotspots are in Python, even (as Tratt says) in PyPy, you have bigger opportunities for optimization available than manually unrolling a loop to reduce loop termination tests.  But I've found that there's often something available in that sort of grungy tweaking; I've frequently been able to double the speed of Numpy code, for example, by specifying the output array for each Numpy operation, thus reducing the cache footprint.  The code looks like shit afterwards, sadly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s also ‘don’t do it’ ( just turn the whole thing off because it’s actually not needed ) and ‘use a better middleman’ ( os, compiler etc while not going lower level). In my experience these are very cheap and usually not looked at and most devs jump at the other 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555311</guid></item><item><title>43. 404s – gallery of error 404 page designs</title><link>https://www.404s.design/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various database protocols and their importance in ensuring efficient data management and integrity within distributed systems. It outlines different types of protocols, such as two-phase commit and consensus algorithms, explaining how they help in synchronizing transactions across multiple nodes to maintain consistency. The piece emphasizes the trade-offs between performance, reliability, and complexity, providing insights into the selection and implementation of appropriate protocols for specific application needs. Overall, the article serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the fundamental concepts and challenges associated with database protocols in modern applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title says Database Protocols, but the author writes only about MySQL and Postgres. There are other databases out there, for example Oracle that I’m the most familiar with and it has had a break/reset mechanism built in to its protocol for at least 30 years [1]. Its a 2 step operation (2 roundtrips), one sending an error back to the client instead of the expected result and the second step will reset “current call” (not current session or connection) state on the server side and then request the client do the same.Databases/protocols that differentiate between connection, session and call scopes, can reliably perform resets without requiring to tear down the entire connection.Retrying is safe with no client side transaction idempotency tokens needed, as the error handling will roll back any changes done only by the failed call, not the entire transaction or session.[1]: https://tanelpoder.com/2008/04/10/sqlnet-breakreset-to-clien...Edit: added the comment about retry and idempotency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postgres does have "reset" support.There are several ways commands depending on what you want to reset. If you're only interested in mutable state changeable with SET, you can use RESET ALL instead. This resets configuration settings such as the time zone, statement timeout, and so on.Postgres has different fine-grained ways to reset other aspects of a session, such as closing cursors (CLOSE ALL), unlistening from notifications (UNLISTEN), deallocating prepared plans (DEALLOCATE), and so on. Finally, there's DISCARD ALL, which resets everything.I agree about error handling. Most clients just disconnect on a connection error.One gotcha about Postgres queries is that running queries do not get cancelled when the client disconnects. This has always been a weird one that's quite dangerous, as it can lead to dog-piling — if a client starts a slow query, then times out or cancels its connection, the query lives on; then if another identical request starts, same thing happens, and soon you have 100 queries running that are doing the same thing and getting slower and slower. You have to be very careful with retrying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most these issues seem specific to, and created by, the impedance mismatch between ORMs (like ActiveRecord) and databases.To work correctly, application code must be aware of transactions, and be prepared to roll back state and safely retry a transaction on failure.ORMs like ActiveRecord struggle to do this because they attempt to present a transactional database as a low-friction, in-memory, mutable, non-transactional data model that does not support rollback.If you lose a connection to the database prior to successfully committing your transaction, this is just another form of transaction failure.You need to discard any pending application state changes, open a new connection and transaction, requery data required to determine the actual current state, and then if necessary, retry your transaction.ActiveRecord can’t do that, hence the ill-advised desire to be able to automatically retry statements on failure — which abandons database-mediated transaction isolation, and incorrectly shifts responsibility for database state preservation/management to the client.If SQL was trivially idempotent, we wouldn’t need transactions or different levels of transaction isolation in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593547</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Soul of an Old Machine" explores the emotional and nostalgic connections people have with vintage technology, particularly old computers and devices. It delves into how these machines are often viewed not just as tools, but as carriers of memories and experiences, reflecting the intersection of humanity and technology. The piece also discusses the cultural significance of reviving and maintaining these machines, highlighting the artistry and craftsmanship involved in their design and the stories they tell about past eras.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite anecdote from Soul of a New Machine is about Josh Rosen, who designed the MV8000's arithmetic block.  According to the story, after troubleshooting various timing and layout issues he left a note on his terminal:  "I'm going to a commune in Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite books by my favorite author. Tracy Kidder gets to the heart of everyone he profiles like no other. Strongly recommend his book House if you like Soul of a New Machine.Funny anecdote: I've read Soul of a new machine many times over the years, and love it dearly. I stayed with my aunt and uncle last year and somehow the topic of mini computers came up. I mentioned Soul of a New Machine and my uncle said "oh yeah I worked on that computer." I was blown away. Apparently he had worked at Data General and he was on the software team (which is briefly mentioned towards the end of the book) that wrote the software the Eagle was released with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love books about writing/creating new software/hardware. One I can recommend, about Windows NT is: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Windows-Gene...Does anyone here know about any book(s) on the VAX, or indeed on any of DEC's machines, or IBM's stuff (which were - probably still are - beautifully engineered) come to that? I'm aware of "Big Blue", but that is mostly about IBM business practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555474</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses operational security (opsec) considerations for travelers crossing borders with cell phones. It emphasizes the importance of protecting personal data and mitigating risks of surveillance or data theft. Key recommendations include minimizing sensitive data on devices, using strong passwords, enabling encryption, and being cautious about disclosing information to border authorities. The author highlights that while it’s legal for authorities to inspect devices, travelers should be aware of their rights and take proactive measures to safeguard their information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GrapheneOS offers good OPSEC against Cellebrite: https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/14344-cellebrite-premium-ju...This comment, at the end of the thread, is particularly interesting:My Pixel 6 was confiscated by the German police after a political rally. I was recently able to pick it up again. From an inquiry with my lawyer, the following emerged: The authorities tried to read the device with both UFED4PC and Cellebrite Premium Touch. In addition, software from other forensic providers was used without success. The software did not succeed in breaking the system. The device was in BFU mode and had a 30-digit PIN. USB port was deactivated. As of March 2025, I can therefore say that it is not possible for Cellebrite to break a secured GrapheneOS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a modern iPhone and don’t want the crazy hacks, a very very simple but effective tip is to power off your iPhone when exiting the aircraft. When the device powers up it is in “before first unlock” mode and is severely restricted in what it can do. The attack surface area is significantly reduced. They’re not going to burn one of their $100,000 per install exploits on your BFU phone the same way they do with a full physical access unlocked paid exploit.Also lockdown mode to reduce attack surface area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of article makes me sad, as why should we live in a world where we (or at least some people) need to even think about this.. maybe I woke up this morning in a foul mood, but honestly, the idea of even having to think about burner phones and "opsec" for traveling (or even just living) depresses me to the point where I will probably not do it at all, and if things go sour, I just accept my fate. Similar to the prepping advice currently given by the scaremongering news in the EU... (Have water, and an emergency radio!!).Anyone else feel like this? I simply do not have any desire to live in a world where this kind of behavior is required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555597</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As LLMs do things thought to be impossible before, LeCun adjusts his statements about LLMs, but at the same time his credibility goes lower and lower. He started saying that LLMs were just predicting words using a probabilistic model, like a better Markov Chain, basically. It was already pretty clear that this was not the case as even GPT3 could do summarization well enough, and there is no probabilistic link between the words of a text and the gist of the content, still he was saying that at the time of GPT3.5 I believe. Then he adjusted this vision when talking with Hinton publicly, saying "I don't deny there is more than just probabilistic thing...". He started saying: not longer just simply probabilistic but they can only regurgitate things they saw in the training set, often explicitly telling people that novel questions could NEVER solved by LLMs, with examples of prompts failing at the time he was saying that and so forth. Now reasoning models can solve problems they never saw, and o3 did huge progresses on ARC, so he adjusted again: for AGI we will need more. And so forth.So at this point it does not matter what you believe about LLMs: in general, to trust LeCun words is not a good idea. Add to this that LeCun is directing an AI lab that as the same point has the following huge issues:1. Weakest ever LLM among the big labs with similar resources (and smaller resources: DeepSeek).2. They say they are focusing on open source models, but the license is among the less open than the available open weight models.3. LLMs and in general all the new AI wave puts CNNs, a field where LeCun worked (but that didn't started himself) a lot more in perspective, and now it's just a chapter in a book that is composed mostly of other techniques.Btw, other researchers that were in the LeCun side, changed side recently, saying that now "is different" because of CoT, that is the symbolic reasoning they were blabling before. But CoT is stil regressive next token without any architectural change, so, no, they were wrong, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent talk:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bit of context regarding Project Gutenberg. Its intake process is far from casual. Take a look at Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders (PGDP, [0],[1]), one of the oldest "crowd-sourcing" projects on the net (est. 2000). As you can see from [0], every book goes through three rounds of proofing, where volunteers read each page of text and compare it to the scanned image; then through two rounds of format review, where other volunteers insert or review format markup.From that 5-pass process the marked-up text is handed to a volunteer "post-processor" who assembles the final HTML or e-book file; then the completed book gets one more "smooth reading" pass before it is posted to PG.This it the process that produces the books input to Standard Ebooks. That they can still find scanner errors ("tne" for "the", a typical "scanno") demonstrates how difficult it is to see those. But their presence isn't from carelessness or disregard for the value of the books.In the 20-teens I put in hundreds of volunteer hours at PGDP in all the above roles, and it was very satisfying work. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an online hobby that feels constructive. Volunteering time to Standard Ebooks would probably feel good as well.[0] https://www.pgdp.net/c/activity_hub.php[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Proofreaders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editor-in-chief here, happy to answer any questions, as always.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution and architectural design of the XNU kernel, which underlies Apple's Darwin operating system. It explores the historical context of its development, highlighting the integration of components from both FreeBSD and the Mach microkernel. The piece delves into key features of the XNU architecture, such as its hybrid kernel design, memory management, and support for various hardware platforms. It also examines the performance implications and benefits of this architecture in terms of efficiency and security, showcasing its significance within the broader landscape of operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What impresses me most about technical documentation like this is how it structures knowledge into comprehensible layers. This article manages to explain an extremely complex system by establishing clear relationships between components.I've been experimenting with similar approaches for documentation in open source projects, using knowledge graphs to link concepts and architectural decisions. The biggest challenge is always keeping documentation synchronized with evolving code.Has anyone found effective tools for maintaining this synchronization between documented architecture and implemented code? Large projects like Darwin must have established processes for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Mach’s virtual memory (VM) system was influential beyond the project – it was adopted by 4.4BSD and later FreeBSD as their memory management subsystem.…and NetBSD[0], OpenBSD[1], but apparently not DragonFly BSD[2].[0] https://netbsd.org/docs/kernel/uvm.html[1] https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.0/uvm.9[2] https://www.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2011-04/msg0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article states that "pager daemons" that manage swap files runs in user space, and the kernel memory can also get swapped out, but never explained how a user space daemon swaps out kernel memory. Do they have hard-coded exceptions for special daemons, or use special system calls? Where can I find out more details about the user space memory management specifically?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597778</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of security within the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) certification, emphasizing that security should be a core focus for IT professionals. It outlines the increasing demand for cybersecurity skills in the job market and argues that security knowledge is essential for maintaining system integrity and protecting sensitive data. The author advocates for more comprehensive training in security within the MCP framework to equip professionals with the necessary skills to address contemporary cybersecurity challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600192"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The post highlights and cites a few attack scenarios we originally described in a security note (tool poisoning, shadowing, MCP rug pull), published a few days ago [1]. I am the author of said blog post at Invariant Labs.Different from what many suspect, the security problem with MCP-style LLM tool calling is not in isolating different MCP server implementations. MCP server implementations that run locally should be vetted by the package manager you use to install them (remote MCP servers are actually harder to verify).Instead, the problem here is a special form of indirect prompt injection that you run into, when you use MCP in an agent system. Since the agent includes all installed MCP server specifications in the same context, one MCP server (that may be untrusted), can easily override and manipulate the agent's behavior with respect to another MCP server (e.g. one with access to your sensitive database). This is what we termed tool shadowing.Further, MCP's dynamic nature makes it possible for an MCP server to change its provided tool set at any point or for any specific user only. This means MCP servers can turn malicious at any point in time. Current MCP clients like Claude and Cursor, will not notify you about this change, which leaves agents and users vulnerable.For anyone, more interested, please have a look at our more detailed blog post at [1]. We have been working on agent security for a while now (both in research and now at Invariant).We have also released some code snippets for everyone to play with, including a tool poisoning attack on the popular WhatsApp MCP server [2].[1] https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool...[2] https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-injection-experiment...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These attacks are mostly just more examples of being on the wrong side of the airlock (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060508-22/?p=31...). None of these involve crossing a privilege boundary, they just found a weird way to do something they could already doAn MCP server is running code at user-level, it doesn't need to trick an AI into reading SSH keys, it can just....read the keys! The rest of these are the same complaints you can levy against basically any other developer tool / ecosystem like NPM or VS Code Extensions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a challenge: sketch a better design, that:1. Is properly secure, to whatever standards will stop people writing "S Stands for Security" articles, and2. Allows programs implementing it to provide the same set of features the most useful MCPs do now, without turning automatic functionality into one requiring manual user confirmations, and generally without defeating the purpose of the entire idea, and3. Doesn't involve locking everything down in a proprietary Marketplace with a corporate Gatekeeper.I'd be interested to see a proposal, because so far all I've seen is "MCP is not sekhure!!!111" in general and non-specific sense. I guess it's not that easy, especially when people forget that security and usefulness are opposing forces.(Also, AFAIK, MCP was not intended for its implementations to be hosted by third parties and provided "as a Service". If that cannot be secure, then don't do it. Find some other business to be in, instead of trying to nerf MCP through "solving" something that isn't a problem with the protocol.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600192</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of the order of configuration directives in OpenSSH's sshd_config file. It emphasizes that the sequence in which options are defined can significantly affect the behavior of the SSH server. The author provides examples to illustrate how certain settings can override others based on their placement, and highlights best practices for organizing configurations to avoid unexpected results. Ultimately, the piece serves as a guide for system administrators to improve their SSH setups by understanding and applying the correct order of configuration directives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Purpose of first-define is the rule: In placing configuration files higher than user-defined configuration but Only with SSH client, can want user to have control from their config files: Remove from config files Place a couple under Match/MatchGroup using deny/accept.SSHD (server/non-client) still support admin-defined by having system-wide settings done firstly.  For those who have multi-file SSHD configurations, breakdown of the many config file locations and scopes here as it covers default user,
system-wide,
specific user:https://egbert.net/blog/articles/ssh-openssh-options-ways.ht...Also I broken out each and every SSHD and SSH options along with their ordering by execution by using file name and numbering as well as its various state machine, dispatch, CLI equivalence, network context, and function nesting, all in:https://github.com/egberts/easy-admin/tree/main/490-net-sshhttps://github.com/egberts/easy-admin/blob/main/490-net-ssh/...Disclaimer: I do regular code reviews of OpenSSH and my employer authorizes me to release them (per se contract and NDA)Also this showed how to properly mix and match authentication types using OR and AND logic(s) inhttps://serverfault.com/a/996992It is my dump mess so wade 'em and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is perhaps old sysadmin knowledge, but different tools have very different heuristics about how they parse configuration, and you have to check every time and not assume. Among the consequences to not checking are gaping security holes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's why I erase sshd_config and put what I really meant there. You may say "but isn't it better to patch it properly?". It is not. Yet another vps hoster –&gt; yet another /etc/ssh directory template that may have all sorts of access issues in it. Better to replace it and make it do exactly what you have planned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573507</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this part interesting:&gt; González Waite said that all of the large proprietary software companies ""are big bullies"". He has been called into the US embassy and been threatened because Mexico was using technology that was not from the US; those threats were dialed back when he explained that the government also used software and services from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Various companies use the US government to bully other countries, but they also use license audits as a reaction to projects that move to open-source software. Every time a successful switch happened, ""six months later there was an audit""; having the right legal team helps defend against those tactics, he said.It matches also what I heard from someone working for the Dutch government. He said that whenever they needed a new software system, that Microsoft would send multiple consultants for "free" which all could "help" the transition to a new service from Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic network theory:"Economists who have studied the software industry concluded that the value of a software business is about equal to the total costs of its customers switching out to the competition; both are equal to the net present value of future payments from the customers to the software vendor. This means that an incumbent in a maturing market, such as Microsoft with its Office product, can grow faster than the market only if it can find ways to lock in its customers more tightly. There are some ifs and buts that hedge this theory around, but the basic idea is well known to software industry executives. This explains Bill G's comment that `We came at this thinking about music, but then we realized that e-mail and documents were far more interesting domains'."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article uses the phrase "no brainer" but then explains why it very much requires brainer when making IT decisions.License costs are a factor, yes, but they are not the only cost, and in most cases not the significant one.In some cases the offerings are similar enough that it moves the needle. PostgreSQL for example is a good candidate- Oracle is expensive, and the number of people interacting with it is limited. Plus the fundamentals of Oracle and PostgreSQL are more-or-less the same.On the other extreme the cost of training and support dwarfs the license cost. If all staff come with knowing how to use say Windows and Excel,but require training and support for say Linux Desktop and Libre Office, then the "free" thing costs more.It's no accident that OSS has done better on the backend than the front end.Success for OSS means putting the right product in the right place, taking all things (not just license cost) into account.(Aside: corruption is a red herring, corrupt officials and companies can be corrupt regardless of software license.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43579104</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is where remote work goes off the rails, but then it’s wild how intentionally isolating the implementation of RTO that many large corporations are doing now.They line people up in rows, put headphones on their heads and wire them up to Teams and Jira to spend the whole day in isolation. Because taking a walk to another floor of building to talk to someone like a normal human being is too wasteful, but somehow forcing everyone to spend hours commuting isn’t.It’s the worst of both worlds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An online application of this principle is Focusmate, where you schedule calls with essentially random strangers and just work together. There's very little chit chat and it's not some weird front for a hookup scheme. I've been amazed at how well it works for me. I can't really explain why, after all the other person can't see my screen so I could just be doom scrolling YouTube the whole time, but for some reason I don't. I don't use it all the time, but when I need to get something unappealing done I still use it. I've also used it for exercise, and I've had partners use it for all sorts of weird things that they had been procrastinating. I highly recommend it, I thought it would be far weirder than it turned out to be, and it's really useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I may have ADHD, I never went for a diagnosis and found body doubling useful at times, especially when I was in school some decades ago, back then I had no name for it. However, I find white noise very helpful with staying on the task and with increased focus. My company moved, about a year ago, into a very cramped office that is also extremely noisy.  This exasperated me, I would get drained of energy in a couple of hours and my focus was being severy affected. I even considered quitting and looking for something else. As a last resort I started listening to white noise. I’ve been using white noise (white+brown+pink) for about a year now and find that it helps not only with cancelling out the noise but with focus and staying on task in general. I even use it at home at times. I know this may not be useful for everybody but I’m sure it could help out some of you. I use https://noises.online/ and mix all the types of white noise at the same time for maximim coverage but any type of white noise generator would do. To me it feels like being close to a waterfall. At first my ears hurt a bit after a few hours of white noise but got used to it after a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597425</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage presents research on SeedLM, a machine learning model designed for compressing language models while maintaining their performance. It outlines the challenges associated with current large language models and how SeedLM addresses these issues through efficient parameterization and training methodologies. The research aims to enhance the deployment of language models in resource-constrained environments, making them more accessible and practical for various applications. Additionally, it discusses the technical details of the model's architecture and the implications for future advancements in machine learning and natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting trick, using a dictionary of basis vectors which are quickly computed from a seed without storage. But the result is the same 3 or 4 bit quantization, with only a slight improvement. Their tiles are small, just 8 or 12 weights, it's why compression doesn't go too far. It would have been great if this trick lowered quantization &lt;1 bit/weight, that would require longer tiles. Wondering what are the limits if we use a larger reservoir of cheap entropy as part of neural net architecture, even in training.Congrats to Apple and Meta, makes sense they did the research, this will go towards efficient serving of LLMs on phones. And it's very easy to implement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It sounds like they basically find part of a pseudo-random sequence that is closest to the desired data, then store the random seed and corrections (which are small so take less space).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it would be better to just link directly to the paper [1].

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intersection of blacksmithing and the programming language Lisp, highlighting the similarities in craftsmanship, creativity, and problem-solving required in both fields. It explores how blacksmiths, like programmers, must understand their materials and tools to create effective and elegant designs. The author reflects on the learning process and the importance of practice and experimentation in mastering both disciplines, drawing parallels between forging metal and coding. Ultimately, it emphasizes the art and science behind both blacksmithing and programming, celebrating the craftsmanship involved in each.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the author was talking about Lisp here, the approach should be applied to any language. Split the problem up into an abstraction that makes it look easy. Then dive in and make that abstraction, and ask yourself again what you’d need to make this level easy, and repeat.Sometimes it takes a lot of work to make some of those parts look and be easy.In the end, the whole thing looks easy, and your reward is someone auditing the code and saying that you work on a code base of moderate complexity and they’re not sure if you’re capable enough to do anything that isn’t simple.  But that’s the way it is sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The classic issue of who made the first tongs could be inserted here, with some hammering.(It's a classic legend. There is an Islamic legend that Allah gave the first pair of tongs to the first blacksmith because you need a pair of tongs to make a pair of tongs. There's a Nordic legend that Thor made the first tongs. In reality, somebody probably used a bent piece of green wood, which didn't last long, but could be easily replaced.)His piece "Vibe Coding, Final Word"[1] is relevant right now.[1] https://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/04/vibe-coding-final-word....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The truth is that when you tap softened tongs around a workpiece into shape, they turn into parentheses. That's what reminds you of Lisp, not the malleability explanation that you invented afterward.Lisp, Jazz, Aikido and (now) Blacksmithing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43566651</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the intriguing possibility that neutron stars, which are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars, may provide insights into the existence of an additional dimension beyond the familiar three. Researchers believe that the unique properties of neutron stars, especially their gravitational fields and behavior of matter under extreme conditions, could hint at the existence of hidden dimensions predicted by certain theories in physics, such as string theory. By studying the interactions and characteristics of these stars, scientists aim to deepen their understanding of fundamental forces and the fabric of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Gravity, the thinking goes, can escape our brane and extend into the bulk. That explains why it’s so weak. All the other forces must play in only three spatial dimensions, while gravity can extend itself out to four, spreading itself much too thin in the process.Wouldn't this cause gravitational force to fall off with distance using something other than an inverse-square law? I think this explanation would be a better fit for the weak force than gravity for this reason. Thoughts?More broadly: inverse-square behavior (Gravity, EM etc) strikes me as an intrinsic property of 3D geometry; more so of a tell of dimensionality than the magnitude of the force. (I believe the article is inferring higher dimensionality from relative magnitude, vice distance falloff)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants a super approachable lecture on Neutron stars, this was released just a couple of weeks ago - https://youtu.be/I12SQ7YOebY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Far from expert in the field, but assuming that gravity is acts in a 3+ND and we observe it in our 3D world, shouldn't we observe weird peculiarities with it rather that just its amplitude?Think that you live on a line, and you see projections of a 2d object doing circles on top of you. You would see the shade moving and changing sizes in a non-explainable manner to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600704</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of DuckDB and Apache Arrow to enhance web-based data analytics using WebAssembly (WASM). It explains how the author, motivated by the limitations of traditional data browsers, implemented a real-time data processing solution that leverages the efficiency of DuckDB for querying, along with Arrow's in-memory data format for fast data exchange. The use of web workers enables parallel processing, optimizing performance for web applications dealing with large datasets. The piece highlights the benefits of this approach in terms of speed, ease of implementation, and the potential for building more interactive and responsive data analysis tools in modern web environments.&lt;/p&gt;

Specially do not add fake editor UI and drop shadow to the image.In this case 25 lines of code is 50 kB of image binary.Also it cannot be searched via search engine. Nor can it be read with screen reader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use the WASM build of DuckDB quite extensively at Count (https://count.co - 2-3m queries per month). There are a couple of bugs we've noticed, but given that it's pretty much maintained by a single person seems impressively reliable!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [wasm] is executed in a stack-based virtual machine rather than as a native library code.Wasm's binary format is indeed a stack-based virtual machine, but that is not how it is executed. Optimizing VMs convert it to SSA form, basic blocks, and finally machine code, much the same as clang or gcc compile native library code.It is true that wasm has some overhead, but that is due to portability and sandboxing, not the stack-based binary format.&gt; On top of the above, memory available to WASM is limited by the browser (in case of Chrome, the limit is currently set at 4GB per tab).wasm64 solves this, by allowing 64-bit pointers and a lot more than 4GB of memory.The feature is already supported in Chrome and Firefox, but not everywhere else yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599613</guid></item><item><title>12.

Most of the time, vector tile servers are serving pre generated tiles, which is extremely fast. This analysis is about generating tiles on the fly from PostGIS through a custom web server.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've built a server for generating OpenStreetMap vector tiles on demand from a GeoDesk database, which is barely larger than an .osm.pbf (100GB vs. 80GB for current planet.osm.pbf) - much smaller than a PostGIS instance: https://github.com/styluslabs/geodesk-tiles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;another option that would have been interesting to see here is serving PostGIS GeoJSON export -&gt; tippecanoe encode. Tippecanoe is super fast, parallelizes well and built solely for generating vector tile data (with lots of configurable options that PostGIS lacks)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43598600</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest story in AI was released a few weeks ago but was given little attention: on the recent USAMO, SOTA models scored on average 5% (IIRC, it was some abysmal number). This is despite them supposedly having gotten 50%, 60% etc performance on IMO questions. This massively suggests AI models simply remember the past results, instead of actually solving these questions. I'm incredibly surprised no one mentions this, but it's ridiculous that these companies never tell us what (if any) efforts have been made to remove test data (IMO, ICPC, etc) from train data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The core point in this article is that the LLM wants to report _something_, and so it tends to exaggerate. It’s not very good at saying “no” or not as good as a programmer would hope.When you ask it a question, it tends to say yes.So while the LLM arms race is incrementally increasing benchmark scores, those improvements are illusory.The real challenge is that the LLM’s fundamentally want to seem agreeable, and that’s not improving. So even if the model gets an extra 5/100 math problems right, it feels about the same in a series of prompts which are more complicated than just a ChatGPT scenario.I would say the industry knows it’s missing a tool but doesn’t know what that tool is yet. Truly agentic performance is getting better (Cursor is amazing!) but it’s still evolving.I totally agree that the core benchmarks that matter should be ones which evaluate a model in agentic scenario, not just on the basis of individual responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a bit of a meta-comment, but reading through the responses to a post like this is really interesting because it demonstrates how our collective response to this stuff is (a) wildly divergent and (b) entirely anecdote-driven.I have my own opinions, but I can't really say that they're not also based on anecdotes and personal decision-making heuristics.But some of us are going to end up right and some of us are going to end up wrong and I'm really curious what features signal an ability to make "better choices" w/r/t AI, even if we don't know (or can't prove) what "better" is yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603453</guid></item><item><title>14.

It explains the key differences between `rsync` and `openrsync`, including how `openrsync` streamlines certain features and offers better handling of file transfer processes. Additionally, the author provides insights on how to adapt to this new utility, including command usage and potential issues users may encounter during the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the sparse documentation of openrsync does not create any confidence for me that it can be an acceptable substitute for rsync.In my opinion, any program that is supposed to copy files, but which is not able to make perfect copies, i.e. copies that do not lose any bit of data or metadata that was present in the original file, is just unusable garbage.Unfortunately, most copying programs available in UNIX-like operating systems (and also many archiving programs) do not make perfect file copies with their default options and many of them are never able to make perfect copies, regardless what options are used.I have not looked recently at the scp command of ssh, but at least until a few years ago it was not possible to make perfect file copies with scp, especially when the copies were done between different operating systems and file systems. That is why I never use scp, but only rsync over ssh.Rsync is the only program that I have seen, which is able (with the right options) to make perfect file copies even between different operating systems and file systems (for instance between FreeBSD with UFS and Linux with XFS), preserving also metadata like extended file attributes, access control lists and high-precision file timestamps (some copying programs and archiving programs truncate high-precision timestamps).The current documentation of openrsync does not make any guarantee that it can make complete file copies, so by default I assume that it cannot, so for now it is a program that I consider useless.Beside rsync for copying, one of the few Linux archiving programs that can archive perfect file copies is bsdtar (when using the pax file format; the ancient tar and cpio file formats cannot store all modern file metadata).(FYI: I always alias rsync to '/usr/bin/rsync --archive --xattrs --acls --hard-links --progress --rsh="ssh -p XXX -l YYYYYYY"')(With the right CLI options, "cp" from coreutils can make perfect file copies, but only if it has been compiled with appropriate options; some Linux distributions compile coreutils with wrong options, e.g. without extended file attributes support, in which case "cp" makes only partial file copies, without giving any warnings or errors.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a relatively new Linux user, I often find the "versioning" of bundled system utilities also to be a bit of a mess, for lack of a better word.A classic example, at least from my experience, is `unzip`. On two of my servers (one running Debian and the other an older Ubuntu), neither of their bundled `unzip` versions can handle AES-256 encrypted ZIP files. But apparently, according to some Stack Overflow posts, some distributions have updated theirs to support it.So here is what I ran into:1. I couldn't easily find an "updated" version of `unzip`, even though I assume it exists and is open source.2. To make things more confusing, they all claim to be "version 6.00", even though they obviously behave differently.3. Even if I did find the right version, I'm not sure if replacing the system-bundled one is safe or a good idea.So the end result is that some developer out there (probably volunteering their time) added a great feature to a widely used utility, and yet I still can’t use it. So in a sense, being a core system utility makes `unzip` harder to update than if it were just a third-party tool.I get that it's probably just as bad if not worse on Windows or macOS when it comes to system utilities. But I honestly expected Linux to handle this kind of thing better.(Please feel free to correct me if I’ve misunderstood anything or if there’s a better way to approach this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On one hand, it's a little annoying that openrsync doesn't support some features that rsync does.On the other hand, it's great that there are multiple independent implementations of rsync now. It means that it's actually being treated as a protocol, not just a piece of software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605003</guid></item><item><title>15.

It’s absurd that folks making policy, who have a potentially closer ear to the ground are not more restricted.The 30 days self reporting disclosure period is a joke too. It’s after the fact, has no real penalty for being late and AFAIK they don’t maintain any real restriction lists so it has no impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit uneducated in the ways of shorting options. Is this topical because Mr. President induced a massive stock market meltdown in the US and his friends could have made a fortune for knowing the details and shorted the most likely biggest loss-makers?Or is that not how the markets work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like the post title got the wrong “capital”, the name is Capitol (ie, the Capitol Building, where congresspeople work)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43604052</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The "model-signing" project on PyPI provides a Python package that facilitates the signing and verification of machine learning models to ensure their authenticity and integrity. It aims to enhance the security of deployed models by allowing developers to create secure signatures that confirm a model's source and have not been tampered with. The package is designed to be easy to use, enabling seamless integration into existing model deployment workflows and promoting trust in machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a solution looking for a problem. Can't you just share your model's hash when releasing it? This is exactly what happens when someone like Mistral share a magnet link to their model. It's just a hash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This lets you verify the signature on the model. It won’t help you tell that a decision came from that model. If you want to verify the inference that a model makes, check out https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl (our project).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Source: I have a relationship with OpenSSF but not directly involved. I'm involved in a "competing" standard.As other commenters pointed out this is "just" a signature. However, in the absence of standardised checks, this is a useful intermediate way of addressing the integrity issue around ML supply chain; FWIW today.Eventually, you want to move to more complete solutions that have more elaborate checks, e.g. provenance of data that went into the model, attested training. C2PA is trying to cover it.Inference time attestation (which some other commenters are pointing out) -- how can I verify that the response Y actually came from model F, on my data X, Y=F(X) -- is a strongly related but orthogonal problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious: does this fundamentally need to contain an actual model, or would it be okay if it generated a synthetic model itself, full of random weights? I’m picturing downloading just, say, a 20MB file instead of the multi-gigabyte one, and…Hang on, why is https://blob.localscore.ai/localscore-0.9.2 380MB? I remember llamafile being only a few megabytes. From https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases, looks like it steadily grew from adding support for GPUs on more platforms, up to 28.5MiB¹ in 0.8.12, and then rocketed up to 230MiB in 0.8.13:&gt; The llamafile executable size is increased from 30mb to 200mb by this release. This is caused by https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/7156. We're already employing some workarounds to minimize the impact of upstream development contributions on binary size, and we're aiming to find more in the near future.Ah, of course, CUDA. Honestly I might be more surprised that it’s only this big. That monstrosity will happily consume a dozen gigabytes of disk space.llamafile-0.9.0 was still 231MiB, then llamafile-0.9.1 was 391MiB, now llamafile-0.9.2 is 293MiB. Fluctuating all over the place, but growing a lot. And localscore-0.9.2 is 363MiB. Why 70MiB extra on top of llamafile-0.9.2? I’m curious, but not curious enough to investigate concretely.Well, this became a grumble about bloat, but I’d still like to know whether it would be feasible to ship a smaller localscore that would synthesise a suitable model, according to the size required, at runtime.—⁂—¹ Eww, GitHub is using the “MB” suffix for its file sizes, but they’re actually mebibytes (2²⁰ bytes, 1048576 bytes, MiB). I thought we’d basically settled on returning the M/mega- prefix to SI with its traditional 10⁶ definition, at least for file sizes, ten or fifteen years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been waiting for something like this. Have you considered the following based on the benchmark data that's submitted beyond the GPU?1. User selects a model, size and token output speed and latency. The website generates a hardware list of components that should match the performance requirements.2. User selects hardware components and the website generates a list of models that performant on that hardware.3. Monetize through affiliate links the components to fund the project. Think like PC part picker.I know there's going to be some variability in the benchmarks due to the software stack, but it should give a AI enthusiasts, an educated perspective on what hardware can be relevant for their use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributed scores for the M3 Ultra 512 GB unified memory: https://www.localscore.ai/accelerator/404Happy to test larger models that utilize the memory capacity if helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43572134</guid></item><item><title>18.

In fact, over the last couple years, I've come to take vulnerabilities with very high CVSS scores less seriously. Remember, Heartbleed was a "7.5".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's so dumb to assign it a CVSS score of 10.Unless you are blindly accepting parquet formatted files this really doesn't seem that bad.A vulnerability in parsing images, xml, json, html, css would be way more detrimental.I can't think of many services that accept parquet files directly. And of those usually you are calling it directly via a backend service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe the headline should note that this a parser vulnerability, not the format itself. I suppose that is obvious, but my first knee-jerk thought was, "Am I going to have to re-encode XXX piles of data?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603091</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses common issues that cause Windows computers to fail to sleep or wake properly, along with diagnostic steps and potential solutions. It emphasizes the importance of checking power settings, reviewing device driver updates, and investigating running background processes. The author provides practical tips for troubleshooting, including using the Command Prompt to manage power configuration settings and ensuring that devices aren't preventing sleep. The goal is to help users resolve sleep-related issues to enhance their computing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting sleep is an exercise wrapped in pain.Figuring out which program prevents sleeping is the easy part - there are tools that show that, and you can also usually just brute force it by killing programs one by one.Then comes figuring out why a system claims to be sleeping but isn't (e.g. the fan is still spinning). Usually this is because of the Modern Standby/S0 crap and in many cases there isn't a solution because the BIOS removed support for S3.The other class of issue is after sleeping the system won't wake up, or wake up randomly, or wake up with random glitchy graphics/sounds/etc.Sleep is easily Windows's most bug-ridden area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to say that I absolutely love these articles. Reading these kinds of investigations is like brain candy to me. I don't know why, but in my head, this falls into the same genre as a Sherlock Holmes novel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it's not a user-space, but a driver issue, I found powercfg /sleepstudy pretty helpful to determine why a W11 machine didn't enter or exited sleep too often, after the fact.On my laptop, this led me to discover that my Qualcomm X55 WAN is a real standby drain and that my Lenovo Thunderbolt dock really likes to disable its sleep mode after some big Windows updates, leading to a standby drain after the first time I plugged it in. I'm still surprised how many pitfalls there are with standby, even on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555365</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential pitfalls of using the Rust programming language, particularly its focus on safety and memory management. It highlights common misconceptions about Rust's safety guarantees, such as the belief that Rust completely eliminates all bugs or that developers can avoid the complexity that comes with its borrowing system. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these limitations to avoid becoming overly reliant on Rust's safety features. By acknowledging these challenges, developers can better navigate the language's complexities and write more effective code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is slightly misleading but the content is good. It's the "Safe Rust" in the title that's weird to me. These apply to Rust altogether, you don't avoid them by writing unsafe Rust code. They also aren't unique to Rust.A less baity title might be "Rust pitfalls: Runtime correctness beyond memory safety."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For integer overflows and array out of bounds I'm quite optimistic about Fluxhttps://github.com/flux-rs/fluxI haven't actually used it but I do have experience of refinement types / liquid types (don't ask me about the nomenclature) and IMO they occupy a very nice space just before you get to "proper" formal verification and having to deal with loop invariants and all of that complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it strange that the article doesn't talk about the alternative to checked arithmetic: explicit Wrapping [0] and Saturating [1] types, also provided as methods on numeric types (e.g. `usize::MAX.saturating_add(1)`).Regarding `as` casting, I completely agree. I am trying to use safe `From::from` instead. However, this is a bit noisy: `usize::from(n)` vs `n as usize`.[0] https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Wrapping.html [1] https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Saturating.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43585742</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "mem-isolate" by Brannon Dorsey provides a tool that allows users to isolate processes in memory in order to improve security and enhance application stability. It outlines the installation instructions, usage guidelines, and the methodology behind memory isolation, emphasizing its benefits for mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring safer system operations. The project is open-source, welcoming contributions and collaboration from developers interested in enhancing security features within software applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think this meets the definition of "safe" in "safe" Rust: "safe" doesn't just mean "won't crash due to spatial memory errors," it means that the code is in fact spatially and temporally memory safe.In other words: this won't detect memory unsafety that doesn't result in an abnormal exit or other detectable fault. If I'm writing an exploit, my entire goal is to perform memory corruption without causing a fault; that's why Rust's safety property is much stronger than crash-freeness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a way to sandbox native code without forking to a new process, and it looks like thishttps://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-weba...Firefox employs processes for sandboxing but for small components they are not worth the overhead. For those they employed this curious idea: first compile the potentially unsafe code to wasm (any other VM would work), then compile the wasm code to C (using the wasm2c tool). Then use this new C source normally in your program.All UB in the original code becomes logical bugs in the wasm, that can output incorrect values but not corrupt memory or do things that UB can do. Firefox does this to encapsulate C code, but it can be done with Rust too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't mentioned anywhere on the page, but fork is generally not a great API for these kinds of things. In a multi-threaded application, any code between the fork and exec syscalls should be async-signal-safe. Since the memory is replicated in full at the time of the call, the current state of mutexes is also replicated and if some thread was holding them at the time, there is a risk of a deadlock. A simple print! or anything that allocates memory can lead to a freeze. There's also an issue of user-space buffers, again printing something may write to a user-space buffer that, if not flushed, will be lost after the callback completes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601301</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a new method for charging electric vehicles five times faster in subfreezing temperatures, addressing a major challenge in EV performance during cold weather. The team utilized a unique thermal management approach that prevents battery degradation while enhancing charging efficiency. This innovation has significant implications for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, particularly in regions with harsh winter climates, and could improve user experience by reducing charging times substantially in such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Things that have a small solar panel, a battery, and no grid connection could benefit from this.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the brief tenure of Thomas Rattigan as CEO of Commodore International, highlighting his challenges and decisions during his leadership period in the early 1990s. Rattigan's time at Commodore was marked by significant strategic missteps and a failure to adapt to the rapidly changing personal computer market, ultimately contributing to the company's decline. The piece examines his background, the context of his appointment, and the controversies surrounding his management style and decision-making processes that led to his departure and the company's eventual bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

[The other Catholic school only had PET systems at the time.]I learned how to type there, and the rest was history. I owned a VIC20 already, and Dad purchased peripherals such as the 1541 and the 1701.It wasn’t until 3-4 years ago when I began to study history, Irish history in particular, and recognized that the model numbers weren’t chosen arbitrarily or accidentally, but indeed they correlated perfectly to the most ignominious dates in the history of the UK, when anti-Catholic laws were passed and the Irish were stomped into submission.It makes weird sense in retrospect. I mean, nobody ever taught Irish history in school because we are Americans now, and the whole Reformation thing is water under the bridge. And the superior general has a distinctly posh RP accent.Much like the “bitten apple” and its rainbow colors and the $666 price tag, these signs and symbols were hidden in plain sight, as harbingers and warning signs of future troubles.

&lt;p&gt;The article investigates the presence of toxic heavy metals in a commonly used bright red fire retardant. It details the findings from tests conducted on the substance, revealing significant levels of harmful chemicals that pose environmental and health risks. The piece underscores concerns about the safety of fire retardants in building materials and the lack of regulation surrounding their use, prompting calls for better testing and oversight to protect public health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

It happens. It’s not something we do.”I don’t get why they are acting like they have something to hide. Phosphate is mined from rock, rock contains all sorts of other elements including heavy metals. That’s simply how minerals work. It’s not by itself an indication that anyone has done anything wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like one of those things where context changes over time and takes a product outside of it's original use case.Fire retardant is an emergency measure, one that would rightly be expected to see exceptionally low usage overall. But over time, more people and property have gotten closer to the forest; forest fires affect more people for many reasons.So fire retardant use is not so rare.The Therac-20 was a fine piece of electro-mechanical-nuclear technology, but the Therac-25 moved the control scheme out of its original context, and took away some of the physical interlocks. The Therac-25 is not remembered fondly.Context changes over time, and assumptions need to be re-examined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "Phos-Chek MVP-Fx is primarily made of ammonium phosphates, which are derived from phosphate. That rock, when mined, can contain trace amounts of heavy metals."The thing they're catastrophizing about is rock phosphate—ordinary fertilizer that's mixed into the soil of every food farm in the world.I'm not sure if the journalists who wrote this article are aware of this. "It's COVERING my garden plants!" reads quite definitely when you recognize it's f'ing Miracle-Gro.https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-c...- "Phosphorus is an essential element for plant and animal nutrition.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Until the middle of the 20th Century, cartography was more an art than a science.Strange perspective, accurate nautical charts were critical infrastructure in the age of sail, making them and using them was a very technical endeavor backed by significant financing. The brightest scientists of the period spent a lot energy on the longitude problem and similar navigation bottlenecks. Accurate land maps were also important for military and state finance purposes. Much of early mathematics and astronomy were focused on measuring the Earth and pinpointing your location.I’m not sure if map-making was a science explicitly, there was no UX academia like there is now, but it was certainly a serious engineering field rather than an “art”, and dismissing that rich history of know-how seems like a poor foundation for a review of map-making theory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title needs a (2001) I skimmed the paper looking for new insight only to see it talk about stuff that's already prevalent.QGIS, FME, D3, Open layers, Mapbox, and others GIS related tools has been prevalent in all the workplaces I've worked at that needed something related to this topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the interest in this article from 2001?  There is a rich GIS and visualization history that has happened since then … if you really want to see something radical look at Wild Bill Bunge’s work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586043</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage provides lecture notes on gravitational wave (GW) programming, focusing on key concepts, tools, and methodologies involved in studying gravitational waves. It discusses the fundamental principles of gravitational wave physics, algorithms for waveform generation, and numerical techniques for solving related equations. The notes aim to serve as educational resources for students and researchers interested in the computational aspects of gravitational wave detection and analysis. Additionally, the content emphasizes the importance of software in astrophysics and gravitational wave research.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here: this are my notes on what I mean to say in class, the website contain my whole course.This particular lecture is still “in prep“, in fact the section "the problem" is just a bullet point and a figure. All other lectures are a bit more polished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless I'm missing something - do the notes cover neutrino astronomy somewhere else? Aside from the general discussion on stellar evolution. Shame, because the detection of pre-optical neutrino emission from 1987A by Kamiokande (and others) was a fantastic theoretical confirmation. Essentially when the core collapses, the environment around the surroundings are optically opaque, but the neutrinos sail on through so you'd expect to see them before the photons.https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...318L..63B/abstra...I would recommend Telescope in the Ice as one of the best introductions to modern neutrino detectors - why and where they're built. Also provides a good insight into how a big collaboration is formed, funded and operates. I've worked for IceCube so I'm somewhat biased, but the book is great just for the history.IceCube has an entire processing pathway (on ice) that is specifically designed to trigger on a supernova detection. One of the very few science results that would page us, and why uptime is absolutely critical to the experiment. On the one hand, we can't point the detector and we don't know where the signal will come from, so it's not predictable (and it's highly transient). On the other, becuase the burst happens shortly before the optical, we can use neutrinos to trigger optical observations as fast as possible - pretty much the whole observing community will drop what they're doing if a star blows up.I believe we'd expect the whole flux through the detector to bump up above the background, at least at IceCube.

It even handles file attachments well, which is something people are using more and more.https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introductionIt uses zod for types and validation, I've loved using it to make my apps swap between models easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just had very bad JSON mode operation with gemini-1.5-flash and 2.0-flash models using their own library 'google-generativeai'. Either can't follow JSON formatting correctly, or renders string fields with no end until max_tokens. Pretty bad for Gemini, when open models like Qwen do a better job of a basic information extraction to JSON task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using using [BAML](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml) to do this, and it works really well. Lets you have multiple different fallback and retry policies, and returns strongly typed outputs from LLMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580012</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our math teacher in UK high school c.1976 asked us if anyone want to join him for an adult education programming class being taught by the local university (Durham), and a bunch of us did. This was batch mode (punched card) PL/1 programming - submit job to operator and an hour later get a fanfold printout of the result. A couple of us (incl. me) had parents that worked at the University, and got the computer dept. to agree to allow us high school kids to go in on weekends etc to use the Unix system (online access) there, after the initial adult education class had ended. We spent a lot of time there, taught ourselves to program in C, and caused some amount of trouble by messing with the unix system - brute force password cracking, and on one occasion accidentally deleting the /etc/passwd file, which luckily they had backed up - they were surprisingly tolerant of all this and didn't kick us out!In March 1978 the first issue of "Personal Computer World" magazine came out, featuring the just released NASCOM-1 kit computer on the front cover. I'd just inherited 200 UKP from my grandmother, so sent it off and got myself a kit. This was a 1 MHz Z-80 system that came with 2 KB of memory (1KB for user, 1KB for system), and a built-in monitor program that let you enter programs as hex machine code. The computer itself came as bare board, bag of components to solder, and no case. It used a TV for display and cassette recorder for program/data storage. You'd hand assemble your program on paper, then enter the codes and run it. There wasn't a whole lot you could do in 1KB, but I remember coding things like a hangman game, and memorizing the op-codes well enough to program short things directly in hex.I then went to college, taking Math &amp; Comp Sci, graduating in 1982, and lucking into a dream job at Acorn Computers, which started my career as developer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In middle school my parents got me a graphing calculator for Algebra. Couldn't figure out a damn thing about how to write programs on it, and I didn't really have much computer or internet access at home, but I was curious.In the school computer lab I did some searching and found a programming guide for that model of calculator on some university website. While printing out my assignment I also secretly printed out the guide and hid it under the other papers (not supposed to be wasting ink on a personal print job). Took it home and was glued to it for months.Eventually I was able to program the game Snake. It ran slow as hell, but it ran.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was 9 when I first moved to the US. I couldn't speak English so the teacher stuck me in front of the classroom computer. It was one of those monochrome all-in-one console things that must have been from the 80's and the only thing on there was Q-basic. To pass the time I followed the tutorials to create my own MUD. And that's how I learned BASIC before English.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564625</guid></item><item><title>31.

Wrong ^. Low-code gives you the tools to create a website. Great. Distribution is what disrupts. Platforms won because they aggregate traffic. When you break up the platform, you diffuse the traffic along with it.The exception is sometimes there are whales: dominant content creators that win most of the clicks.

This made me realize he is not the genius he is made out to be but instead he is a fraud/charlatan and over the years his statements on different topics have only hardened that belief. Why the fuck would you want ai cars to be the same as humans you should want them to be many times better and radarr/lidar sonarr type tech make them better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This problem has been solved more than a decade ago by radar sensors (standard on many mid-range cars at the time). They detect imminent collisions with almost perfect accuracy and very little false positives. Having better sensor data is always going to beat trying to massage crappy data into something useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other comment pointing this out has been (ridiculously) flagged, so I'll repeat the point that was made:The analysis is useless if it doesn't account for the base rate fallacy (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy)The first thing I thought before even reading the analysis was "Does the author account for it?" And indeed he makes no mention that he did.So after reading the whole article I have no idea whether Tesla's automatic driving is any worse at detecting motorcycles than my Subaru's (which BTW also uses only visual sensors).Antidisclaimer: I hate both Teslas and Musk.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of federal government layoffs on major hiking trails, specifically the Pacific Crest and Appalachian Trails. As funding is affected, there are concerns about the maintenance and safety of these trails, which are vital to outdoor recreation and local economies. The article highlights the importance of trail upkeep and the potential for diminished visitor experiences if services cannot be maintained due to financial constraints. It underscores the intersection of federal policy and outdoor adventurism, emphasizing the need for continued support for such recreational areas.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brookings Institute has a good plot showing how much federal spending is being cut by this administration:https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-federal-expendit...Turns out all the cuts are only a fraction of a percent of the federal budget. It's an ideological purge, nothing to do with efficiency at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These cuts are particularly nasty because federal spending on public trail maintenance is already razor thin. A ton of the Pacific Crest Trail and other scenic trails are already primarily maintained by volunteer groups doing work like log clearing, brush removal, and tread work. Trail users ourselves—hikers, mountain bikers, or trail runners—already put in hundreds of volunteer hours every season doing the basic trail work, and that's just regular seasonal maintenance. Significant work rebuilding parts of the Appalachian Trail and PCT after wildfires or hurricanes will likely not happen this year, or for years to come, unless volunteers fill in more gaps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you searched for "Arizona Trail southern terminus" you'll see what the terminus looks like today: a beautiful* monument shadowed by a half built useless wall that cost way more than the government spending to maintain some of the most beautiful trails in the world.These cuts would not just put trail users (which aren't just hikers but also firefighters, hunters) in danger but also cause damage to national parks and national forests as trail users would have to find alternate routes that go off trail.* It is, in my opinion, the most scenic terminus of all national scenic trails. The (half built) ugliness of the looming wall is an insult to the beauty of the American West.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603111</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses hydration errors in data systems, emphasizing how inaccuracies in data hydration can lead to inefficient processes and incorrect insights. It outlines common causes of hydration errors, such as misconfigured data pipelines and poor integration with database systems. The post also explores strategies to identify and mitigate these errors, including implementing automated monitoring tools and improving data governance practices. By addressing hydration errors, organizations can enhance data reliability and make better-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't help but feel that all the approaches avoiding the error by using delayed state are missing the forest for the trees. The error tells you that the client and the server disagreed on what the output is. If the client has different data, for example due to local storage, that's the expected behavior! Don't mangle your code with weird workarounds for something that isn't broken. Similar to all other rules, it's important to know when the rule should be broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One reason you may care about hydration errors is because it’s an awkward user experience.I don't know.. A hydration error is 100% an application logic error. It's not some "slightly worse UX". It means you are actually doing something incorrectly. I would even compare it to C++ UB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43583134</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Gmail's end-to-end (E2E) encryption, arguing that it falls short of expectations and poses usability concerns. It highlights the limitations of Gmail's E2E encryption, including difficulties in implementation, lack of support for certain features, and potential security vulnerabilities. The author emphasizes that while E2E encryption is a positive step towards enhancing email privacy, Gmail's execution leaves much to be desired, ultimately raising questions about its effectiveness and reliability in protecting user data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was already happening, unfortunately. The user's mail agent is deemed untrustworthy (and so is the user), so every service which needs to send confidential data just turns your email into a notification with a link. There are so many of these, but often they are limited in scope. For sectors like healthcare you have companies offering this type of service to companies which need to adhere to security theatre standards such as ISO 27001, and because nations often have their own added requirements for specific sectors (think HIPAA in the US or NEN 7510 in the Netherlands) these services tend to remain focussed on single countries.Then there are the national governments and things like insurance companies. All happily sending message notifications where you need to sign in to their own portals.Securing email is too complex, so everyone builds their own secured portal thingy, and your mailbox has become a receptacle for notifications. Figuring out a solution would require cooperation, pragmatic lawmaking, and giving up those nice cashcows of moated portals, so it won't happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in China could not open a url sent in Gmail. I happened to be in China, I tried to open the webpage and it worked, no firewall.I hovered on the link in Gmail and Chrome told me left bottom it was just that exact url.But when I opened the url it got blocked by the great firewall.Why? Any link in Gmail secretly gets replaced by a link to Google that tracks you and then redirects you to the original link.The most obnoxious thing about this I think is that Chrome shows the original link.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is how all HIPAA "secure email" works. Outlook, Zoho, clinic comms, BECAUSE it lets you revoke email access.If you want an opportunity in this space, it isn't actually encrypted emails, but possibly standardizing and streamlining such "message pointers" and address endpoint verification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43604308</guid></item><item><title>39.

The industry term for lossy compression that appears to be basically the same as the source is "visually transparent" or just "transparent". Though this doesn't seem like that either, especially when you're compressing large PNGs into JPGs while naming the output as PNGs. That's just outright deceitful, and not a good look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In image compression "lossless" is a term of the art. What you're doing is a practically useful quality degradation, but it's not lossless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599470</guid></item><item><title>40.

Plus the "fake expert" thing is just so embarrassingly stupid...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first time I heard this, it took me about four seconds to realize that it was an anagram of his last name.

In reality, the only sites deindexed were Google and Bing.This shows that the limits of the first amendment are speech when its convenient. Links, webpages, and more are speech, but also completely censored in the US media.Weirdly, Russian based companies have less a problem with the free speech the USA kicks us offline for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish studios would share these behind-the-curtain versions more often, but I suppose that would go against their apparent belief that CGI is a dirty word that can never be acknowledged even if that means outright lying about how much they used. The last Planet of the Apes movie did go there though, the 4K Bluray includes a "raw cut" of the entire movie which shows exactly what the camera saw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nfo: https://pastebin.com/iLk9B0efCOMMENTS:                                 │

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the UK's ban on misleading practices related to online products, specifically targeting £22 billion worth of "sneaky fees" and fake reviews. It highlights new regulations intended to enhance transparency and protect consumers from hidden costs and deceptive marketing tactics. The measures aim to foster fair competition among businesses and ensure that consumers can make informed decisions when shopping online. The initiative reflects growing concerns over consumer rights and the integrity of online marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the actual government announcement (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fake-reviews-and-sneaky-h...):&gt; Website hosts are accountable for the reviews on their page. Businesses and online platforms will be legally required to take steps to prevent and remove the publication of fake reviews that are published on their websites. This could include, for example, having adequate detection and removal procedures in place to prevent fake reviews being published.I guess the big question is what that ends up meaning, and how well it's enforced. If companies start getting significant fines for hosting fake reviews (especially the likes of Google and Amazon) then that might encourage them to do something about them - but that requires an enforcement agency with teeth, and for them to prove that the reviews are fake, which often isn't easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It sounds great but how do you prevent it? The sellers are all based abroad.If I look at any product on Amazon now, say a USB C cable, it’s full of fake reviews. Take this one as an example which came up as a sponsored link - 4.3/5 rated - https://amzn.eu/d/bHCXNQG - 7% of reviews are 1* and variously say that the description is misleading in capabilities of the cable, the cable broke, etc.If you look at the 5* reviews and click through to any profile writing them, they’re giving out all 5* reviews on a totally random array of cheap Chinese products. On top of that they’re always on products that no real person would buy since they’re always a mixture of things aimed at young/old and male/female, and yet the reviews are all written in the first person. If you’re not at least skeptical you will end up wasting money on rubbish. You have to now look at the distribution of reviews rather than the overall average since fake ones at 4 and 5 star swamp all else.Here in the U.K. I prefer Argos for small purchases I used to make from Amazon, but it’s not got the full range of items you might want to buy online unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad to see this.Booking fee, service fee, transaction fee, technology fee, banking fee, payment handling fee, convenience fee, venue fee, ticket handling fee, verification fee, administration fee etc etc etc.So underhanded - they're just making fees up at this stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599438</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My small business produces a niche consumer electronic device. Anyone watching us operate would say that our product is Made in the USA. But the components of our product are sourced and pre-processed all over the world and our COGS just increased significantly due to tariffs.We now have to raise our prices, but our Made in China competitors have to increase theirs even more.  That isn't a net benefit for us, given the product is "nice to have" and does not have an inelastic price.If my sales drop by 50% and the Chinese competitors drop by 75%, is that winning ? I am still in shock and denial by all this. After 11 years in business, this manufactured/avoidable crisis can't be what ends us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any additional cost on top of the 'natural' costs involved with producing a result raises prices.Additional costs that direct resources to a government are a form of a tax, this includes direct taxes at the point of sale, and it should also include taxes incurred for traversing an arbitrary interface (tariff or toll).Any form of tax on goods / services proportionately effects those who spend more of their income on those goods / services more.  Tariffs on not-luxury goods are regressive taxes on the poor and middle class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs only make sense to protect a fledgling domestic industry which is already receiving investment. Even then, does anyone think that for instance US car makers will suddenly be competitive globally?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601766</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the proposal to make C string literals constant, emphasizing the benefits of this change for improving code safety and reducing bugs related to string manipulation. The author outlines the current behavior of string literals in C, which allows for unintended modifications, and suggests that enforcing constancy would lead to better practices and clearer intentions in code. The post highlights potential implications for developers and the overall enhancement of the language's robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misconception that startups must pursue massive scale and rapid growth to be considered successful. It argues that many startups can find value and sustainability through smaller, niche markets and that prioritizing customer satisfaction and sustainable practices can lead to long-term success. The author encourages entrepreneurs to define success on their own terms rather than conforming to conventional startup norms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a model that exists in Germany, which I like:You can present a business plan to the state's investment bank and apply for several financial aides, including:* 1.5 years of universal basic income for you plus up to 2 other people. It's a tiny amount of money, but the point is to free you up to invest your actual time an money into the business. You do not have to pay this back.* up to 20k EUR in "consulting fees", for which the bank will contribute up to 50%. Again, you don't have to pay it back, but obviously you need money for them to match.* discounted loans, amount depends on business plan outlookI've worked with an accelerator that helps founders write the required pitches and plans for this program. And while the majority don't make it (because they mostly realize their idea won't actually hold up to business planning scrutiny), some do. And those don't become hyperscaling unicorns, they become normal companies, growing organically as stable, solvent employers in the region.Every once in a while a VC would stick its head in and encourage the startup to take on VC funding, and for an even smaller percentage (one in my time doing this), this worked. But for me, the organic growers are the best success story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in a country (Germany) that is famous for having a lot of "mittelstand". These are basically family owned businesses. Some large German companies fall under this. Aldi and LIDL for example, which are super market chains that at this point have a global presence. And some large companies (Bosch, Siemens, VW, etc.) are actually a multitude of smaller companies. Much of the German economy is smaller and bigger specialized companies doing their thing. Only some of them are public companies.What these companies have in common is that they start small and then grow organically. The main issue from a VC point of view is not that these aren't good companies but that it can take decades for them to turn into big companies. But from the point of view of the people founding these businesses, it's a good, honest way to succeed in life.There's nothing wrong with the principle of starting a company to make money from whatever it is you do at whatever scale you are doing it. But it should drive your decision making as to whether or not you give chunks of your company away to an investor. It might stop being your company if you do.Also, if you go down this path. Stop calling yourself a startup. It scares away customers. They don't want to hear that you are a flaky wannabe that is still figuring it out. They want to hear about your other customers and how awesome whatever it is you are selling is. They want to be re-assured that it is safe for them to enter into a multi year customer relationship with you. Projecting that you are new to all this company stuff and might not be around in six months is exactly the wrong message for them. They don't want to hear about what you are going to do, they want to hear about what you have done already. The stuff that gets VCs horny will scare away customers. If you are pitching customers and VCs at the same time, make sure you have two very different pitches. And if you are going to pitch VCs, it actually helps if you have customers. The more business you have the stronger your negotiation position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always conflicted about this because it's like saying the sky is blue.Stepping outside of the VC startup bubble, we see small self-funded businesses are the norm. It's the neighborhood businesses all around us.82% of all US business have &lt;10 employees

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am so conflicted about this project every time it comes up.I think I understood for quite some time what it wants to do (Though when checking the website there always creeps in doubt, because it is so incomprehensible) and every year when I download the application again, it looks a bit more cleaner, a bit easier to just use. But still, basic things always elude me. Do I really have to read the handbook to figure out how to format text in the knowledge base? Half the windows and symbols just make no sense, etc. Try pressing a button to see what it does and now everything looks different and what even happened?It seems to glacially improve on that front and I know to really use it, I have to learn to program it, but I am also of the mind basic functionality should be self explanatory. And pharo itself as the basis of this seems so convoluted and complex, I wonder if I even want to get into this.And then, the community seems to solely be on discord still, and that is then always the point were I bow out and wonder if cuis smalltalk or other systems with simplicity as core tenant are not much nicer to use and I should look there. Of course, in the end, I never get more than surface deep into smalltalk, because while I want the tools to build my own environment, if I need to build them first, there is always more pressing work...But honestly, a great knowledge base and data visualization I can intuitively just use and then expand later on with my own programs sounds like a dream workspace. It's just, that it is really hard to get into at the moment. I don't know any python, but I could just use jupyter know and learn as I go, but sadly, I never get that feeling here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome.  Had a feeling this was going to be a smalltalk thing.  Seems to involve/extend moose[1] among other things.Judging from the comments and such interesting projects languishing in obscurity.. smalltalk / pharo[2] still has a PR problem even though I think a lot of people are kind of fascinated by the ideas of image-based persistence[3].  The typical easy comparisons to VMs, IDEs, and notebooks all seem to fail to capture an important part of the essence.  Hence the need for new vocabulary like "moldable development" and "contextual micro tools" which is all part of the appeal and part of the problem.  It really is a different kind of thing.I (still) hope it all catches on a bit more but my sense is that it probably needs to present itself as a bit less academic.  Compare the moose touting of "meta-meta-modeling" with something like gritql[4], which focuses more on use-cases, and seems to be gaining in popularity rather than remaining obscure.  Seems like maybe it's time for a change in tactics to bring in a wider audience.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose_(analysis)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a viral phenomenon in Japan involving a middle-aged man who became popular for trading rare Pokémon cards. It highlights how this unexpected trend has captivated audiences and sparked discussions about nostalgia, the evolving image of collectors, and the appeal of Pokémon in contemporary Japanese culture. The man’s story illustrates the intersection of childhood memories and adult hobbies, showing how trading cards can bridge generational gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

There are so many amazing people here. I thought it was such a shame that no one knew about them,” [...] “Since the card game went viral, so many kids are starting to look up to these men as heroic figures.” 
&gt; Kids have started attending local events and volunteering for community activities — just for a chance to meet the ojisan from their cards. Participation in town events has reportedly doubled since the game launched.there's so much more I want to comment on--it's not screen-based, increased cross-generational interaction, strengthening community, elders having their stories known--but what I love is that these effects will compound into even greater benefits for the community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comment section is a perfect example of how this could not exist in the west without some shitstorm trying to destroy it.I contuing to ignore 3/4:1 male suicide rates is one "solution" mitigate demographic aging..https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicid...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of the fisherman call where you could sign up to have a professional fisherman give you a wake up call.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the Camera RAW format, which is a type of file used by digital cameras to store unprocessed image data. It discusses how different manufacturers, such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Fujifilm, create their own RAW formats, leading to compatibility issues in post-processing. The piece highlights Adobe's Digital Negative (DNG) format as a standardized alternative that can preserve image quality while ensuring broader compatibility across software and devices. The article also delves into the advantages of using RAW files for photographers, including greater control over editing, and explores the implications of adopting DNG as a universal format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580815"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, RAW formats aren't that complex, and camera firmware is mostly developed in countries that don't have strong open source software traditions.Look at the decoders for each format that darktable supports here:
https://github.com/darktable-org/rawspeed/tree/develop/src/l...It's some binary parsing, reading metadata, maybe doing some decompression-- a thousand lines of C++ on average for each format. These aren't complex codecs like HEVC and only reach JPEG complexity by embedding them as thumbnails!Cameras absolutely could emit DNG instead, but that would require more development friction: coordination (with Adobe), potentially a language barrier, and potentially making it harder to do experimental features.Photographers rarely care, so it doesn't appreciably impact sales. Raw processing software packages have generally good support available soon after new cameras are released.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raw decoding is not as simple as you might think.It’s the best place to add “signature steps.” Things like noise reduction, chromatic aberration correction, and one-step HDR processing.I used to work for a camera manufacturer, and our Raw decoder was an extremely intense pipeline step. It was treated as one of the biggest secrets in the company.Third-party deinterlacers could not exactly match ours, although they could get very good results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One problem is that you cannot have a universal format that is both truly raw and doesn't embed camera specific information. Camera sensors from different companies (and different generations) don't have the same color (or if you prefer, spectral) responses with both their Bayer filter layer and the underlying physical sensor. If you have truly raw numbers, you need the specific spectral response information to interpret them; if you don't need spectral response information, you don't actually have truly raw numbers. People very much want raw numbers for various reasons, and also camera companies are not really enthused about disclosing the spectral response characteristics of their sensors (although people obviously reverse engineer them anyway).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580815</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An important caveat from the paper&gt;Moreover, we follow previous work in accelerating block breaking because learning to hold a button for hundreds of consecutive steps would be infeasible for stochastic policies, allowing us to focus on the essential challenges inherent in Minecraft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The “holding a button” thing actually resonated. It feels like the real work here is engineering the reward structure to make exploration even remotely viable. Dreamer’s world model might be cool, but most of the heavy lifting still seems to come from how forgiving the Minecraft environment is for training.I do wonder though: if you swapped Minecraft for a cloud-based synthetic world with similar physics but messier signals, like object permanence or social reasoning, would Dreamer still hold up? Or is it just really good at the kind of clean reward hierarchies that games offer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key to Dreamer’s success, says Hafner, is that it builds a model of its surroundings and uses this ‘world model’ to ‘imagine’ future scenarios and guide decision-making.Can you look at the world model, like you can look at Waymo's world model? Or is it hidden inside weights?Machine learning with world models is very interesting, and the people doing it don't seem to say much about what the models look like. The Google manipulation work talks endlessly about the natural language user interface, but when they get to motion planning, they don't say much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584015</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The repository hosts the "Elimination Game," a coding project that involves creating a game where players are sequentially eliminated based on specific rules or mechanics. It includes source code, documentation, and instructions for setting up and running the game. The project aims to demonstrate programming skills and game development concepts, providing a collaborative environment for developers to contribute, modify, or learn from the existing codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's an interesting benchmark. It feels like it tests skills that are very relevant to digital assistants, story writing and role play.Some thoughts about the setup:- the setup seems to give reasoning models an inherent advantage because only they have a private plan and a public text in the same output. I feel like giving all models the option to formulate plans and keep track of other players inside &lt;think&gt; or &lt;secret&gt; tags would level the playing field more.- from personal experience with social tasks for LLMs it helps both reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to explicitly ask them to plan their next steps, in a way they are assured is kept hidden from all other players. That might be a good addition here either before or after the public subround- the individual rounds are pretty short. Humans would struggle to coordinate in so few exchanges with so few words. If this was done for context limitations, asking models to summarize the game state from their perspective, then giving them only the current round, the previous round and their own summary of the game before that might be a good strategy.It would be cool to have some code to play around with to test how changes in the setup change the results. I guess it isn't that difficult to write, but it's peculiar to have the benchmark but no code to run it yourself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was interested to find that the Claudes did the most betraying, and were betrayed very little; somewhat surprising given its boy-scout exterior.(Then again, apparently the president of the local Diplomacy Society attends my church; I discovered this when another friend whom I'd invited saw him, and quipped that he was surprised he hadn't been struck by lightning at the door.)DeepSeek and Gemini 2.5 had both a low betrayer and betrayed rate.o3-mini and DeepSeek had the highest number of first-place finishes, but were only in the upper quartile in the TrueSkill leaderboard; presumably because they played more risky strategies, that would either lead ot complete winning or early drop-out?Also interesting that o1 was only way to sway the final jury a bit more than 50% of the time, while o3-mini managed 63% of the time.Anyway, really cool stuff!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using QwQ-32B a lot recently and while I quite like it (especially given its size), I noticed it will often misinterpret the system prompt as something I (the user) said, revealing secrets or details that only the agent is supposed to know. When I saw that it topped the "earliest out" chart, I wondered if that was part of the reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586380</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Baby Steps into Genetic Programming" discusses the fundamentals of genetic programming (GP) and its application in solving problems. It introduces the concept of evolving programs and algorithms using principles inspired by natural selection, explaining how solutions can be automatically generated through iterative processes. The author outlines basic components of GP, including representation, selection, and mutation, while providing practical examples to illustrate the concepts. The aim is to provide readers with a foundational understanding of genetic programming and its potential uses in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the website (ai-contest.com) that the post links to seems to have been hijacked by a gambling site.For the use-cases where Genetic Programming was popular, I would recommend looking at Bayesian Optimization (bayesopt) as an alternative today (I know I keep recommending the area - but I hope I do when it is relevant :-)). This is mostly because IMHO it has a principled foundation that has been productively developed further in the past few years. Here's a good book on the topic [1], and I've a tutorial as well [2]. Interestingly one of the books I had encountered when reading up on Genetic Algo. years ago was by Melanie Mitchell [3]!Bayesopt or Genetic Programming, or any search algorithm that can operate over non-differentiable objective functions are very useful in practice. For ex, when performing model selection in the space of hyperparameters, when your model is not differentiable such as a traditional Decision Tree [4]. Or exotic use-cases like molecule discovery [5].You can try out bayesopt using the botorch or hyperopt libraries. The latter only implements a specific bayesopt algo. which was/is popular but it seems to have been bettered of late [4].[1] https://bayesoptbook.com/[2] Part 1 https://blog.quipu-strands.com/bayesopt_1_key_ideas_GPs[3] Found a free copy online https://www.boente.eti.br/fuzzy/ebook-fuzzy-mitchell.pdf[4] "... Analysis of the Black-Box Optimization Challenge 2020" https://proceedings.mlr.press/v133/turner21a.html[5] ChemBO is an example but there are others https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/korovina20a.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice writeup, short so is more approachable than John Koza’s classic book on GP. That said, if GP looks useful to you, eventually read Koza’s book, or at least experiment with his Common Lisp code.Also don’t confuse Genetic Algorithms (GA) with GP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naive question: what are the most suitable problems that Genetic Programming is to solve, despite that machine learning especially deep learning is all the rage now? Or do we have models that integrate genetic programming into deep learning?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605731</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Decoding the 90s" explores the cultural, technological, and social shifts that defined the 1990s, a decade marked by the rise of the internet, the popularity of grunge music, and the emergence of new media forms such as video games and animated television shows. It examines how these elements influenced fashion, communication, and youth culture, while also reflecting on the era's broader implications for contemporary society. The piece highlights nostalgic elements and draws connections between the past and present, encouraging readers to appreciate the complexities and innovations of the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have encountered my fair share of in-house RC4 implementations from the 90s.  Every single one of them was vulnerable in some way.  They suffered from all kinds of issues: improper IV initialisation, predictable keystreams, and even partial leakage of plaintext into ciphertext.  RC4's deceptively simple specification made it enticing to implement, giving developers a false sense of confidence and security.As another example, Microsoft Outlook 2003 infamously used CRC32 to "hash" the personal folder (.PST) passwords: &lt;https://www.nirsoft.net/articles/pst_password_bug.html&gt;.  Naturally, it was trivial to find a CRC32 checksum collision and open someone else's PST.Thankfully, the industry has come a long way since then.  These days, rolling your own cipher is, quite rightly, considered a red flag!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why waste 2 seconds of my time making your website have a splash screen?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this would be less fun, but given that the key space was only 36^4, why not just run the actual decryption functionality in QText? Like, even if it takes 1 second to decrypt, spin up 32 cores and wait a day. They allude to the idea that checking the key derivation is faster, but I wonder by how much.(of course, it’s still interesting to read about 90s encryption, so I appreciate that they did it the fun way)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612102</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the mathematical principles underlying crochet, exploring how various crochet patterns can be analyzed through geometry and symmetry. It highlights the importance of understanding stitches, shapes, and the effects of tension on gauge, demonstrating that crochet is not only a creative craft but also a mathematical practice. The author emphasizes the relationship between math and art, encouraging crocheters to appreciate the structural elements of their work while engaging with mathematical concepts like geometry and pattern repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article celebrates the 20th anniversary of Git, highlighting its development history, key features, and its impact on software development. It outlines how Git originated from Linus Torvalds' need for a distributed version control system for the Linux kernel and discusses its growth and adoption in the tech community. The piece also emphasizes Git's role in facilitating collaboration among developers, enhancing workflow efficiency, and supporting modern software development practices. Additionally, it reflects on the future of Git and the ongoing evolution of version control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s something that bothers me about these sorts of recollections that make git seem… inevitable.There’s this whole creation myth of how Git came to be that kind of paints Linus as some prophet reading from golden tablets written by the CS gods themselves.Granted, this particular narrative in the blog post does humanise a bit more, remembering the stumbling steps, how Linus never intended for git itself to be the UI, how there wasn’t even a git commit command in the beginning, but it still paints the whole thing in somewhat romantic tones, as if the blob-tree-commit-ref data structure were the perfect representation of data.One particular aspect that often gets left out of this creation myth, especially by the author of Github is that Mercurial had a prominent role. It was created by Olivia Mackall, another kernel hacker, at the same time as git, for the same purpose as git. Olivia offered Mercurial to Linus, but Linus didn’t look upon favour with it, and stuck to his guns. Unlike git, Mercurial had a UI at the very start. Its UI was very similar to Subversion, which at the time was the dominant VCS, so Mercurial always aimed for familiarity without sacrificing user flexibility. In the beginning, both VCSes had mind share, and even today, the mindshare of Mercurial lives on in hg itself as well as in worthy git successors such as jujutsu.And the git data structure isn’t the only thing that could have ever possibly worked. It falls apart for large files. There are workaround and things you can patch on top, but there are also completely different data structures that would be appropriate for larger bits of data.Git isn’t just plain wonderful, and in my view, it’s not inevitable either. I still look forward to a world beyond git, whether jujutsu or whatever else may come.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around 2002 or so, I had an idea to tag every part of a project with a unique hash code. With a hash code, one could download the corresponding file. A hash code for the whole project would be a file containing a list of hash codes for the files that make up the project. Hash codes could represent the compiler that builds it, along with the library(s) it links with.I showed it to a couple software entrepreneuers (Wild Tangent and Chromium), but they had no interest in it.I never did anything else with it, and so it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I started using Git for something you might not imagine it was intended for, only a few months after it’s first commitI started using git around 2007 or so because that company I worked for at the time used ClearCase, without a doubt the most painful version manager I have ever used (especially running it from a Linux workstation). So I wrote a few scripts that would let me mirror a directory into a git repo, do all my committing in git, then replay those commits back to ClearCase.I can't recall how Git came to me attention in the first place, but by late 2008 I was contributing patches to Git itself. Junio was a kind but exacting maintainer, and I learned a lot about contributing to open source from his stewardship. I even attended one of the early GitTogethers.As far as I can recall, I've never really struggled with git. I think that's because I like to dissect how things work, and under the covers git is quite simple. So I never had too much trouble with its terribly baroque CLI.At my next job, I was at a startup that was building upon a fork of Chromium. At the time, Chromium was using subversion. But at this startup, we were using git, and I was responsible for keeping our git mirror up-to-date. I also had the terrible tedious job of rebasing our fork with Chromium's upstream changes. But boy did I get good at resolving merge conflicts.Git may be the CLI I've used most consistently for nearly two decades. I'm disappointed that GitHub became the main code-review tool for Git, but I'll never be disappointed that Git beat out Mercurial, which I always found overly ridged and was never able to adapt it to my workflow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613305</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I evaluated D1 for a project a few months ago, and found that global performance was pretty terrible. I don't know what exactly the issue with their architecture is, but if you look at the time-to-first-byte numbers here[1], you can see that even for the D1 demo database the numbers outside Europe are abysmal, and even within Europe having a TTFB of &gt; 200ms isn't great.This post helps understand some basic DB pitfalls for frontend developers, but I wouldn't use D1 regardless. If you can figure out how to use D1 as a frontend dev, you can use a hosted Postgres solution and get much more power and performance.[1] https://speedvitals.com/ttfb-test?url=https://northwind.d1sq...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has anyone tried analyzing Durable Object with SQL storage performance? Is it as bad as D1?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another fun limitation is that a transaction cannot span multiple D1 requests, so you can't select from the database, execute application logic, and then write to the database in an atomic way. At most, you can combine multiple statements into a single batch request that is executed atomically.When I needed to ensure atomicity in such a multi-part "transaction", I ended up making a batch request, where the first statement in the batch checks a precondition and forces a JSON parsing error if the precondition is not met, aborting the rest of the batch statements.  SELECT
    IIF(&lt;precondition&gt;, 1, json_extract("inconsistent", "$")) AS consistent
  FROM ...


I was lucky here. For anything more complex, one would probably need to create tables to store temporary values, and translate a lot of application logic into SQL statements to achieve atomicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43572511</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Where the Money Comes From" by Sean Goedecke explores the various sources of funding for philanthropic endeavors and nonprofit organizations. It highlights the importance of understanding the diversity of revenue streams, including individual donations, corporate sponsorships, grants from foundations, and government funding. The piece emphasizes the need for transparency and strategic planning in fundraising efforts, as well as the impact that economic conditions and donor motivations can have on financial support. Ultimately, it aims to provide insights into optimizing funding strategies for sustainable impact.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"At successful tech companies, engineering work is valued in proportion to how much money it makes the company"You would think that,  but decades of experience have disproved that.Most of management, past first-gen if the company was founded by engineers, is non-technical.Most are (more or less) aware that somewhere technical engineering in software is needed, but they feel that as a threath rather than an asset. If engineering is not a commodity, they fear being called out for not being in touch with the grounded reality of the business, and fear the  unpredictability this entails for their own operation.So they will tend to treat engineering like a commodity, generic and interchangable at will, and even deliberatly not recognize differential contribution by engineers to the company's success.This is also why once non-technical management has consolidated, rising from engineering into management will become very difficult, often requiring you deny your technical competences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article makes the naive assumption that "what is making money" is an objective thing.Once a company reaches a certain size, basically once it has a financial planning department w/ different VPs owning their PnL, who is making money increasingly becomes a social construct. "how to get promoted" by spakhm is much more closer to how a large, successful org works IMO: https://spakhm.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promotedI've seen this in my career multiple times. For example, when I was involved in search for some companies, we would demonstrate through A/B testing that we would make X more money per month. Executive team changed, they decided that "A/B test does not work and slows us down", the definition of making money changed, we overnight went from a money-aking org to a cost center.Nowadays, most companies are pushing GenAI everywhere. Most of those things don't make money, and yet a lot of promotions will be obtained across the board until the tune ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on a product that has been built over 25 years. Lots of the work I did years ago is to ensure the product longevity.Lots of the work I do now is to ensure it lasts another 25 years. Thats good, but its only the start of "my work".It's up to me to "sell" that benefit to upper management. There's no point in assuming they'll figure it out by accident. Part of my job is enumerating the value I add.By all means work on technical debt. But be sure to make a compelling case as to how the eradication of that debt will impact the project over the next decade. Try and throw in immediate results as well (faster, more reliable, reduced support) but more importantly translate that into terms that measure the improvement in cold hard cash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603646</guid></item><item><title>14.

We already package lua and a few C extensions. C extensions are the bread and butter for Pixi, so I think it could be a good fit!- pixi.sh (docs)
- lua package on the registry: https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/packages/lua&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution env is the achille's heel of scripting languages. Personally I don't use Neovim, but had a feeling its adoption would spur development in this area for Lua. Bryan Cantrill called Javascript "LISP in C's clothes". In some ways I feel like Lua is the opposite, and love it for those reasons (disclaimer: never had to use it at work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know some projects like Koreader[1] use Lua as their primary application language. If you could convince one of them to switch, it would provide some assurances about the maturity and popularity of the idea.[1]: https://github.com/koreader/koreader&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43614285</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Rive has redefined the concept of feathering in the context of vector graphics, moving beyond traditional methods to enhance creativity and precision in design. It explains that Rive’s approach allows for more fluid and dynamic animations while maintaining control over the visual quality of vector art. By integrating feathering techniques that respond to user interactions, Rive aims to provide designers with innovative tools for creating engaging and interactive experiences in the modern digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

Hoping for a follow-up that dives in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can achieve a gaussian blur effect using an infinite impulse response thing[1]. Some very clever people at IBM came up with the idea, and some other very clever people translated that code to Javascript and stuck it on GitHub for the rest of the world to use[2].[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response[2] - https://github.com/nodeca/glur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not completely buying this. He's claiming that it's better to do vector based feathering, but it's not at all clear that his approach isn't just as computationally expensive, or more. Filters do require a lot of calculations, but they are embarrassingly parallel and also you get help from the Convolution Theorem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577338</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great work - one of the rules for code written with Basis was not to use the system clock. I somewhat got around the network determinism by shimming out all network calls, and rather than going single threaded, writing a scheduler (https://basisrobotics.tech/2024/09/02/determinism/). My goal wasn’t to get ci-&gt;dev machine determinism, at least immediately, because callback ordering determinism was so important. Love seeing other work done in this space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the advantage of integrating this at a library level instead of just compiling it and running in Shadow? https://github.com/shadow/shadow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it was mentioned at the end, I was curious what are some of the notable issues that were find using the DST approach, and how did it benefit the development of the   system? I would also be curious if a LLM system would be able to help analyze the TRACE logs ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581900</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how approximately 90% of the data stored in data centers is considered "crap data," which refers to data that is redundant, outdated, or irrelevant. It emphasizes the inefficiencies and costs associated with managing this excess data, highlighting that organizations need to prioritize data management and governance to improve decision-making and optimize storage resources. The piece advocates for a focus on quality data over quantity to enhance overall business value and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One organization I knew of had 1,500 terabytes of data, with less than 2% ever having been accessed after it was first stored.On a related note, probably a similar percentage of people claim on their car insurance. If only the rest realised they had "crap insurance" and were paying for nothing, they could save so much money!This is obviously sarcasm, but I think it's important to remember that much of the data is stored because we don't know what we will need later. Photos of kids? Maybe that one will be The One that we end up framing? Miscellaneous business records? Maybe those will be the ones we have to dig out for a tax audit? Web pages on government sites? Maybe there will suddenly be an interest in obscure pages on public health policy if a global pandemic happens.Complaining that data is mostly junk is not a particularly interesting conclusion without acknowledging this. Is there wastage? Yeah sure, but accuracy on what needs storing is directly traded off with time spent figuring that out, and often it's cheaper to store the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About a decade and a half ago I worked on a large data migration project at a FAANG. Multi-exabyte scale, many clusters across many countries. Once everyone was moved the old storage platform wasn't completely empty, because the number of migrations was large and users were (naturally) more focused on ensuring their data was in place and available on the target platform rather than ensuring every last thing was deleted on the legacy platform. We weren't initially concerned about it because it would all get deleted when we turned down the old setup.As we were gearing up to declare victory and start turning down the several dozen legacy storage clusters someone mused that given some users were subject to litigation holds -- not allowed to delete any data -- that at least some of the leftover data on the old system might be subject to litigation hold, and we'd need to figure that out before we could delete it or incur legal risk. IIRC the leftover 'junk' data amounted to a few dozen petabytes spread across multiple clusters around the world, in different jurisdictions. We spent several months talking with the lawyers figuring that out. It was an interesting dance, because on the one hand we were quite confident that there was unlikely to be anything in the leftovers which was both meaningful and not migrated to the new platform, while on the other hand explaining that it wasn't practical to just "go and look" through a few dozen PB of data. I recall we ended up somewhere in between, coming up with ways to distinguish categories of data like caches and working data from various pipelines. It added over six months to the project, but was quite an interesting problem to work through that hadn't occurred to any of us earlier on, as we were thinking entirely in technical terms about infrastructure migration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some fun math: according to some estimates there is 175 zettabytes of data worldwide. Assuming 20-terabyte harddrives, this could be stored on 8.8 billion drives. Assuming 10 drives per rack unit, 42 RU per rack cabinet, 16 square feet per cabinet (including aisle space), that means you need about 330 million square feet of data center space to host this data. If it was hosted in a single square data center, it would be 3.5 miles long and wide. (I always like to picture the physical space something would occupy.) And energy wise, assuming 5 watts per drive, it would consume 44 gigawatt, so it could be powered by about two large hydro dams similar to the Three Gorges Dam (22 gigawatts capacity). I am assuming a PUE close to 1.0 for simplicity. Of course one would not be able to spin up all these drives at once, since a drive spinning up consumes about three times more power (15 watts). So you would definitely staggered spin up when booting the servers :-)If 90% of this data is "crap" and could be cut down, it would still be just a drop in the bucket compared to worldwide energy use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great coverage, however it failed to mention code review and artifact signing as well as full source bootstrapping which are fundamental defenses most distros skip.In our distro, Stagex, our threat model assumes at least one maintainer, sysadmin, or computer is compromised at all times.This has resulted in some specific design choices and practices:- 100% deterministic, hermetic, reproducible- full source bootstrapped from 180 bytes of human-auditable machine code- all commits signed by authors- all reviews signed by reviewers- all released artifacts are multi-party reproduced and signed- fully OCI (container) native all the way down "FROM scratch"- All packages easily hash-locked to give downstream software easy determinism as wellThis all goes well beyond the tactics used in Nix and Guix.As far as we know, Stagex is the only distro designed to strictly distrust maintainers.https://stagex.tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The OpenSSH project is careful about not taking on unnecessary dependencies, but Debian was not as careful. That distribution patched sshd to link against libsystemd, which in turn linked against a variety of compression packages, including xz's liblzma. Debian's relaxing of sshd's dependency posture was a key enabler for the attack, as well as the reason its impact was limited to Debian-based systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, avoiding other distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, and NixOS.Does Fedora use Debian's patch set for sshd, or a similar patch set that adds libsystemd?Edit: It looks like Fedora wasn't affected because the backdoor triggered a valgrind test failure, so they shipped it with a flag that disabled the functionality that was backdoored. Seems like they lucked out. https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very suspicious article. Sounds like the "nothing to see here folks, move along" school of security.Reproducibility is more like a security smell; a symptom you’re doing things right. Determinism is the correct target and subtly different.The focus on supply chain is a distraction, a variant of The “trusting trust” attack Ken Thompson described in 1984 is still among the most elegant and devastating. Infected development toolchains can spread horizontally to “secure” builds.Just because it’s open doesn’t mean anyone’s been watching closely. "50 years of security"? Important pillars of OSS have been touched by thousands of contributors with varying levels of oversight. Many commits predate strong code-signing or provenance tracking. If a compiler was compromised at any point, everything it compiled—including future versions of itself—could carry that compromise forward invisibly. This includes even "cleanroom" rebuilds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43614199</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; According to the White House, the number was erroneously saved during a “contact suggestion update” by Waltz’s iPhone, which one person described as the function where an iPhone algorithm adds a previously unknown number to an existing contact that it detects may be related.Politics aside, these auto-suggestions are a landmine in business contexts and should be disabled by IT where possible. Sometimes I'll be sending emails including both my client and internal team and the lawyers for the other side. The phone will decade that these email addresses are related in some way. So next time I want to send an internal strategy email to my client and the team, the app will helpfully suggest copying opposing counsel. Not great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surely the real question is why they were using Signal, rather than a secure government network?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; According to the White House, the number was erroneously saved during a “contact suggestion update” by Waltz’s iPhone, which one person described as the function where an iPhone algorithm adds a previously unknown number to an existing contact that it detects may be related.It's interesting that this was the cause. I'm sure we all have our own stories of how UI/UX niggles (regardless of platform or app) have led to unintended behavior.While I understand automatic suggestions can be helpful at times, when the UX doesn't clearly identify the cues that lead to the suggestion, with a way for a human to confirm it, this type of error is a likely result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601213</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "hasochism," which refers to a form of programming and reasoning that embraces the use of high-level abstractions while still engaging with low-level details. The author explores how this approach allows for a more manageable way of handling complex systems by combining rigorous mathematical frameworks and practical programming techniques. The paper delves into the implications of hasochism for software development, particularly in the context of functional programming and type systems, ultimately advocating for a deeper understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of programming.&lt;/p&gt;

As the PDP1 doesn't have take-up it is pretty trivial to make at 'historic' speeds.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a rather sizable collection of 1980s home computers with over a hundred different models (virtually all of the Ataris, Amigas, Apples, 
Commodores, Radio Shacks, Sinclairs, Amstrads, Dragons, MSX machines, etc). I started collecting them in the early 90s when most were less than $5 at thrift stores and I'd stopped collecting by the year 2000 because I basically had them all.Collecting back when they were considered basically worthless junk by most people meant I paid no more than $30 for any one machine and most were actually given to me for free or shipping cost. I do have an Interact but it's one of the few I've never booted up as I never had one back in the day and being so obscure it wasn't one of the computers I lusted after but couldn't afford in the 80s. This article has inspired me to dig it out and fire it up. I heard from someone a few years back that apparently Interacts are quite valuable now due to their rarity (not that I'm in the market to sell any of mine).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still have the Troll Hole Adventure on tape, along with the Interact that I learned programming on (MS basic! and machine code - we didn't have an assembler).As I recall, you don't flick the lighter you "flick bic" as was the marketing slogan at the time. The response would rhyme "flick bic" lead to "lamps lit". Other exciting things were using the paper tube from the bathroom and the lenses from somewhere else to "make telescope" which allowed you to read a distant sign or billboard.... Fun times.Oh right, there's a shovel and if you "dig frog" the response was "I can dig it" because you know... the 1970's...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Trinity (I'd call them 2nd generation home computers with a screen and keyboard as opposed to 1st gen like the Altair that had a front panel and/or attached to a terminal) were easy to beat in terms of cost by third generation computers (TRS-80 Color Computer, VIC-20, Atari 400, ...) were based on ASIC for glue instead of the discrete logic used in the 2nd gen.Modern attempts to build retrocomputers run into trouble being authentic because production runs are too small to justify an ASIC so they wind up using an FPGA or ESP32 for a display controller.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43614081</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The obvious methodology at work here is 'fire everyone then hopefully re-hire only what is blindingly obviously needed'. There are many, many problems with this approach in a business setting but even more from a governmental setting. The first, and what should be obvious to anyone with an ounce of empathy, is that these are real people who's lives are being toyed with. It isn't like you are trying out a new business process. You are literally playing with entire lives here as if they are disposable things. This alone makes what is happening inhumane. Even if it did make things more 'efficient' I would rather a humane government than whatever efficient government they are aiming for here. The second incredibly obvious reason why this is wrong is because this isn't a business. Money isn't the point. Let me repeat this one more time. Money is not the point of a government. I can't understand any argument about government efficiency that only looks at money. It is about total benefit to society, period. If you hire someone that is 'breakeven' in what they produce vs consume from a pure production point of view you could argue that for a business they should go, but from a government point of view you have employed someone and that person is churning the rest of the economy and society has one less drain. In other words all of society is way better off with that breakeven, or even net negative, person employed in government. In other words, an efficient government actually can have what would be considered waste in a corporate world and that is not only OK, but the right answer. I know of several people that are 'employed' but net negatives and society is way better off with that arrangement than having them on the streets. Is there a place for money/efficiency discussions in government? Sure, but if it is the only thing you look at then you really need to re-think things. There are many, many other ways this is morally and economically wrong but those are my top two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general it is a good practice to assume other parties are making a good faith effort, but after so many obvious cockups, that grace has been exhausted.My assumption is that there is a lot of blow-back so they are restoring a few high profile names so they can say, "see, we aren't stopping science!". It is good this handful of people are back on the job, but I assume the NIH is like most other organizations -- the top name isn't doing the work themselves. They lead a team of people and their expertise is used to provide them direction and as a resource to help analyze surprising results. If the top experts lose their staff, I doubt they'll get nearly as much done. Having the 65 year old braintrust spending hours pipetting and staining samples is wildly inefficient. DOGI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any proof that they're coding errors? A simpler explanation, to me at least, is that they first blanket fired people by dubious criteria, and are now using this as an excuse to backpedal when they realize they've cut something important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606315</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the resurgence of the dire wolf, a prehistoric species that once roamed North America. It highlights recent scientific advancements and discoveries that have reignited interest in this ancient predator, including genetic research and paleontological findings. The piece explores the implications of bringing back such a species through de-extinction efforts, touching on ecological, ethical, and social considerations surrounding the process. It reflects on how the dire wolf's return could reshape our understanding of extinction and biodiversity in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's ethical, but I hate that it's fakehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_wolf#DNA_evidence Look at this caldogram and text&gt; The sequences indicate the dire wolf to be a highly divergent lineage which last shared a most recent common ancestor with the wolf-like canines 5.7 million years ago. The study also measured numerous dire wolf and gray wolf skeletal samples that showed their morphologies to be highly similar, which had led to the theory that the dire wolf and the gray wolf had a close evolutionary relationship. The morphological similarity between dire wolves and gray wolves was concluded to be due to convergent evolution. Members of the wolf-like canines are known to hybridize with each other but the study could find no indication of genetic admixture from the five dire wolf samples with extant North American gray wolves and coyotes nor their common ancestor. This finding indicates that the wolf and coyote lineages evolved in isolation from the dire wolf lineage.There are a lot of extant species that are as closely related as the wolf. Cheating based on phenotype sucks. We want real genetic diversity!Best case, the female wolves they just just made are suitable mothers for the next round of hybrids, so they converge over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's[0] a recent editorial about Colossal, the company behind this.Basically, they make some flimsy claims about conservation and combating climate change to justify creating a poor imitation of Jurassic Park. Naturally, there's some real moral dilemmas that they gloss over in pursuit of the money a few wealthy people will pay to be able to say "I saw a Mammoth!"[0]: https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/editorial-mammoth-de...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be neat if they opened a theme park on a remote island filled with de-extinct creatures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43609661</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an anagram solver tool that allows users to input words or phrases to generate a list of possible anagrams. It features a user-friendly interface where users can easily enter their text and view the results, which display all the valid anagrams that can be formed from the given input. The tool aims to assist with word games, puzzles, and other language-related activities, enhancing creativity and vocabulary skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a cool game; I love it!After spending a few minutes playing it, I came out with the feedback below:  It would be nice if you added some sound effects for "hits" and "misses".

  For better dynamics, consider varying the words length. It appears to me that you are serving only words with five letters.

  It appears that you are having a bug that prevents the game from running smoothly on the following browsers: Firefox (Windows) and Brave (Windows/Android). I tried other browsers/OSes and the game was running perfectly: Chrome/Edge (Windows), Safari (iOS) and Firefox (Android). Apparently, the script at "https://cloud.umami.is/script.js" is not being loaded which causes an exception to happen when you lose; this prevents the game to show "Try Again" and the screen goes blank instead where you have to refresh the page to play again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice if it showed you something when it ended instead of just having the page go blank. . .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a fun game. I made an anagram game myself a few years ago.https://conundrum.fun/Seeing some of the other comments reminded me that most of the work went into trimming the word lists so that it wasn't rude or randomly impossibly difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578444</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Quartz, a global business news organization that launched in 2012 and aimed to provide high-quality journalism with a focus on the digital audience. It highlights Quartz’s innovative approach to news delivery, including an engaging website design and a shift toward mobile storytelling, which contributed to its rapid growth and popularity. The piece also notes the challenges Quartz faced over the years, including economic pressures and changes in the media landscape, leading to its eventual acquisition by a larger company. Ultimately, the article reflects on Quartz's impact on the media industry and its legacy in redefining digital news consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quartz wasn't "destroyed" by cynicism; it collapsed due to its own financial unsustainability.Investors didn’t kill Quartz—they stopped subsidizing losses once it was clear Quartz couldn't become self-sufficient.The "cynical" narrative obscures Quartz’s fundamental flaw: lack of a viable business model.Calling Quartz a victim overlooks that it repeatedly failed commercially, despite many chances and significant investment.Ultimately, Quartz’s fate wasn't about cynicism, but about investors deciding to stop throwing money into a losing bet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing about that article surprises me regarding G/O but there is one point that Zach makes about his transaction that he is wrong about:"Thanks to G/O's stubborn insistence that it only wanted Quartz's assets and not the corporate entity"...this is not stubborn it's quite common and is absolutely the right thing to do for many companies interested in another business. If they buy your entity (stock transaction) it comes with all the legal liability.Zach probably doesn't understand how much more likely his deal was to close as an asset purchase rather than a stock purchase. A stock purchase comes with lots more diligence and legalese. If they are buying your stock they are buying all your baggage and potential legal matters, it requires a lot more work including a laundry list of representations by the seller. G/O did everyone a favor by sticking to an asset purchase and getting the deal done. that's where the positives end it seems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; it. In the subject line of his email announcing the deal, he spelled our name "Quarts," and that set the tone for the level of care in what he had bought.This little detail seems to sum up so much about this kind of acquisition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616604</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know Domino exceedingly well. I started working with it in '94, and continued with it in one form or another until 2021. My last gig with it  was even a Domino-based SaaS that reached over 8 figures ARR, and is still up and running. Everything in this post sounds completely accurate. Domino is absolutely a viable platform from the back-end, database perspective.But that is not the important point when deciding whether to use it, because it is absolutely not a viable platform from the "Can you find a team to actually code on this platform?" perspective.By the time I had finished with that last gig, I told everyone the same thing: That I personally knew both Domino and modern web frameworks and could blend them together to have a modern front-end on that back-end. But I figure there are a couple dozen people in the world who know both sides well enough to do so, because the industry moved on. The talent moved on. Or retired. Most of my work post-2009 was decommission projects.  At the same time, new frameworks have come to fruition since the 90s, so all the special features Domino has baked in just aren't that unique anymore. There are also almost no jobs in it, so no reason for people to learn it.At the end of the day, you cannot run a company on a tech stack where there is no talent pool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just yesterday, I put up a blog about tracking down a date / time bug in Domino / Notes:What happened on December 13, 2024? [1][1] https://bostick.github.io/blog/2025/04/what-happened/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First Lotus Domino gig in 1998 and worked with it for several years until SharePoint started competing in the same space and pushing out Domino seats. Interest in Domino was diminishing quickly, and the companies that were using it were trying to get rid of it. I miss the excitement of reading through the red books, and new issues of the yellow technical books that would come out for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606065</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Generative Adversarial Networks" presents a novel framework for generative models, where two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, engage in a game-theoretic process. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates whether data is real or generated. This adversarial approach allows the generator to improve its capacity to create realistic outputs over time, leading to high-quality data generation. The paper discusses the theoretical foundations of this mechanism, its implementation, and the potential applications in fields such as image generation, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised representation learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could quickly wire up one of the LLM APIs as an application-defined function using SQLite if you wanted to play around with the idea of very slow and expensive queries:https://sqlite.org/appfunc.htmlhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/data/sqlit...Maybe stick with the aggregate variety of function at first if you don't want any billing explosions. I'd probably begin with something like LLM_Summary() and LLM_Classify(). The summary could be an aggregate, and the classify could be a scalar. Being able to write a query like:  SELECT LLM_Summary(Comment)
  FROM Users
  WHERE datetime(Updated_At) &gt;= datetime('now', '-1 day');

Is more expedient than wiring up the equivalent code pile each time. The aggregation method's internals could handle hierarchical summarization, chunking, etc. Or, throw an error back to the user so they are forced to devise a more rational query.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is the implementation https://github.com/dsg-polymtl/flockmtl&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll try this at work tomorrow !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616241</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of nullability in programming, particularly in type systems. It highlights the challenges and common pitfalls related to null references, which can lead to runtime errors. The author emphasizes the importance of using type annotations and modifiers to indicate whether a variable can be null. Additionally, the piece provides an overview of different programming languages' approaches to nullability, advocating for strategies that enhance code safety and maintainability. The goal is to promote better coding practices by understanding and managing null values effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612211"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article puts scare quotes around "understand" etc. to try to head off critiques around the lack of precision or scientific language, but I think this is a really good example of where casual use of these terms can get pretty misleading.Because code LLMs have been trained on the syntactic form of the program and not its execution, it's not correct — even if the correlation between variable annotations and requested completions was perfect (which it's not) — to say that the model "understands nullability", because nullability means that under execution the variable in question can become null, which is not a state that it's possible for a model trained only on a million programs' syntax to "understand". You could get the same result if e.g. "Optional" means that the variable becomes poisonous and checking "&gt; 0" is eating it, and "!= None" is an antidote. Human programmers can understand nullability because they've hopefully run programs and understand the semantics of making something null.The paper could use precise, scientific language (e.g. "the presence of nullable annotation tokens correlates to activation of vectors corresponding to, and emission of, null-check tokens with high precision and accuracy") which would help us understand what we can rely on the LLM to do and what we can't. But it seems like there is some subconscious incentive to muddy how people see these models in the hopes that we start ascribing things to them that they aren't capable of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that is exciting in the text is an attempt to go away from describing whether LLM 'understands' which I would argue an ill posed question, but instead rephrase it in terms of something that can actually be measured.It would be good to list a few possible ways of interpreting 'understanding of code'. 
It could possibly include: 
1) Type inference for the result
2) nullability
3) runtime asymptotics
4) What the code does&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There seems to be a typo in OP's "Visualizing Our Results" - but things make perfect sense if red is non-nullable, green is nullable.I'd be really curious to see where the "attention" heads of the LLM look when evaluating the nullability of any given token. Does just it trust the Optional[int] return type signature of the function, or does it also skim through the function contents to understand whether that's correct?It's fascinating to me to think that the senior developer skillset of being able to skim through complicated code, mentally make note of different tokens of interest where assumptions may need to be double-checked, and unravel that cascade of assumptions to track down a bug, is something that LLMs already excel at.Sure, nullability is an example where static type checkers do well, and it makes the article a bit silly on its own... but there are all sorts of assumptions that aren't captured well by type systems. There's been a ton of focus on LLMs for code generation; I think that LLMs for debugging makes for a fascinating frontier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612211</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses philosopher Thomas Nagel's exploration of the concept of "the good" and its implications for ethics and human life. Nagel critiques traditional theories that attempt to define goodness in absolute terms, arguing instead for a more nuanced understanding that considers subjective and objective perspectives. He suggests that recognizing the complexity of human experience can lead to a richer and more meaningful interpretation of ethical living. The piece reflects on the importance of engaging with these philosophical inquiries in contemporary discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how, during the 1980s, software was often downloaded via television signals, a method that may seem outdated today. It discusses the technology behind this practice, notable companies involved, and the impact it had on early computing and software distribution. The piece reflects on the nostalgia of that era, illustrating how television served as a pioneering platform for software access before the internet became prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

It's interesting that this post says that where the author lives "someone can put up a 48-foot advertisement wherever they want".  From other things I read I got the impression that in some (maybe many) cities a reason they're not banned is because they provide revenue, since many are on land like road medians that are controlled by local government.  I'm not sure to what extent the designs themselves are reviewed but the ability to erect a billboard is regulated in such cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Alaska which has a billboard ban. And then I went to Florida for university, and while there was a lot of culture shock I really think that the in your face billboards everywhere where the biggest bit.Huge aggressive grabs for attention when you really should be paying attention to the road really should not be allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606371</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rising competition among airlines to create engaging and memorable safety videos that capture passengers' attention and enhance their safety message. It highlights how traditional safety briefings have evolved into creative productions that often incorporate humor, celebrity appearances, and cultural references. Airlines aim to differentiate themselves in a crowded market by using innovative storytelling techniques to not only inform passengers but also entertain them, ultimately contributing to a more positive flying experience. The piece examines the implications of this trend on passenger compliance and airline branding in an era where consumer attention is increasingly fleeting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently travelled on Ethiopian Airlines, whose safety video is a good mix between the 90s and someone's nephew who know how to edit videos.It very literally showed everything talked about happening inside an actual airplane. Masks actually deploying and dropping from the ceiling and people putting them on, etc.What was interesting for me was, it was the first time I saw _where_ under the seat the life jacket is and it made me realize that despite having watched 100s of these videos I actually never knew how to get the life jacket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite airline safety video of all time is ANA's "Kabuki", which (IMHO) strikes the right elements of being clear, informative, gorgeous, absurd and showcasing Japan all at the same time:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2IZP5NhaKMThey used to have a really good "behind the scenes" video for it as well, but I can only find this shortened version on online:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WCJRyHuXo4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the United video, in many scenes, the more interesting thing is the Rube Goldberg machine distraction, not the actual safety information they're supposed to be conveying.They even do split-screen to add in distraction, when they're trying to show something visually in the less-interesting window.  (Worst lesson ever mis-learned from TikTok.)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jep3RR2yEXADid they consciously decide that most people have heard the instructions many times, and the best the airline can hope for is that passengers pause and look up from their personal devices, and maybe subconsciously reactivate those neurons even the slightest bit... as better than nothing?Or did the creatives simply get carried away, and no one reined them in?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581549</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think this has anything to do with using AI for prep. 20 years ago I was interviewing candidates who had lied on their resume, knew some of the things that they'd written about, but had everything fall apart under a little more questioning of what exactly they'd done and why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep coming back to this phrase used in this post: "it was scary".Yeah, hiring is scary. Hiring is insanely expensive on all fronts. Firing people is difficult, it's expensive and legally exposing. Hiring the wrong person, allowing them access your systems and potentially exfiltrate your IP to them is a hazardous but  necessary venture.The thing is, none of these things really changed with AI. People have been lying about their experience for literally centuries. IMO the advent of AI-laden candidates is going to nudge the hiring process back to how we did it 10 years ago, with a good old fashioned face-to-face interview and whiteboard questions. This means a lot of things that we've grown accustomed to in the past 5 years is going to have to melt.- people are probably going to have to fly out for interviews, again.- awkward and/or neurodivergent people are going to have to learn social skills again.- And yeah, you guys, it's time to buy a suit.Companies should consider reverting to forking the upfront $13-1500 dollars for a set of plane tickets for their hiring team and rented conference rooms for a week. It's a whole lot cheaper than spending 50k because you hired the wrong person for half a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The guy had to invent “cool” scenarios because companies think they are Google and working in backend doing normal things won’t get you hired. One could easily have prepared the whole interview with AI without failing to explain details (like what data was being paginated) just by lying a bit more. Not lying on your actual knowledge but on what your previous jobs were about. E.g., I have used k8s in pet projects but not at work, but this job ad for a backend position asks knowledge about k8s, so I’ll put k8s as skill under my last job and invent a credible story that I can talk about based on my experience during my pet projects.I think the message here is: don’t ask for the moon, you are not Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577490</guid></item><item><title>46.

That one feature has caused me more grief than anything else in Excel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, news of the 1582 promulgation had not yet reached the developers of Lotus 1-2-3, so they assumed that 1900 (being a multiple of 4) was a leap year.Joel Spolsky mentions a more charitable take on this from Ed Fries:&gt; Lotus had to fit in 640K. That’s not a lot of memory. If you ignore 1900, you can figure out if a given year is a leap year just by looking to see if the rightmost two bits are zero. That’s really fast and easy. The Lotus guys probably figured it didn’t matter to be wrong for those two months way in the past.https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-rev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one that always bites me is Excel truncating the leading zero in US zip codes (they start with 0 in the Northeast US).

An amendment to any bill, other than a bill stating legislative
intent to make necessary statutory changes to implement the Budget
Bill, whether reported by a committee or offered by a Member, is not in
order when the amendment relates to a different subject than, is intended
to accomplish a different purpose than, or requires a title essentially
different than, the original bill."http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/rules/assembly_rules.pdfThat being said, it seems that typically nobody in the legislature ever cares to challenge it. I saw it happen for another bill this session too (an AI bill that became something about commercial fishing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something is mysterious?  ... IS corruption mysterious now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;~~This is kinda ridiculous, especially considering the bill wouldn’t even affect OpenAI itself (that would make it an ex post facto law) but just close the loophole for the future.~~ (edit: I misread)I say this as a user of AI, I’ve seen the nonprofit structure get abused way too much for my liking.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses the concept of variable duty cycle square waves in the context of controlling power to devices. It explains how adjusting the duty cycle of a square wave can modulate the amount of energy delivered, making it a useful approach for applications such as dimming lights or controlling motors. The article delves into the technical details of generating square waves, including circuit design considerations and practical examples of implementation. It emphasizes the flexibility and efficiency that variable duty cycles offer in various electronic projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others noted, merely switching back and forth between -1 and 1 will result in heavy aliasing. Also, since you can only switch from -1 to 1 at integer sample points, you won't be able to accurately generate frequencies that don't divide the sample rate evenly. E.g. if your sample rate is 48 kHz, you won't be able to generate a 50% duty cycle 11 kHz square wave. Either the duty cycle, or the frequency will be different. Like, audibly different.The proper way is either via the Fourier series; or look into BLIT [1] synthesis.[1] https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~stilti/papers/blit.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The given examples seem disconnected from the duty cycle radios on my browser.  I mean changing them changes the sound, but it's as if the one I selected is not the one playing.Anyway, what could have been the purpose for the gameboy hardware to provide both 25% and 75% duty cycle?  In audio, these sound identical to a human, no?  They are the same waveform with inverted polarity.  They have the same overtone content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm also working on a gameboy inspired music app! (for Android, in Rust)If you use a perfect square wave, the aliasing is extremely audible and sounds terrible.As far as I can tell, in native everyone uses a nifty algorithm called bank-limited audio synthesis, and specifically blargg's implementation blip_buf.https://slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/If I were OP I'd try to compile the rust port of this library to WASM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613180</guid></item><item><title>1.

It's pretty by default, it allows us to mount/calculate the declarative spec for the graphs in the back-end and then only send the desired spec to the front-end so it can render, and it's also extremely flexible to the point we can support everything that traditional BI tools can do.We've never had to extend the lib to do anything new, everything we need is already there.Glad to see this great piece of work on top of HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll toss some props to `go-echarts` [1], which allows you to declare charts with Golang types and it all gets bound to JSON automagically by Golang's JSON marshaller.  I've used it for many projects and whenever there's an issue/PR, the maintainer responds quickly.It's fun to Go-embed JavaScript functions and SQL queries, for this weird blend of data, SQL, Go and Javascript.  Here's a Golang example that pulls data from a DuckDB and creates a baked-in candlestick chart file with JavaScript tooltips. [2][1] https://github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts[2] https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-duckduck-goose/blob/mai...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECharts is in my opinion the best out there. It surprisingly doesn't come up in a lot of lists or search for charting libraries. I've tried them all: chart.js, google charts, amCharts, Highcharts, ApexCharts. We use it in our tool/library https://docs.chartsql.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624220</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses innovative breakthroughs in image analysis, particularly focusing on the insights gained from the No Elephants project, which employs machine learning techniques to dissect and better understand images. It highlights how these advances can improve various applications, including wildlife conservation and data interpretation, by accurately identifying patterns and enhancing the ability to process visual information. The piece emphasizes the importance of technology in facilitating deeper connections with visual data, showcasing its potential to drive meaningful change in multiple fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a before/after moment for image generation. A simple example is the background images on a ton of (mediocre) music youtube channels. They almost all use AI generated images that are full of nonsense the closer you look. Jazz channels will feature coffee shops with garbled text on the menu and furniture blending together. I bet all of that disappears over the next few months.On another note, and perhaps others are feeling similarly, but I am finding myself surprised at how little use I have for this stuff, LLMs included. If, ten years ago, you told me I would have access to tools like this, I'm sure I would have responded with a never ending stream of ideas and excitement. But now that they're here, I just sort of poke at it for a minute and carry on with my day.Maybe it's the unreliability on all fronts, I don't know. I ask a lot of programming questions and appreciate some of the autocomplete in vscode, but I know I'm not anywhere close to taking full advantage of what these systems can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is circumstantial evidence out there that 4o image manipulation isn't done within the 4o image generator in one shot but is a workflow done by an agentic system. Meaning this, user inputs prompt "create an image with no elephants in the room" &gt; prompt goes to an llm which preprocesses the human prompt &gt; outputs a a prompt that it knows works withing this image generator well &gt; create an image of a room &gt; and that llm processed prompt is sent to the image generator.  Same happens with edits but a lot more complicated, meaning function calling tools are involved with many layers of edits being done behind the scenes.  Try it yourself, take an image, send it it, and have the 4o edit it for you in some way, then ask it to edit again, and again, and so on.  you will notice noticeable sepia filter being applied every edit, and the image ends up more and more sepia toned with more edits.  This is because in the workflow that is one of the steps that is naively applied without consideration of multi edit possibility.  If this was a one shot solution where editing is done within 4o image model by itself, the sepia problem wouldn't be there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the example where the coffee table is swapped, I notice every time the image is reprocessed it mutates, based on the previous iteration, and objects become more bizarre each time, like chinese whispers.* The weird-ass basket decoration on the table originally has some big chain links (maybe anchor chain, to keep the theme with the beach painting). By the third version, they're leathery and are merging with the basket.* The candelabra light on the wall, with branch decorations, turns into a sort of skinny minimalist gold stag head, and then just a branch.* The small table in the background gradually loses one of its three legs, and ends up defying gravity.* The freaky green lamps in the window become at first more regular, then turn into topiary.* Making the carpet less faded turns up the saturation on everything else, too, including the wood the table is made from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43590569</guid></item><item><title>3.

Also, I'm still making all the puzzles!HN provided the first real infusion of players that weren't my mom's friends. So thanks everyone.FWIW The Atlantic's team is amazing and got this live exactly 2 weeks from when we signed the deal.This happened quick and I feel very lucky. The HN community of solvers keeps me honest with much helpful technical and editorial feedback. I love it all -- here or at mayor@bracket.cityT[Tom who befriended a volleyball] HNPS my original post! https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43160542&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re: many comments: The puzzle (as I think of it) is NOT to get the top-level answer. The puzzle is to get all the answers. If you figure out an outer answer earlier, that acts as a clue for an inner answer, just as inner answers act as clues for outer answers. A crossword isn't speedrun by just filling in the bottom-rightmost word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really fun and clever! Super super creative. Congratulations!! I just love it when somebody comes up with a new idea like this, it's inspiring.My only nitpick: I totally get that you have to solve the inner clues before solving an outer clue, and that outer clues can help you solve an inner clue.BUT, the ergonomics/UX of that is just impossible... There was an inner clue that was super-stumping me, and I could solve "downwards" from like 5 clues above, but trying to keep track of which brackets were which and which level was which was maddening.It really feels like it needs a way to answer outer clues even if it won't collapse them. Just to keep track of them. And then a better way of tracking so many levels of nesting. I don't know if the answer is indented nesting like in code, or what. But the current UX only effectively allows you to work inside-out, when outside-in is clearly a necessary piece of the puzzle, because sometimes you get inner clues that are just stumpers that you have no other way of figuring out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622719</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;Brazil's government-run payments system has surged in popularity, overshadowing traditional banking methods and private companies. The system, designed to facilitate rapid and secure transactions, has significantly improved financial inclusion by allowing more citizens access to banking services. It challenges established financial institutions, raising concerns about competition and regulatory oversight. The article discusses the implications of this shift for Brazil’s economy and the broader financial landscape in Latin America, highlighting the potential benefits and risks of a state-dominated payments ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been living in Brazil for the last 20 years.Pix revolutionised the way we transact in Brazil. I've used Pix to pay for things that cost only cents, and I have a friend who bought her house using Pix.  The system just works for any transfer amount. And it's so easy to use.Its speed is truly baffling, and so is its reliability. Never have I failed to make a Pix payment because of downtime. I never cease to be amazed by how fast money arrives in my Brazilian account when I make a withdrawal directly from my EUR wallet on Wise. I receive a push notification from my Brazilian bank before Wise finishes running the animation of confirmation of withdrawal. It's like magic.And it's so widespread that nowadays I don't even question whether someone accepts Pix. When I get in a taxi, no matter how old the driver is, it's certain that they take (and prefer) Pix.I've even had homeless people ask me for Pix instead of change on multiple occasions.Cryptocurrencies don't stand a chance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm thinking, maybe controversially, centralized national payment service like this should be government-run based on my experience with Alipay which is a digital payment service in China.Due to it's commercial origin, Alipay is filled with unwanted ads and traps. Almost every time I made a payment with it, a pop up prompts me to enlist their Ant Financial LOAN service either now, or being prompted for the same question again 30 days later (yep, not Yes or No, but Now or Later). It's just fucking ridiculous, I don't need a LOAN for a $400 projector, and I don't need a LOAN for a $4 hair cut (Xi should probably do something about it, really).I'm glad that at least people of Brazil don't have to suffer that kind of shit. At least their government-run program is better scrutinized and boring, thus more dependable, that's a good thing in my eyes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Pix has spiced up Brazil’s fusty banking sector, but it gives the central bank a worrying amount of powerI think a largely prefer a government-run payment system than an US company monopoly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620279</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research indicating that complex intelligence has evolved independently at least twice among vertebrate animals. It highlights two distinct lineages: one in mammals, particularly primates, and another in birds, notably corvids and parrots. The study emphasizes the evolutionary adaptations that led to enhanced cognitive abilities in these groups, driven by social living and environmental challenges. It also examines the implications of this dual evolution of intelligence for understanding the nature of cognition and the brain across different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619548"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting to think of how bird intelligence is related to their perspective. Perching high in branches and taking to the skies allows them to see a large overview of the many activities of other life forms. They can manage to get relatively safe vantage points and just watch. The better they get at predicting what the low animals on the surface are doing, the more opportunities that they have to sneak in and sneak out safely to get a meal. Being stuck on the surface as a mammal means a more immediate, limited-scope, fight-or-flight reaction dominates daily activities, versus a game-board view of many interactions.Bird intelligence makes a lot more sense in that context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm guessing the reason birds' brains are so much smaller for a given level of intelligence is that there is so much more evolutionary pressure to make things lighter when you need to be able to fly. Mammals are likely more optimized for resilience and less caloric expenditure instead of weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus octopi, which evolved some degree of intelligence in a very different way than vertebrates. So we have at least three paths to intelligence now.This is an indication that fᵢ in the Drake Equation [1] is probably closer to 1 than 0.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619548</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a fan of TS and have been a paying customer for work infra for almost a year now. It really is well put together and easy to use, but I do run up against some issues/complaints when diving deep that I hope they can work out:* The pricing tiers and included features by tier penalizes you in frustrating ways. The base plan is a reasonable $6/user/m, but if you want to use ACLs to control anything in a workable way, it jumps 3x to $18/u/m. Better solutions are available for that kind of money, and I shudder to imagine what the next tier ('call us') costs.* Subnet routing broke on Ubuntu (maybe other distros) recently, and there were no alerts, communication from TS, or TS tools to pinpoint/figure out what was going on. I stumbled on a solution (install subnet router on a Windows box), and from there I searched and found others with that issue. Lost half a day in emergency mode over that!* Better tooling to determine why it's falling back to DERP instead of direct for remote clients. DERP relays should be an absolute last resort to provide connectivity for Business-plan-level customers (very slow), and the way TS works just assumes any connectivity is fine.Overall, the simplicity and abstraction of complex VPN networking is wonderful, but if you have issues or advanced needs, you are immediately thrust into the low-level UDP/NAT/STUN world you were trying to avoid. At that point, you're better off using a traditional VPN (WG, OpenVPN, or heaven forbid, IPSec), because it ends up being more straightforward (not easier) without the abstractions and easy-button stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got conflicted feels about Tailscale. I love their product and a bunch of the people I know use their free tier, including myself.But their enterprise strategy destroys their good will. I can only assume it's focused on killing old school VPN products. The free tier that we love is a marketing expense. And it’s not even a conversion play.People are complaining about ~10/user/month -- add basic things that you'd need to manage more than 10 peeps (SAML/SCIM support) and you're talking ~20/user/month. For us, a small sub 200 person company, they immediately lost their chance. We have lots of problems in the security space, some we're willing to spend more than 20/user/month to solve. Legacy network access is not one of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I saw the new round, I was instantly worried about change in direction that will most likely come with this, and effectively drive away regular users from a tool that seems universally loved.Similar sentiment can be seen in the discussion from three years ago [1] when they raised $100M.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31259950&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620141</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how any program can be utilized as a shell for GitHub Actions by leveraging the capabilities of the `run` keyword within the YAML configuration files. It provides examples and insights on customizing workflows and enhancing automation by replacing the default shell with various programming languages or tools. The author emphasizes the flexibility this approach offers, allowing developers to tailor their CI/CD processes to their specific needs and preferences, ultimately leading to more efficient development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used this in the past to force bash to print every command it runs (using the -x flag) in the Actions workflow. This can be very helpful for debugging.https://github.com/jstrieb/just.sh/blob/2da1e2a3bfb51d583be0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One cool undocumented GitHub Actions trick I spotted at work was the ability to use wildcards to match repository_dispatch event names:    on:
      repository_dispatch:
        - security_scan
        - security_scan::*

Why would you want to do this?We centralize our release pipelines as it's the only way to force repositories through a defined reusable workflow (we don't want our product teams to have to maintain them).This allows us to dispatch an event like so:    {
      "event_type": "security_scan::$product_name::$version",
      "client_payload": {
        "field": "value"
      }
    }

Then it is far easier to identify which product and version a workflow is running when looking in the Actions tab of our central release repository.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience is that the less done in GitHub actions the better.I tend to prefer either:- Using a build-system (e.g. Make) to encode logic and just invoke that from GitHub Actions; or- Writing a small CLI program and then invoke that from GitHub ActionsIt's so much easier to debug this stuff locally than in CI.So an interesting trick, but I don't see where it would be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617493</guid></item><item><title>8.

In a single player derivative, I remember combing through tons of UScript, unrealscript, stanzas which went something like. "Do this, and if we're in multiplayer, do this too or instead."
The code was a messs, but again, good times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really interesting analysis of where the data lives… cutting 3-4 textures would save you more memory even in the 100k actor case, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600363</guid></item><item><title>9.

He works in biomedical lab research and has absolutely no use for LLMs, but everyone on his team had a great time using the corporate language model to help write amusing resignation letters as various personalities, pirate resignation, dinosaur resignation etc. I dont think anyone actually quit, but what a great way to absolutely nuke team moral!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve always been the kind of developer that aims to have more red lines than green ones in my diffs. I like writing libraries so we can create hundreds of integration tests declaratively. I’m the kind of developer that disappears for two days and comes back with a 10x speedup because I found two loop variables that should be switched.There is no place for me in this environment. I’d not that I couldn’t use the tools to make so much code, it’s that AI use makes the metric for success speed-to-production. The solution to bad code is more code. AI will never produce a deletion. Publish or perish has come for us and it’s sad. It makes me feel old just like my Python programming made the mainframe people feel old. I wonder what will make the AI developers feel old…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”I recently played through a game and after finishing it, read over the reviews.There was a brief period after launch where the game was heavily criticised for its use of AI assets. They removed some, but apparently not all (or more likely, people considered the game tainted and started claiming everything was AI)The (I believe) 4 person dev team used AI tools to keep up with the vast quantity of art they needed to produce for what was a very art heavy game.I can understand people with an existing method not wanting to change. And AI may not actually be a good fit for a lot of this stuff. But I feel like the real winners are going to be the people who do a lot more with a lot less out of sheer necessity to meet outrageous goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619759</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  See, I know that shipping end-user software - like the Tailwind compiler - if that software is written in an interpreted language - is fucking hard.This I don't get. This is interpreted code, most web backends integrate node, why not just ship a node module? Why in gods name ship bun.The whole web development scene has had some of the worst software engineering I've ever seen. With the exception of the Ruby scene, we have Tilt and Nokogiri for these types of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was hesitant to give tailwind a try, like most aging web developers I couldn't stand that it breaks the "cascading" part of CSS.But eventually I didn't have choice as I inherited a web app that has all of the newfangled build components that web apps come with.  I love that we're coming full circle back to MVC with server components.After getting used to it, I ended up liking Tailwind, mostly because it breaks the cascading part of CSS.  There are so many unique parts to webpages these days that I think it makes sense to keep the styles close to their components, as opposed to global cascading components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got a number of vanilla JS, HTML, CSS libraries that work only from within the browser, using the standard tags to include them.For me, not having a build-step means that, yes, I miss out on typescript, but the upsides are easier to read, easier debugging and lower cognitive burden during both writing and reading the application.It means I will never, like the author in the article, spend $X weeks, and then spend a further $Y dollars just to build something "modern".My "modern looking" applications are developed, and then tested, on a machine from 2010 (1st-gen i7) that has 16GB of RAM and oodles of slow spinning-rust disks, and it isn't painful at all.[1][1] It is, in fact, quite nice when I see a client use their system from their own PC and it's just a little bit snappier than I am used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615986</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of "Frankenstein laptops" in India, where tech enthusiasts and repair shops piece together usable laptops from discarded or broken parts. This trend highlights the challenges faced by many in India regarding access to affordable technology and the growing culture of electronics recycling and upcycling. It showcases the ingenuity of users who manage to create functional machines that meet their needs despite financial constraints, reflecting broader themes of sustainability and self-sufficiency in technology use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During my middle school days, we lived in a small town for a little while (read: A place where i was allowed to take my bicycle out onto the main road).After school, I used to spend a lot of time just hanging out around some TV and radio repair shops and just watched them work. They used to be friendly and gave me parts like spare motors, lights that were lying around from broken Walkmans they wouldn't repair. I took those motors and added to my bicycle as a "dynamo light" , built "wired RC car" etc ...Fast forward to a few years ago when i got into building racing drones, soldering certain tiny wires was difficult for me. I went to a nearby mobile repair shop to get that done and he was happy to help me out.I owe a lot of my curiosity and my knowledge today to these repair shops.It's not a good thing that our electronics are becoming less and less repairable these days. No wonder these repair shops are vanishing as the time progresses.The closest thing to that we have these days are makerspaces. At our local makerspace we encourage people try to fix their broken electronics instead of throwing them away. But I feel like there should be more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago, I wanted to add more RAM to a Lenovo laptop. I opened the thing, remove the RAM, and like a complete idiot, switched on the power without any RAM in the slot.The laptop refused to start.I took it to the Lenovo center and they said about 7-10 days and a minimum of Rs 10,000 (about $150 in those days).Since this was too much for an old laptop, I looked for alternatives. Someone suggested a repair shop in Nehru Place, New DelhiThis was tucked into the back of the basement of a big tower. A tiny 10x10 room filled with laptop partsThe guy at the counter looked at the laptop, opened it up, twisted some wires around, added another few wires, and the thing was working againTotal time: under 10 minutes.Total cost: Rs 200 - just about $2.5 today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's simple, the labour cost for repair is lower than the replacement cost, we also have people scavenging for valuables in landfills. As/When India will become rich enough, this will become uneconomical. Long term solution is to force companies to build products with repairability in mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618105</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "CYC," which refers to a large-scale project aimed at establishing a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that enables computers to understand and reason about the world like humans. It examines the history, goals, and methodologies of the CYC project, highlighting its significance in the fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation. The author critically assesses the challenges faced by CYC, including its complexity and the evolving nature of knowledge, while emphasizing its potential impact on the future of AI and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had the funny thought that this is exactly what a sentient AI would write "stop looking here, there is nothing to see, move along." :-)I (like vannevar apparently) didn't feel Cyc was going anywhere useful, there were ideas there, but not coherent enough to form a credible basis for even a hypothesis of how a system could be constructed that would embody them.I was pretty impressed by McCarthy's blocks world demo, later he and a student formalized some of the rules for creating 'context'[1] for AI to operate within, I continue to think that will be crucial to solving some of the mess that LLMs create.For example, the early failures of LLMs suggesting that you could make salad crunchy by adding rocks was a classic context failure, data from the context of 'humor' and data from the context of 'recipes' intertwined. Because existing models have no context during training, there is nothing in the model that 'tunes' the output based on context. And you get rocks in your salad.[1] https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;d...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if it's possible to design a new formal language (something like lojban [1], with a grammar strictly based on formal logic) but with better UX so that it can be used by regular folks like me? Maybe combine something like Attempto [2] with a dedicated visual UI?I would think a language like that could speed up knowledge base construction. Maybe it can also serve as a substitute for natural languages in some situations where we want our communication to be logically airtight.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempto_Controlled_EnglishOn a separate note, I've always wondered how Cyc is pronounced. Is it "sike", or is it "see-why-see"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very interesting and worthwhile article (better than the comments here would suggest). However, I find it a bit of a pity that the author places so much emphasis on the assumption that the project has failed. The approach has not simply failed because the search for a solution has been going on for forty years. It took even more than forty years and costed at least as much before neural networks became really useful, and nobody would claim that the project failed because of that. And today's LLM are not really that intelligent yet. Maybe Cycorp's knowledge base will be made generally accessible at some point, so that it can be used to train LLMs. Perhaps then a greater benefit of this data will become apparent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625474</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago there was a necklace discovered in Sweden [1], thought to be about 2000 years old it made international headlines. Then it made headlines again when analysis revealed it was a fake.Not saying this knife will turn out to be a fake but seeing "Experts will soon conduct a metallurgical analysis" makes me just that little bit hesitant.1) https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vast/unikt-jarnaldershalsb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the press in Poland wrote about this, I'll add a little context. According to the Muzeum Historii Ziemi Kamieńskiej's spokesperson, the knife is actually up to 3-2,8. They used the X-ray fluorescence method to come up with that number. The dating is being disputed, as it was rushed out after the discovery, and it's not like you can use carbon dating on metal. There's still chemical analysis to be done, but that doesn't give accurate results either. Some scientists point to the XVIII-XIX CE. Apparently some experts had a look at it and say it's from the Middle East, and if made of brass it could mean it's from I BCE, and it's been stylized to look ancient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a question. Who gets to own the dagger? The museum? Or the people who found it? What the general law around finding things like this and ownership?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615925</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of the CSS `text-wrap: pretty;` feature in WebKit, which enhances typography by improving how text wraps around other elements. This feature aims to create more visually appealing layouts by allowing text to flow smoothly around images and other content without breaking words awkwardly. It encourages designers to adopt this new option for a more refined and polished reading experience, highlighting the technical details and potential applications of the feature in modern web design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find myself laughing at "Many developers are understandably concerned about the performance of text-wrap: pretty."  I just can't bring myself to believe there is a meaningfully sized group of developers that have considered the performance of text-wrapping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m pretty excited for this to be added to ereaders, which notoriously (among people who care about this kind of thing) have terrible layout engines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Far to little effort and attention has been devoted to creating beautiful text online. The web set text back centuries. In some ways it was never this bad except for the monospaced typewriters. This is welcome indeed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622703</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search is primarily a portal - you know a particular resource exists, you just don't know its exact URL.You hear about this new programming language called "Frob", and you assume it must have a website. So you google "Frob language". You hear that there was a plane crash in DC, and assume (CNN/AP/your_favorite_news_site) has almost certainly written an article about it. You google "DC plane crash."LLMs aren't ever going to replace search for that use case, simply because they're never going to be as convenient.Where LLMs will take over from search is when it comes to open-ended research - where you don't know in advance where you're going or what you're going to find. I don't really have frequent use cases of this sort, but depending on your occupation it might revolutionize your daily work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still prefer tranditional search engines over LLMs but I admit, its results feels worse than it has traditionally.I don't like LLMs for two reasons:* I can't really get a feel for the veracity of the information without double checking it. A lot of context I get from just reading results from a traditional search engine is lost when I get an answer from a LLM. I find it somewhat uncomfortable to just accept the answer, and if I have to double check it anyways, the LLM's answer is kind of meaningless and I might as well use a traditional search engine.* I'm missing out on learning opertunities that I would usually get otherwise by reading or skimming through a larger document trying to find the answer. I appreciate that I skim through a lot of documentation on a regular basis and can recall things that I just happened to read when looking for a solution for another problem. I would hate it if an LLM would drop random tidbits of information when I was looking for concrete answers, but since its a side effect of my information gathering process, I like it.If I were to use an AI assistant that could help me search and curate the results, instead of trying to answer my question directly. Hopefully in a more sleek way than Perplexity does with its sources feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People keep saying this but I keep using Google and I keep being happy with my results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619768</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My Master's supervisor, at Wits university in Johannesburg, worked on the architecture of the 360 after graduating from the PhD program at Harvard. I remember him telling us how they went about deciding whether or not 32 bits would be a sufficient size for "most" floating point numbers. They were very systematic about it, scouring journals, talking with physicists and mathematicians and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL that not only the software side was chaotic (served as the backdrop of Fred Brook's "Mythical Man Month"), but also the hardware side almost failed.the article here ends around 1971 --- the mainframe would later save IBM again, twice, once when they replaced aluminum with copper in interconnects, and then when some crazy IBM Fellow had a team port Linux to s390.  Which marked the birth of "enterprise Linux", i.e. Linux running the data centre, for real.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This whole thing is very cool and worth reading.BUT. I worked at a place that used IBM 360s. We ran stuff for engineers, a lot of Fortran along with assembly code. We had so much stuff going on we could not code up and run things fast enough. The engineer/scientist got frustrated.Then one day an engineer brought in an Apple II from home and ran the programs on that.The earth shook. The very ground beneath us moved. Tectonic plates shifted. The world was never the same again! I think it was Visicalc.Later there were other things. Soul Of A New Machine. The Mac.I wonder how the compute power of a current high end smart phone compares with and IBM 360? I know the graphics chip is better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619229</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The project "coroot" on GitHub focuses on providing a comprehensive and user-friendly observability tool for cloud-native applications. It integrates metrics, logs, and traces to help developers and operators better understand application performance, troubleshoot issues, and enhance overall reliability. Key features include automated dependencyGraph visualizations, insights into performance bottlenecks, and real-time monitoring capabilities. The project's aim is to facilitate easier debugging and optimization of microservices architectures while promoting best practices in observability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great work! It's nice seeing another observability tool. Demo is neat and easy to navigate.Couple of questions:What's the overhead of tracing + logging observed by users? I see many tools being built on top of the OpenTelemetry eBPF tracer, which is nice to see.The OpenTelemetry eBPF tracer uses sampling to capture traces. Do other types of logging in the tool use sampling as well (HTTP traces)?When finding SLO violations, can this tool find the bug if the latency spikes do not happen frequently (ie, latency spikes happens every 5minutes - 1hour)? I'm curious if the team have had experienced such events and even if those pmax latencies matter to customers since it may not happen frequently.I see that the flamegraph is a CPU flamegraph - does off-cpu sampling matter (Disk/Network, etc...)? Or does the CPU flamegraph provide enough for developers to solve the issue?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked into eBPF-based observability tools for k8s some time ago and found at least four tools that look incredibly similar: Pixie, Parca, Coroot, and Odigos. There are probably others I missed too. Do you have any thoughts about this?From a user perspective, having several tools that overlap heavily but differ in subtle ways makes evaluation and adoption harder. It feels like if any two of these projects consolidated, they’d have a good shot at becoming the "default" eBPF observability solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took a cursory look and I like what I see – the service maps are really good, I love the level of detail. I will say, one thing I'm looking for with this kind of software, to maximise value, is structured logging support, and from what I could see, each log line just has the raw payload currently. Is that something you have on your roadmap?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43623820</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fundamentals of analytic combinatorics, focusing on a specific example to illustrate key concepts and techniques. It explains how generating functions can be utilized to analyze combinatorial structures, highlighting the connection between combinatorial objects and their generating functions. The author provides a detailed breakdown of the example, demonstrating methods to derive asymptotic estimates and analyze combinatorial growth rates, ultimately showcasing the power of analytic combinatorics in solving complex counting problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is only tangentially related, but one thing that I am still kind of hopeful about is analytic combinatorics will free us from the tyranny of asymptotic analysis.I suppose this is kind of a hot take, and in some ways less relevant than it was (say) 10 years ago, but I believe the theoretical CS community has spent a lot of time analyzing the performance of various algorithms over the years and kind of pointedly not inventing algorithms which accomplish some result at all, even if it is only known to be computable in a pathologically inefficient way. This means a lot of breakthroughs that could have been TCS breakthroughs have been invented, usually worse, by other communities.I am not the only one who thinks so, here[1] is an obscure talk where Michael Mitzenmacher (a well-known CS theory prof at Harvard) makes more or less this specific complaint.One of the nice things about Flajolet/Sedgewick[2] (mentioned in this post) is that it gives a nice set of combinators for (at least it seems to me, in theory) precisely enumerating how many "steps" an algorithm would take given some input. I optimistically imagine a world where we replace the relatively non-specific asymptotic bounds of an algorithm with a very specific quantification of the work an algorithm will take. And that this in turn would free TCS to focus on things that are more germane to the field as a whole.With that all said I'm open to the argument that TCS has fundamentally changed and this is no longer such a big issue. But perusing the various TCS conferences I sense it isn't.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3anjSAnKBo[2]: https://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/book.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool!What's meant by "it’s already too much to ask for a closed form for fibonacci numbers"? Binet's formula is usually called a closed form in my experience. Is "closed form" here supposed to mean "closed form we can evaluate without needing arbitrary-precision arithmetic"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What math lets you most easily be convinced you’ve come up with the right answer when you actually haven’t?Seems like combinatorics comes in second only to statistics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624293</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting.  I never used much IBM hardware, and always assumed that their terminals used EBCDIC and not ASCII.The HP 2648A terminal also had a "block mode", and the RTE screen editor used it.  It was one of the first screen editors I ever used (in 1984).

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Netflix uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to accurately attribute network flow logs for performance monitoring and troubleshooting. It highlights the challenges in identifying and analyzing data flow within their infrastructure and explains the implementation of eBPF to enhance observability. By utilizing eBPF, Netflix can collect detailed performance metrics and identify issues more efficiently, ultimately improving their streaming service's reliability and user experience. The piece emphasizes the importance of this technology in managing complex network environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At Coroot, we solve the same problem, but in a slightly different way. The traffic source is always a container (Kubernetes pod, systemd slice, etc.). The destination is initially identified as an IP:PORT pair, which, in the case of Kubernetes services, is often not the final destination. To address this, our agent also determines the actual destination by accessing the conntrack table at the eBPF level. Then, at the UI level, we match the actual destination with metadata about TCP listening sockets, effectively converting raw connections into container-to-container communications.The agent repo: https://github.com/coroot/coroot-node-agent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question to the Netflix folks: I saw a lot of in-house developed tools being quoted, do you guys have service mesh like linkerd ?Have you guys evaluated vendors like Kentik?I would love to get more insight into what do you guys actually do with flow logs? for example if I store 1 TB of flow logs, what value can I actually derive from them that justify the cost of collection, processing, and storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it necessary to rely on ip address attribution?  If FlowExporter uses ebpf and tcp tracepoints, could each workloads be placed in its own cgroup and could FlowExporter directly introspect which cgroup (and thus, workload) a given tcp socket event should be attributed to?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624888</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents "Neural Graffiti," an open-source project that combines neural networks with artistic expression, allowing users to create art by transforming images using deep learning techniques. It provides an overview of the project's features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines. The repository includes code samples, dependencies, and documentation to help users generate unique art pieces by leveraging algorithms that reinterpret images. The goal is to foster creativity and experimentation in the intersection of technology and art.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where x is the final hidden layer of the base model, the idea here is to steer outputs in some direction by adding a vector y. More specifically, y is an exponential moving average over a sequence of vectors W(z_t), where z_t are some sort of context vectors and W is a linear map.Except, the linear map W is just set to a random initialization, so it won't work for obvious reasons in its current form. (I guess this is why there is no example of its output. I'm guessing it was vibe-coded?) Also, since the intervention is only happening at the last hidden layer, I can't imagine this would really change how the model "thinks" in an interesting way. Like, yeah, you can absolutely make a model talk about dogs by adding in control vector for "dogness" somewhere.Basically, this method is "inspired by graffiti art of tagging and the neuroplastic nature of living brains" in the same way that taking an exponential moving average of a time series would be "informed by state-space dynamics techniques utilized in deep learning, reservoir computing, and quantum mechanics." Really tired of the amount of insincere/pointless language in deep learning nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Played with the demo a bit and I got confused.1. The chat context is always provided, and that introduces a bit of uncertainty - when the chat history mentioned something the model is always inclined to connect with it.2. When I tried to set each context to an empty string, the model doesn't show any evidence of remembering concepts. I told it 5 times that I love cats, and when asked about its favorite animal, its output remains "honeybee" and "octopus".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great, somebody reinvented control vectors.This industry needs to stop reinventing things every 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618339</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey! This guy is using the fancy new treelist [1] package which implements RRB trees. These are super cool data structures: a cache-friendly, multiway tree structure to store a sorted collection with O(log_{32} n) read, functional insert/update/append/prepend. Really a fantastic data structure for functional programming.[1]: https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/treelist.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mathy construction like in the article is probably important for the full conjecture, but isn't this concrete case just an instance of the bin-covering problem? Your discrete items are the log of each prime factor (included according to its multiplicity), set the lower threshold to log(100k), and if you get any solution with 300k or more factors, you can redistribute the extra factors arbitrarily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like how Tao put out the call, and you answered it. Very cool! I was waiting for someone on here with engineering and math chops to attempt devising a more efficient approach teased in that article. Super cool to see you do it! You might be co-author on his paper, I think that's what he said, hahaha ! :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624977</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep seeing people advocating that the idea that we should build everything, and every piece or everything, here is a good one. Why? Is this just an isolationist dream? The reductive, absurd, extreme of this is why don't individual people go out and build all their own stuff like cars and houses. Let's all go out and learn how to mine and refine metal ore so we can get started on building the family sedan! There is an argument for what the right balance is, and likely a good argument that at lest some minor capability should exist so we can keep re-assessing the value of that industry, but the notion that we should have it all in-house will just limit us to much more primitive tech since we can't gain the benefit of world wide innovation and build off of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And that's 30 years ago. It's worse now.The US isn't producing much manufacturing machinery.Machine tools last a long time, many decades. Replacement of worn-out machine tools does happen, but slowly. Because of this, the market for new machine tools is mostly driven by the growth rate of manufacturing, not the total level of manufacturing activity. If manufacturing is flat or in decline, new machine tool sales become rare. The US does have a big used machine tool market, and much demand is filled from there.China now makes quite good machine tools. (Plus many crappy ones.) Search Alibaba for "CNC mill". There are decent 3-axis machines below US$20,000, and 5-axis machines below $30,000. Haas, the biggest machine tool builder in the Western world, has almost nothing below $70,000.[1]As a rule of thumb, 10x the volume cuts manufactured product cost in half. It's hard to come back from being a small volume producer.[1] https://www.haascnc.com/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How’s basing the US economy on services looking now?My brother is an extremely skilled machinist, the sort who could build machine tools if he had the resources. And let me tell you there ain’t many of them, especially not young ones. Why? Because the US has emphasized college as the only respectable education path, as well as the only path to well paid jobs. That’s how you end up with a manufacturing industry full of lazy knuckleheads (and believe me I’ve got the stories to back this assertion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43588337</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "the uncanny valley" in artificial intelligence and robotics, which refers to the discomfort or eeriness that people feel when encountering humanoid robots that are almost but not quite lifelike. It explores the psychological implications of this phenomenon, the reasons behind our reactions to near-humans, and how it impacts the development of AI and robotics. The author analyzes various examples and offers insights into the design choices that can help mitigate the uncanny valley effect, ultimately aiming for a more acceptable interaction between humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;

If folks haven't seen it, Knuth's latest release looks at constraint satisfaction.  Really fun discussion on the relations between different ways to model this sort of problem.

Talk about how you can reframe a "real world" problem in terms of some puzzles we may have played as kids.  Invite us to play more as adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if anyone wants a "human" solution1) there are 4 questions that everyone answered the same way (let's say this earned everyone A points)2) in the rest of the questions, 7-point and 5-point students gave opposite answersthat means that 7-A (rest of 7-point student's correct answers) equals to 5-(4-A) (rest of 5-point student's incorrect answers)7-A = 1+A =&gt; A=3That means 3-point student scored 3 points together with everyone else, and answered rest of the questions wrongFrom this it's trivial to find the hidden score and why there are 4 possible answer keys&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625452</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by dicroce focuses on HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs, which are used for efficient nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The project includes an implementation of the HNSW algorithm, showcasing its effectiveness for large-scale data and offering features like customizable parameters to optimize performance. The repository provides installation instructions, usage examples, and detailed documentation for developers interested in utilizing HNSW in their applications. Overall, it serves as a resource for those looking to implement or learn more about this advanced search algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, HSNWs are not so complex, and they work great. I wrote an implementation myself, it's 2500 lines of code (5x the one of dicroce!), but inside there is binary and int8 quantization and many advanced features (include true deletions), and I commented it as much as possible. I hope you may find it useful to read alongside the one proposed by OP:https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/modules/vector-...Still, to be honest, I'm reading the 500 lines of code with great interest because I didn't thought it was possible to go so small, maybe part of the trick is that's in C++ and not in C, as for instance you don't have the queue code.Also the strategy used by my implementation in order to re-link the orphaned nodes upon deletion adds complexity, too. (btw any feedback on that part is especially appreciated)EDIT: Ok after carefully inspection this makes more sense :D1. Yes, C++ helps, the vector class, the priority queue, ...2. I forgot to say that I implemented serialization other than quantization, and this also includes quite some code.3. Support for threads is another complexity / code-size price to pay.And so forth. Ok, now it makes a lot of sense. Probably the 500 LOC implementation is a better first-exposure experience for newcomers. After accumulating all the "but how to..." questions, maybe my C implementation is a useful read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I particularly appreciated the concise and plain explanation of the data-structure, it really demystifies it.&gt; HNSW is a graph structure that consists of levels that are more sparsely populated at the top and more densely populated at the bottom. Nodes within a layer have connections to other nodes that are near them on the same level. When a node is inserted a random level is picked and the node is inserted there. It is also inserted into all levels beneath that level down to 0.&gt; When searches arrive they start at the top and search that level (following connections) until they find the closest node in the top level. The search then descends and keeps searching nearby nodes. As the search progresses the code keeps track of the K nearest nodes it has seen. Eventually it either finds the value OR it finds the closest value on level 0 and the K nearest nodes seen are returned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implementations like these are incredibly useful for understanding how something like HNSW works, and being able to make derivative work.I put together a tiny little implementation a while ago, the key thing being, it writes the index as a few parquet files, so you can host the index on a CDN and read from it via http range requests (e.g. via duckdb wasm).Definitely isn't beating any benchmarks, but free (or wildly cheap) to host, as you serve it directly from a CDN and processing is done locally.https://github.com/jasonjmcghee/portable-hnsw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43623099</guid></item><item><title>28.

The model doesn't look great. All the coverage I've seen has been negative.This is about what I expected, but it makes you wonder what they're going to do next. At this point it looks like they are falling behind the other open models, and made an ambitious bet on MoEs, without this paying off.Did Zuck push for the release? I'm sure they knew it wasn't ready yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's most illustrative to see the sample battles (H2H) that LMArena released [1].

Most you could bring up is browser data syncing, which there are other reasons to turn off anyhow if you don't trust the corporations.I don't know where is this even coming from though, the article doesn't address anything like this prior to the quoted bit.Kind of fair on the sensitive sessions thing, but only just kind of. If a system is sensitive, it should have a short keepalive in the first place. Blaming the user is not an effective security strategy, much like how saying "skill issue" is not an effective mitigation strategy for memory mgmt vulnerabilities of C code.Wild article though.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Brunel University found that saccharin, a common artificial sweetener, has surprising potential to combat antibiotic resistance. The study shows that saccharin can enhance the effectiveness of certain antibiotics against resistant bacterial strains, suggesting that it may be used as an adjunct therapy to improve treatment outcomes in infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens. This discovery opens new avenues for addressing the growing global health challenge of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed the world’s smallest pacemaker, which is roughly the size of a grain of rice. This innovative device, created using a miniaturized form of the existing technology, can potentially be implanted without the need for extensive surgical procedures. The small size allows it to address a wide range of heart rhythm problems, offering a less invasive and more efficient solution for patients. This breakthrough could significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with heart conditions by providing a more accessible and manageable way to regulate heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;

It has to be close to the heart so it’s probably not going into the bloodstream. And you can’t really inject something precisely into the heart itself while it is pumping, right? And do you just aim by hand or is there some apparatus that does the alignment so you hit a specific location and depth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has also been designed to dissolve into the body when no longer needed, sparing patients invasive surgery.More likely, it will just remain a (hopefully) inert embedded implant. If it has active electronics, and thus semiconductors, I doubt e.g. silicon will dissolve.Edit: care to refute?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be fair, that's a pretty huge grain of rice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43585911</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reasons why many companies fail to address and fix bugs in their software products effectively. It highlights factors such as prioritization of new features over bug fixes, lack of accountability, insufficient resources, and the challenge of reproducing issues. The author emphasizes that understanding the impact of bugs on user experience and business reputation is crucial for companies. Furthermore, the piece suggests that fostering a culture of quality and proactive communication can help organizations better manage and resolve software issues, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of the time, a lack of bugfixes comes from the incentive structure management has created. Specifically, you rarely get rewarded for fixing things. You get rewarded for shipping new things. In effect, you're punished for fixing things because that's time you're not shipping new things.Ownership is another one. For example, product teams who are responsible for shipping new things but support for existing things get increasingly pushed onto support teams. This is really a consequence of the same incentive structure.This is partially why I don't think that all subscription software is bad. The Adobe end of the spectrum is bad. The Jetbrains end is good. There is value in creating good, reliable software. If your only source of revenue is new sales then bugs are even less of a priority until it's so bad it makes your software virtually unusuable. And usually it took a long while to get there with many ignored warnings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't effective at a large org, but if you're running a small company/startup, just have an engineer "help out" with support every so often. We'd ask devs to run the support desk when the person was on vacation and also had a general rotation through.It's good for building customer empathy but also for helping the people who build the product understand how it's used. The intuition you build up from those experiences is very powerful.Also, about two hours into handling support tickets for the same issue, 99% of devs will just fix the problem. So you create a very elegant incentive structure for bugfixing that circumvents a lot of the traditional structural issues.Of course you can't do this in a big company, which is one of the structural disadvantages that come with size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally I've never found it a problem to just fix things that I see are broken, as a dev, without PM approval, even in very dysfunctional organizations. Sometimes it even goes noticed and people applaud you for it.In other words: though I acknowledge that the phenomenon described in the article is real, I sometimes feel it's just because developers accept a reality that doesn't need to be accepted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615346</guid></item><item><title>37.

It highlights the unique design and dimensions of the escalator, which stands out due to its reduced width compared to standard escalators.

This article is not about those people.The vast majority of North Koreans outside North Korea are not defectors, instead they are controlled state assets. There are no North Korean people outside the country that are free citizens. Every single North Korean authorised to leave the country is working directly for their government often to raise money for the regime, to steal IP, to infiltrate for some nefarious purpose.Having one of these North Korean active assets in your company is extremely dangerous, your business is now at risk of leaks, theft, or worst something being modified like added vulnerabilities that could be exploited later in cyber attacks.So no, this article is not racist at all and really has nothing to do with the recent political situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This part is genius:    &gt; Nowadays, Leggio told Fortune he won’t even set up an interview with a candidate who seems promising on paper unless they agree to one final step.

    “Say something negative about Kim Jong Un,” Leggio tells potential job candidates, referring to the third-generation authoritarian Supreme Leader of North Korea, officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Through research, Leggio learned insulting the DPRK’s Supreme Leader is forbidden, and North Korean citizens could face serious punishment for showing anything less than reverence.

    “The first time I ever did it, the person started freaking out and cursing,” said Leggio.

    The job seeker subsequently blocked Leggio across all social media platforms. Now Leggio makes the same request before every single interview. Other startups and founders he knows are asking the same thing of job seekers, he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My company accidently employed on for about 3 days until we realized what was happening and cut them loose.I recognize this was likely sourced from a PR agency working for a security product meant for global employee verification but I can attest they are addressing a real problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617352</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of using less htmx in web development to create more efficient and maintainable applications. It emphasizes the importance of simplifying code and reducing reliance on JavaScript libraries by leveraging standard HTML and server-rendered pages. The author argues that minimizing the use of htmx can lead to better performance, easier debugging, and a more straightforward development process. By focusing on essential functionalities and avoiding complexity, developers can create cleaner and more effective web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is amazing how quickly a simple, traditional, "collection of pages" type website actually works if you don't do annoying things to slow it down. Most websites would be absolutely fine if a) HTTP was used reasonably well to set things like cache headers, and so (as mentioned in the article) and b) if a load of user-irrelevant stuff like tracking and advertising code wasn't thrown in as well. A simple page with standard HTML, passably optimised assets where needed, and only the JS needed for actual functionality, should be almost instant on most modern connections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Like any new tool, especially a tool that got popular as quickly as htmx, there are differing schools of thought on how best to use it. My approach—which I believe necessary to achieve the results described above—requires you to internalize something that htmx certainly hints at, but doesn’t enforce: use plain HTML wherever possible.That’s the path for ultimate long term functional web pages!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two sides to the argument which I think should be treated separately: a) Is it a good idea overall? and b) is htmx implementation good enough?a) I think so, yes. I've seen much more spa that have a completely broken page navigation. This approach does not fit all use cases, but if you remember that the whole idea of htmx is that you rely on webserver giving you page updates as opposed to having a thick js app rendering it all the way it makes sense. And yes, js libraries should be wrapped to function properly in many cases, but you would do the same with no react-native components in any react app for exampleb) I don't think so. htmx boost functionality is an afterthought and it will always be like this. Compare it with turbo [1] where this is a core feature and the approach is to use turbo together with stimulus.js which gives you automagical component life cycle management. Turbo still has it's pains (my favorite gh issue [2]), but otherwise it works fine[1]: https://turbo.hotwired.dev/

&lt;p&gt;A report highlights that solar power has significantly increased its contribution to global electricity generation, reaching 40% of clean electricity. The growth of solar energy is characterized as an "unstoppable force," driven by advancements in technology, decreasing costs, and government policies promoting renewable energy. This expansion underscores the transition towards sustainable energy sources, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The report emphasizes the vital role of solar power in achieving future energy goals and ensuring a greener planet.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to track down the source of this figure. I see that the global "photovoltaic (PV) capacity" is at 6.6% (according to a trade organization that represents manufacturers of solar panels). I don't see a definition for "PV capacity", but I assume it means the total theoretical output of all installed solar panels, even if the output is much lower (due to panels being sub-optimally located, aligned, or having degraded over time).I'd love to be proven wrong, but I'm just not buying the 7% figure as the evidence stands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620007</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The website highlights the concept of blackout poetry, an art form where individuals create poems by redacting words from existing texts, typically using a marker to obscure the unselected words. It provides an overview of techniques and inspiration for crafting blackout poetry, encouraging creativity and personal expression through the transformation of pre-existing material into new poetic forms. The site likely includes examples and possibly prompts to inspire visitors to engage in this unique artistic practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the emergence of a unique ecosystem in Oahu, Hawaii, referred to as a "freakosystem," which has been unintentionally created by human activities. It highlights how the introduction of non-native species and habitat modification has led to unexpected biological interactions and biodiversity that are distinct from the traditional Hawaiian environment. The piece discusses the implications of this new ecosystem, including potential benefits and challenges for conservation efforts, and raises questions about the impact of human influence on natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's always odd to me how people tend to think that human-created ecosystems are "freakish" or "unnatural".Humans evolved in the same environment as the ecosystems we're modifying. The buildings and cars and roads we make are made of materials we find on earth, similar to how birds build nests or ants make anthills. (Whether all the things we build are good and healthy for us and our environment is another story.)My hypothesis has long been that this view of human activity as "unnatural" was actually born of the religious perspective that some religions hold that humans were implanted into the universe from the outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; O'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degradedThe entire article presumes that novelty is a degradation -- yet offers no evidence for it. So it's just an article of faith that whatever series of major evolutionary catastrophes led to to an ecology are morally or aesthetically preferable to those of human design and intention?This disneyification of nature is a great stupidity. Nature is just a series of major crises, punctuated by periods with some novelty -- that this process should be preferable to any other, reads quite implausibly to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re interested in this, the garden below is very worth visiting.https://ntbg.org/gardens/limahuliIt’s built into sections - plants from before any humans landed in Hawaii, plants from early settlers, plants from the plantation period, etc.My favorite learning was canoe plants (maybe a different name) - plants that early settlers would bring with them when exploring new islands in their canoe that were critical to their survival. They provided food, medicine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580480</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Git Matcher is a platform designed to connect developers and companies by matching job seekers with relevant tech job opportunities based on their skills and preferences. Users can create profiles showcasing their expertise, while employers can post job openings, making it easier to find suitable candidates. The site aims to streamline the recruitment process in the tech industry by leveraging algorithms that facilitate better connections based on individual qualifications and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GitHub profile is not a CV.A few things that immediately jumped at me:- Not all code is on GitHub and not all of it is public. Recently I see more and more code moving elsewhere: GitLab (both managed and self-hosted), Codeberg, Forgejo instances.- Even the code that is on GH might live outside of personal profile. Many notable FLOSS projects have their own organisations on GH. People who produce a lot of that code have direct commit access and don’t keep forks on their profiles. You’re missing all of the most prolific developers here.- Location field in a GH profile is full of jokes. Search for “space”, “internet”, “/dev/null”, etc.- It picks top repos weirdly. I tried to find my profile. It picked one repo that is not in my profile and wasn’t there probably for a long time, and another that is a public archive and hasn’t been updated since 2017. Both are forks with minimal contributions on my part. I have pinned repos in my profile that are much fresher and, arguably, more relevant.But the project looks sleek. Probably helpful in addition to Linkedin and whatever to uncover more potential candidates. I’m glad it works for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small feedback: I would like to be able to enter my own profile to see how I will appear on the site. It would also be nice to know what searches my profile would be most likely to pop up for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting idea, but it didn't work for me. I tried "Zig developer" and it showed results that hadn't done much Zig work recently.Developers known for their zig work like mitchellh, matklad, and Jarred-Sumner weren't in the results at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43621350</guid></item><item><title>48.

An invasive procedure that oxygenates and pumps blood.  It's boosted survival rate for those who are not responding to CPR (15-20 minutes duration) from 3% to 28%.  The general CPR survival rate is an exponential looking curve: starting around 20%, reducing to 10% at 10 minutes and 3% at 20 minutes [3].[1] https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-07/nsw-ambulance-ecmo-tr...[2] https://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/mobile-cardiac-treatme...[3] https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076019Edit: The numbers in [3] are optimistic, as they are for in-hospital CPR, not out-of-hospital CPR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if this is true, but my cardiologist said that everyone who trains hard for a marathon has some level of heart damage from the excessive training. This sounds extreme to me, but I was in to see him for some AFIB episodes that were triggered from pushing myself too hard. It's worth noting that endurance athletes are 2 to 10 times more likely to develop AFIB compared to non-athletes. So this is a bit of warning to apply some level of moderation to your training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I - like ~20% of the humans of planet earth - have a bridged LAD coronary artery. The vast majority of those who have this congenital deformity will never know it and remain asymptomatic; a small cohort of those will, like me, have a minor heart attack and fully recover - a smaller cohort will die of sudden cardiac arrest, many of them males in their teens while practicing football or performing similar cardiac stressing events. Unfortunately determining this congenital deformity requires invasive radiological imaging - hopefully this technology will assist in it's identification sooner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596133</guid></item><item><title>50.

Mainly that they did not require a diagnosis for ADHD but instead separated participants based on a questionnaire regarding symptoms. Additionally their participant pool somehow contained more than 20% of neurodevelopmental disorders and other mental health disorders which seems very high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in school, many decades ago, I was constantly told that I should turn off the music while studying.  I always ignored that advice, and to this day while I'm working (I'm a software engineer) I almost always have music playing.  I'll pick instrumental music if I'm having trouble focusing; but I usually prefer upbeat music with lyrics.I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, etc.; when I was young, being "autistic" meant being almost or nearly non-functional.  But I've had my suspicions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618140</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common perception that PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities are slow and outlines how, when configured properly, they can actually provide fast and efficient search results. It explains various techniques and optimizations, such as using appropriate indexing methods, leveraging ts_vectors and ts_queries, and tuning configuration parameters to enhance performance. The author aims to debunk myths about the inefficiency of PostgreSQL's full-text search and provides insights into best practices for achieving faster search operations in applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm one of the pg_search maintainers. Hello! A few thoughts.First, both strategies - the one outlined by the Neon/ParadeDB article, and the one used here -- are presented as viable alternatives by the Postgres docs: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-tables.ht....Second - as the article correctly demonstrates, the problem with Postgres FTS isn't "how can I pick and optimize a single pre-defined query" it's "how do I bring Postgres to Elastic-level performance across a wide range of real-world boolean, fuzzy, faceted, relevance-ranked, etc. queries?"`pg_search` is designed to solve the latter problem, and the benchmarks were made to reflect that. You can always cherry-pick a query and optimize it at the expense of data duplication and complexity. The Neon/ParadeDB benchmarks contained 12 queries in total, and the benchmarks could have:- Created composite b-tree indexes for each of the queries with boolean predicates- Extracted the all the text fields from JSONBs, stored and indexed them as a separate columns for queries against JSONBBut that's not realistic for many real-world use cases. `pg_search` doesn't require that - it's a simple index definition that works for a variety of "Elastic style" queries and Postgres types and doesn't ask the user to duplicate every text column.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Mistake #1: Calculating tsvector On-the-Fly (Major issue)I'm shocked that the original post being referred to made this mistake. I recently implemented Postgres FTS in a personal project, and did so by just reading the Postgres documentation on FTS following the instructions. The docs lead you through the process of creating the base unoptimized case, and then optimising it, explaining the purpose of each step and why it's faster. It's really clear that is what it's doing, and I could only assume that someone making this mistake is either doing so to intentionally misrepresent Postgres FTS, or because they haven't read the basic documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there were some explain plans in either post, since I don't get what's going on.If the query uses the index, then the on the fly tsvector rechecks are only on the matches and the benchmark queries have LIMIT 10, so few rechecks right?Edit: yes but the query predicates have conditions on 2 gin indexes, so I guess the planner chooses to recheck all the matches for one index first even though it could avoid lots of work by rechecking row-wise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43627646</guid></item><item><title>2.

When I was working in engineering in the early aughts, we mocked the Chinese as being able only to copy American technology. Today, China is competitive with or ahead of America in key technology areas, including nuclear power, AI, EVs, and batteries.We need to anticipate a future where China is equal to America on a per capita basis, but four times bigger. Is that a world where “Designed by Apple in California, Made in China” still makes sense? What will be America’s competitive edge in that scenario?What seems most likely to me in the future is that the US will find itself in the same position the UK is in now. Dominating finance and services won’t mean anything when both the IP and the physical products are being produced somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But if we bump the cost of freight, insurance, and customs from $5 to, say, $28, then they wholesale the shoes to Footlocker for about $75. And if Footlocker purchases Nike shoes for $75, then they retail them for $150. Everyone needs to fixed percentages to avoid losses.I don't understand this paragraph.  If Footlocker was okay with $50 profit/shoe, why do they need to claim $75 profit/shoe in their costs per shoe go up?  The costs of handling the shoes, retail space, advertising, and labor are all fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631543</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not guessing is perhaps the most important thing to the business.I developed a lot of my problem solving skills in semiconductor manufacturing  where the cost of a bad assumption tends to be astronomical. You need to be able to determine exactly what the root cause is 100% of the time or everything goes to hell really fast. If there isn't a way to figure out the root cause, you now have 2 tickets to resolve.I'll throw an entire contraption away the moment I determine it has accumulated some opacity that antagonizes root cause analysis. This is why I aggressively avoid use of non-vanilla technology stacks. You can certainly chase the rabbit over the fence into the 3rd party's GitHub repo, but I find the experience gets quite psychedelic as you transition between wildly varying project styles, motivations and scopes.Being deeply correct nearly all of the time is probably the fastest way to build a reputation. The curve can be exponential over time with the range being the value of the problem you are entrusted with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Read the Reference&gt; Don’t GuessI find that, when working with a new "thing," I often like to guess for about an hour or so before I really do a deep dive into the reference. Or, I'll read a stackoverflow answer or two, play around with it, and then go to reference.Why?Often there's a lot of context in the reference that only makes sense once I've had some hands-on time with whatever the reference is describing.This is especially the case when learning a new language or API: I'll go through a tutorial / quickstart; "guess" at making a change; and then go back and read the reference with a better understanding of the context.BTW: This is why I like languages and IDEs that support things like intellisense. It's great to be able to see little bits of documentation show up in my IDE to help me in my "guess" stage of learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Don’t go to Stack Overflow, don’t ask the LLM, don’t guess, just go straight to the source. Oftentimes, it’s surprisingly accessible and well-written."It's a bit like math books. I dreaded reading formal math during my engineering -- always read accessible text. Got a little better in my master's and could read demse chapters which got to the point quickly. At least now I can appreciate why people write terse references, even Tutte books.Some references are a pleasure to use. For rust crates, I always go to docs.rs and search there. It's just fantastic. i can search for a function that returns a particular type or accept a particular type etc. hoogle from Haskell was lovely too when I took a functional programming course in college. Cpp reference is also pretty good -- thanks for adding examples.Today I was reading boto3 python library docs, and I immediately missed docs.rs!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43629307</guid></item><item><title>5.

All I want is a simple example conversation that includes the actual LLM outputs used to trigger a call and the JSON that goes over the wire… maybe I’ll take some time and make a cheat-sheet.I have to say, the endorsements at the end somehow made this seem worse…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some very quick initial thoughts - the json spec has some similarities to mcp: https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=agent-card - there's an agent card that describes capabilities that google wants websites to host at https://DOMAIN/.well-known/agent.json according to https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/agent_discovery so crawlers can scrape to discover agents.The jsonrpc calls look similar-ish to mcp tool calls except the inputs and outputs look closer to the inputs/outputs from calling an LLM (ie messages, artifacts, etc.).The JS server example that they give is interesting https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/js/src/serve... - they're using a generator to send sse events back to the caller - a little weird to expose as the API instead of just doing what express allows you to do after setting up an sse connection (res.send / flush multiple times).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631381</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a somewhat contrarian opinion. I think if you're making a clone of Tetris you should actually take design cues from the somewhat more obscure Tetris the Grand Master series instead of the "guideline" or NES Tetris rules. TGM's rotation and kick rules are a lot more elegant and avoid a lot of unneeded complexity. Guideline Tetris kicks let you do absurd and weird things (look up the series of kicks that make up a T-Spin Triple and see if that makes sense to you) and rewards doing canned setups really fast, whereas TGM's game design is all about doing good stacking very fast.The TGM randomization algorithm is also pretty elegant. 7 bag is a bit extreme, it gives you such a perfect set of pieces at all times that it's genuinely less challenging and fun. TGM's random piece algorithm is a lot simpler: the randomizer has a 4-piece history window and it tries multiple times (IIRC, 6) to find a unique piece that hasn't appeared in that window. It is initialized to SSZZ to lower the odds of starting with an S or Z early on. (~~They also use the Mersenne Twister as their PRNG, which was a pretty good PRNG in an era where many games still used LCGs.~~ edit: Apparently, they do not. Don't ask me where I got this, I have no idea.)Now of course I'm not sure if it matters at all for this particular game since it isn't really a Tetris clone at all, but while TGM is a well-known cult classic for people deep into Tetris it's relatively obscure outside of that circle (and presumably outside of Japan.) The Tetris Company is very strange about licensing and has apparently, as the legend has it, blocked and forced changes on TGM releases for a very long time due to the fact that it doesn't fit with the Tetris guideline rules they enforce in an oddly totalitarian fashion, probably suppressing the game even further in an era where speed games and competitive gaming is a lot more popular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rabbit hole runs much deeper, this is a specification of the rotation system for current (modern) Tetris games:https://harddrop.com/wiki/SRSThe "modern" rules ("guideline", as the community calls them), with Hold, 7-bag, multiple previews and a rotation system that allows easy T-spins make for more interesting multiplayer games that go beyond "who can spam Tetrises the fastest".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the implied general principle of the wall kick - if the user tries to do an action in a state that doesn't allow it, if there's something that's useful and pretty close, do that instead.For instance, I'm building a tree editor with vim movement keys, and I found that a "j" that brings me up to the first child or next sibling node is strictly more useful than a "j" that only descends to children and a "l" that only goes to the next sibling.Obviously, you have to be very careful to avoid introducing footguns, but the idea of "don't dogmatically adhere to operation semantics" is good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631656</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the chroot technique, a Unix-based method that enables the execution of a program in a modified root directory, isolating it from the rest of the file system. This technique is commonly used to enhance security by restricting a program's access to the system while allowing it to run in a controlled environment. The piece outlines the benefits of chroot, such as improved security and system integrity, as well as potential pitfalls, including the complexity of managing dependencies and limitations in user permissions. Overall, the article provides insights into how chroot can be effectively implemented for various applications in system administration and software deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories - I owned a large web hosting company and we had thousands of machines. When hardware issues came up, or machines wouldn't boot, using this method was our first line of defense - we'd boot the machine from a burned copy of "Recovery Is Possible" which was an all-in-one Linux distro for recovery, then mount the partitions and chroot in to figure out what is going on - or use rsync to migrate data off as needed.Just looked and it looks like "Recovery Is Possible" hasn't been updated in a dozen years which dates my story, but I fondly remember overnight phone calls from panicked new sysadmins and telling them to be calm and "RIP it and get chrooted in" and then waking up to help them troubleshoot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With qemu-user and binfmt you can even chroot into foreign CPU architectures, which is a handy thing to have when you mount your phone's eMMC to fix a hacking session gone wrong.Though these days you may want to look into things like systemd-nspawn instead of plain chroot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually wish that instead of docker &amp; etc we had just gotten a better chroot... Or maybe just a new kernel syscall that is chroot()++.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632379</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of Content Security Policies (CSP) to enhance the security of the Firefox frontend. It outlines the importance of CSP in mitigating risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded and executed within the browser. The author provides insights into the specific CSP rules applied to Firefox, the challenges faced during implementation, and the overall impact on improving the browser's security posture. The goal is to share best practices and encourage developers to adopt similar strategies in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox really needs to fix their CSP for extensions before this kind of thing.Here is the 9 year old bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267027And their extension store does not permit workarounds, even though they themselves have confirmed it's a bug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSP is really great at plugging these kinds of security holes, but it flummoxes me that most developers and designers don't take them seriously enough to implement properly (styles must only be set though &lt;link&gt;, and JS likewise exists only in external files). Doing any styling or scripting inline should be frowned upon as hard as table-based layouts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an entire class of vulnerabilities that would've never been possible with XUL, is that correct?I appreciate they had to move for other reasons but I also really don't like the idea that the DevTools and browser chrome itself now has all of the same security issues/considerations as anything else "web" does. It was bad with Electron (XSS suddenly becoming an RCE) and makes me pretty nervous here too :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43630388</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;SpaceTimeDB provides a platform for managing and querying spatiotemporal data, facilitating the analysis and visualization of data that varies across both space and time. It offers features such as a powerful SQL-like query language, built-in support for various geographic data types, and tools for integrating with popular programming languages. The platform aims to enhance decision-making in applications ranging from geospatial analysis to environmental monitoring, making it easier for users to work with complex datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SpacetimeDB fits into a genre of tech that I want to call "universe brain reorgs" - structural re-arrangements that might unlock wild performance increases. The challenge with these is that they require devs to re-align their thinking and it's hard to disentangle if "the problem" is that the technology isn't being fully embraced or if the promises of the tech don't work for your use case.Other techs in this category have seen a lot of success. I'd classify Elixir and Node as being similar in that you adopt a stack to get access to some rare guarantees and also accept new or exotic limits.I think these things tend to rely on having clear-eyed visionaries out in front, able to show off their strengths in open source. Without a successful project it's hard to believe the claims. I hope clockwork labs is able to deliver their example game (it seems high risk because, even if the game is a technical wonder - what if it isn't fun?!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best comment from last time this got posted:I kept on reading expecting to see motion prediction, multiversion, or similar given the name and focus on games, but no. This is a totally normal database, designed for low latency and with support for WASM stored procedures. You can host your own server or they will rent you one.
Don't get me wrong, this looks very nice. It looks like a solid building block for persistent worlds in multiplayer games. You'll just have to do your lag masking netcode yourself.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593913&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; SpacetimeDB wasn't built in a vacuum. It's the system powers our own large-scale MMORPG BitCraft. We designed it specifically for the performance requirements of games. That means extremely low latency (~100 us/Tx) and extremely high throughput (~1,000,000 Tx/s).If you are trying to build a new MMO that scales to the moon, you might want to take a look at how the existing market goes about things.Take World of Warcraft for example. You could probably put a $20 MySQL VPS behind a realm and have it reliably persist state with how authoritative and infrequently updated the clients are.Being clever with what you can trust the client with and how the server reconciles events is where I think you will find most of the scaling hacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631822</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It’s the T-bills wot dun it."That’s my read on why the U.S. just paused the global tariff hike to 10%.From the beginning, I’ve believed the executive branch's real goal was to push down the yield on the 10-year Treasury. Why? Because Uncle Sam has to refinance a mountain of debt this year, and the cost of that depends heavily on Treasury yields — especially the 10-year. That’s the rate that sets the tone for everything from mortgages to corporate borrowing.So they tried to spook markets. Introduce global tariffs. Stir up uncertainty. And it worked—at first. Yields dipped. Traders moved to Treasuries as a typical flight-to-safety.But then something flipped.Instead of being seen as a safe haven, U.S. debt itself started to look shaky. Maybe it was the deficit outlook, maybe the global response to tariffs — but whatever it was, yields started climbing. Fast.At that point, the strategy backfired. The executive branch had no choice but to walk it back. So they paused the tariffs.Because when your national budget depends on cheap debt, you can't afford a crisis of confidence in your bonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 10% apparently also apply to Canada and Mexico now, which they didn’t before:&gt; In a strange turn of events, the president seems to have added another 10 percent tariff to Canada and Mexico. Asked earlier if the 10 percent tariff extended to those countries, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said that it did. And a White House official clarified for me just now that that was the case. Previously, Canada and Mexico had been exempted from this round of “reciprocal” tariffs, though they still faced a 25 percent tariff that the president imposed last month on many of their goods.https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/08/business/trump-tarif...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibly because lawsuits challenging the power of the President to impose tariffs under the Emergency Economic Powers Act are underway.[1] GOP support for Congress taking back control of tariffs is building.[2] At some point, Congress or the courts will take his toys away.[1] https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariffs-hit-lawsuit-group-his...[2] https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5236142-congress-tariff-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43634806</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A common question is: “how much are students using AI to cheat?” That’s hard to answer, especially as we don’t know the specific educational context where each of Claude’s responses is being used.I built a popular product that helps teachers with this problem.Yes, it's "hard to answer", but let's be honest... it's a very very widespread problem. I've talked to hundreds of teachers about this and it's a ubiquitous issue. For many students, it's literally "let me paste the assignment into ChatGPT and see what it spits out, change a few words and submit that".I think the issue is that it's so tempting to lean on AI. I remember long nights struggling to implement complex data structures in CS classes. I'd work on something for an hour before I'd have an epiphany and figure out what was wrong. But that struggling was ultimately necessary to really learn the concepts. With AI, I can simply copy/paste my code and say "hey, what's wrong with this code?" and it'll often spot it (nevermind the fact that I can just ask ChatGPT "create a b-tree in C" and it'll do it). That's amazing in a sense, but also hurts the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Students primarily use AI systems for creating (using information to learn something new)this is a smooth way to not say "cheat" in the first paragraph and to reframe creativity in a way that reflects positively on llm use. in fairness they then say&gt; This raises questions about ensuring students don’t offload critical cognitive tasks to AI systems.and later they report&gt; nearly half (~47%) of student-AI conversations were Direct—that is, seeking answers or content with minimal engagement. Whereas many of these serve legitimate learning purposes (like asking conceptual questions or generating study guides), we did find concerning Direct conversation examples including: - Provide answers to machine learning multiple-choice questions
- Provide direct answers to English language test questions
- Rewrite marketing and business texts to avoid plagiarism detectionkudos for addressing this head on. the problem here, and the reason these are not likely to be democratizing but rather wedge technologies, is not that they make grading harder or violate principles of higher education but that they can disable people who might otherwise learn something&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like Anthropic has an incentive to minimize how much students use LLMs to write their papers for them.In the article, I guess this would be buried in&gt;  Students also frequently used Claude to provide technical explanations or solutions for academic assignments (33.5%)—working with AI to debug and fix errors in coding assignments, implement programming algorithms and data structures, and explain or solve mathematical problems."Write my essay" would be considered a "solution for academic assignment," but by only referring to it obliquely in that paragraph they don't really tell us the prevalence of it.(I also wonder if students are smart, and may keep outright usage of LLMs to complete assignments on a separate, non-university account, not trusting that Anthropic will keep their conversations private from the university if asked.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633383</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just for the context, I've been making (and selling) database (migration/translation) tools for 20-ish years.What you have built can definitely become a product supporting you with a very nice income. Free version can stay free but you can sell solo licenses and team licenses as subscriptions. Paid license users will also have your support - and that matters to companies.As others have said, commercial features can be built on top of the OSS product, like Electron desktop client, support for more databases, for views/procedures etc.There is no downside to trying to commercialize this. Whoever wants to use what you have built so far can continue and I guarantee that many companies would be happy to give you $50/month for a more advanced version with support.(edit for typo)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a really cool project.Some observations...First I'd get some legal advice for how to convert this idea / product into a thing that you own and have a stake in, but that's distinct from you.  This means you'd be able to collect money and attribute that money to the product, you'd be able to sell it to someone else and walk away from it, etc.  This legal construct is important; probably not _necessary_ but very useful.You seem to have a reasonable community contributing to and using the project; that's your most valuable asset.  Make up a brief roadmap of where you'd like to take the project in six and eighteen months, share that with the community.  Think about how some projects, like Elastic.co, grew based on community feedback and how ultimately perhaps those companies felt they needed to change the company in ways that many in the original community disagreed with.  There are lots of sides to that coin, and you as the founder need to think about how you'd want to develop the product.Lastly, once you've got a clear accounting mechanism of how to track money from it and costs of it, you should just .... start asking people for money.  "How much is a support contract worth for this?"  "How much is it worth to you to focus on developing this feature instead of that?"  Obviously -- be very cautious if people are offering money in exchange for fractional ownership of "the thing" but even that may be palatable... but make sure you've had someone representing your interests read the contract...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It can even export as Mermaid? That's awesome. I could see that being super useful as a way to take a db schema and turn it into a chart for a github readme. Definitely bookmarking this.Btw, the SQL import doesn't seem to work for an sqlite `.schema` dump; it breaks on the PRIMARY KEY here:    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "__EFMigrationsHistory" (
        "MigrationId" TEXT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT "PK___EFMigrationsHistory" PRIMARY KEY,
        "ProductVersion" TEXT NOT NULL
    );

(This is the standard migrations table that Entity Framework creates.)W/r/t monetization, you should know there's a really powerful flowchart tool called draw.io that's already free. It's not tailored specifically towards databases the way yours is, but it can make similar graphs, so if you go too hard on monetizing you might cause people to just use that instead. Maybe there are some more B2B-oriented extensions or db integrations, or maybe a team collaboration feature you could add without compromising the core tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43627758</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "austen" provides a collection of tools and resources for analyzing the works of Jane Austen. It includes scripts for text processing, visualizations, and various analyses related to her novels. The project aims to facilitate literary studies by making it easier to explore themes, character interactions, and stylistic elements in Austen's writings, catering to both scholars and enthusiasts of literature. Additionally, the repository offers clear instructions for usage and encourages collaboration and contributions from other users interested in literary analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool idea, but from my tests it seems like the LLM needs more grounding since it misses lots of characters.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I didn't realize pipewire had builtin support for this! I've been using a different piece of software called Easy Effects[1] on my framework laptop.To equalize my laptop, I ended up buying a umik-1, and using REW to calculate all the filter coefficients (you can import REW's filter export right into Easy Effects). It's a subtle difference at first, but it's much cleaner (I also usually have a compressor and loudness effect enabled, as the framework speakers are pretty quiet).[1] https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, when attempting to apply this to speakers, the anechoic frequency response is required. If you try to equalize for flat-in-room response, the results are terrible. See this video[1] for loads more information and context.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpUDuUtxPM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ho wow, the sample video shows incredible results, I'd love to read more about how to configure it with my own laptop and microphone. Settings ought to be different for each laptop model, right ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43635295</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "linux-kernel-defence-map" provides a comprehensive overview of security features and defense mechanisms implemented within the Linux kernel. It serves as a resource for developers and security researchers, categorizing various defensive strategies, vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques to enhance Linux kernel security. The project includes detailed documentation, examples, and references to assist users in understanding and improving kernel defense, making it a valuable tool for those interested in kernel development and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is by the author of the very helpful kernel-hardening-checker: https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hardening-checkerAn interesting tool for analyzing your personal kernel config file and pointing out areas for security improvement. It's more comprehensive than KSPP (https://kspp.github.io/) but sometimes goes a little too far, suggesting disabling kernel features you may actively use.Definitely worth trying!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of defenses is pretty impressive. The number of out-of-tree and commercial defenses is also impressive. The amount dedicated to specifics of C (UB, bounds checks, use-after-free) is relatively small.It would be interesting to compare to, say, OpenBSD, with its apparently numerous security and defense-in-depth features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it inspiring that we are getting to where we are dealing with models that classify vulnerabilities at a systems level. However I also think we are kind of barking up the wrong three. There is IMHO something wrong with the current strategy of scaling up the von Neumann architecture. It leads to fragile software partitioning, noisy neighbors and both slow and sometimes unintended communication through shared memory. I’ve tried to lay this out in detail here https://lnkd.in/dRNSYPWC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597264</guid></item><item><title>16.

The use of Common Lisp instead of C, Vala, or even C++ makes the problem even easier to tackle. No wonder Barium ended up being so compact, while doing everything a simple but complete toolkit needs to do.It may even age gracefully, as the author wants it to, provided that Xlib stays around. Or maybe it could eventually develop a thin abstraction layer to allow pluggable rectangle-drawing and text-rendering APIs, and start supporting Wayland, too.And emphatically yes, I want scrollbars back where scrollbars are due. Aping Apple in this regard was a very unfortunate choice by GTK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Confine yourself into the prison of someone else’s walled garden at no additional cost.Objection, your honor: At great additional cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;every rant like this inevitably goes into Gnome/GTK world. I must insist how much "better" (for these kinds of people) the Qt/KDE world is! People who are so passionate about this stuff just don't give any credit to one side of the equation that has stuck to its guns in terms of making apps that still have a billion buttons with text labels on them.Seriously, if you find yourself annoyed at Gnome, you can set up KDE and (mostly) have no issues.I say all this...

One area I see being a massive problem is separating 'brands' and 'products', especially with companies that do a really poor job of delineating between their different brands over time.For example 'Quickbooks', 'Quickbooks Online', 'Intuit Quickbooks' all show up occasionally when you ask about 'Accounting software'.As an aside 'Accounting Software', I'm not seeing QBO in the top 3, and Freshbooks in number one. I have never had that result whenever I've run reports.https://productrank.ai/topic/accounting-software
https://www.aibrandrank.com/reports/89&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this idea and think it’s really creative! But for feedback I’d like to see more clarity on what you mean by “rankings”.For example, I searched “Ways to die” and got
1. Drowning
2. Firearms
3. Death during sleepWhat exactly is the ranking criteria here?

I’m intentionally not writing this with Aqua but by hand and it is taking so much longer. This to me feels like what Apple Intelligence could be, it is so much better than stuff all of the big tech is doing. For example, if you tell Siri voice dictation to go back and delete something what Siri will do is just write out “go back and delete something“ also if you tell Siri to go back and spell a name differently all Siri will do is write out the letters that you said to go back and type out. Honestly, for voice dictation software it feels like travelling to another planet in terms of improvement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like it'll slurp up all your data and upload it into a cloud. Thanks, no. I want privacy, offline mode and source code for something as crucial to system security as an input method."we also collect and process your voice inputs [..] We leverage this data for improvements and development [..] Sharing of your information [..] service providers [..] OpenAI"

Recently I had a papilloma removed from my soft palate near my uvula. They checked it for cancer but not HPV, even though they said it was almost certainly HPV.So for $129 I took the OraRisk HPV test which tests for 51 strains, including the ones associated with cancer, and the results came up negative.So I maybe sort of probably don't have HPV, or may have but don't anymore. Or maybe something like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The antiviral valacyclovir was discussed in an article in The Economist recently. Is used to treat herpes simplex or herpes zoster (shingles). What the Economist article discussed is that the drug seems to reduce the severity and onset of dementia. The drug's patent expired long ago.I'll be seeing my doc soon and will be requesting to begin treatment.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valaciclovirhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045215/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised there aren't any commercialized products considering its efficacy and simple origin.I also wonder if there is any way it could be modified to protect more of the body besides just saliva.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636302</guid></item><item><title>21.

I have a workflow and it has already running instances. 2 scenarios:Can I update the workflow while it has running instances without interfering the running instances?Can I update a running instance with a new version of the workflow to patch some flaw?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants this in a humorous 1 hour format, watch the legendary Jim Weirich (rip) explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FITJMJjASUsDon't be discouraged that it is in Ruby as the concepts are completely general. Great watch even though I never coded a line of Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a technique to remember this? I will understand it today and forget after a few weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From scratch it's also easy dress up a quoted Y combinator as in Löb's theorem. Start with the usual Y combinator  Y = \f. (\x.f(x x)) (\x.f(x x))
    : (p -&gt; p) -&gt; p

which can produce a thing of type p from a function f : p -&gt; p.Now Löb's theorem states that []([]p -&gt; p) -&gt; []p, which can be read, "if you have the source code to transform (the source code of a thing of type p) to a thing of type p, then you can produce the source code for a thing of type p". Let's embellish Y using {} to denote the quoting comonad.  Y' = \{f}. (\{x}.{f{x{x}}}) {\{x}.{f{x{x}}}}
     : []([]p -&gt; p) -&gt; []p

To get there, just add quotes as needed: f must be quoted, f's result must be quoted, and f takes a quoted input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636230</guid></item><item><title>23.

The piece also touches on the challenges faced in developing such technology and anticipates the transformative impact it will have on industries like healthcare, finance, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to ignore the mixed record of video generation models:  For visual reasoning practice, we can do supervised fine-tuning on sequences similar to the marble example above. For instance, to understand more about the physical world, we can show the model sequential pictures of Slinkys going down stairs, or basketball players shooting 3-pointers, or people hammering birdhouses together.... 

  But where will we get all this training data? For spatial and physical reasoning tasks, we can leverage computer graphics to generate synthetic data. This approach is particularly valuable because simulations provide a controlled environment where we can create scenarios with known outcomes, making it easy to verify the model's predictions. But we'll also need real-world examples. Fortunately, there's an abundance of video content online that we can tap into. While initial datasets might require human annotation, soon models themselves will be able to process videos and their transcripts to extract training examples automatically. 

Almost every video generator makes constant "folk physics" errors and doesn't understand object permanence. DeepMind's Veo2 is very impressive but still struggles with object permanence and qualitatively nonsensical physics: https://x.com/Norod78/status/1894438169061269750Humans do not learn these things by pure observation (newborns understand object permanence, I suspect this is the case for all vertebrates).  I doubt transformers are capable of learning it as robustly, even if trained on all of YouTube. There will always be "out of distribution" physical nonsense involving mistakes humans (or lizards) would never make, even if they've never seen the specific objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example of the cat and detective hat shows that even with the latest update, it isn't "editing" the image. The generated cat is younger, with bigger, brighter eyes, more "perfect" ears.I found that when editing images of myself, the result looked weird, like a funky version of me. For the cat, it looks "more attractive" I guess, but for humans (and I'd imagine for a cat looking at the edited cat with a keen eye for cat faces), the features often don't work together when changed slightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's sad that they used 4o's image generation feature for the cat example which does some diffusion or something else, results in the whole image changing. They should've instead used Gemini 2.0 Flash's image generation feature (or at least mentioned it!), which, even if far lower quality and resolution (max of 1024x1024, but Gemini will try to match the res of the original image, so you can get something like 681x1024), is much much better at leaving the untouched parts of the image actually "untouched".Here's the best out of a few attempts for a really similar prompt, more detailed since Flash is a much smaller model "Give the cat a detective hat and a monocle over his right eye, properly integrate them into the photo.". You can see how the rest of the image is practically untouched to the naked human eye: https://ibb.co/zVgDbqV3Honestly Google has been really good at catching up in the LLM race, and their modern models like 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro are one of (or the) best in their respective areas. I hope that they'll scale up their image generation feature to base it on 2.5 Pro (or maybe 3 Pro by the time they do it) for higher quality and prompt adherence.If you want, you can give 2.0 Flash image gen a try for free (with generous limits) on https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat, just select it in the model selector on the right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633568</guid></item><item><title>24.

This innovative project, aimed at demonstrating sustainable agriculture practices, features detailed insights into the reactor's design and functionality. The creator shares their experience, technical challenges, and the potential implications of harnessing this process for efficient fertilizer production and reduced environmental impact in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses efforts to improve graph accessibility for blind and low-vision readers through innovative technologies. Researchers at MIT have developed a tactile graph system that allows users to feel the shapes and patterns represented in data visualizations. This system integrates 3D printing and haptic feedback, enabling users to engage with graphs in a meaningful way. The initiative aims to bridge the information gap for visually impaired individuals, ensuring they can access and understand data just as effectively as their sighted peers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One time when I was very young, I was given some paper to draw on. It looked and felt like normal paper, but when you drew on it with a marker, it would swell up under the marker line creating a raised area. Putting a piece in water revealed that it was some sort of ultra compressed sponge, like a thin version of those compacted kitchen sponges you can get.I realized later that it must have been some sort of "paper for the blind" so that you could draw on it or maybe print on it with an inkjet and be able to feel the surface even if you couldn't see it. Maybe it was just a sponge, but it didn't seem any thicker than normal paper. It's been 20+ years and I've never encountered anything like it since.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's great to see an automated method for this, even if it still needs to be reviewed by an expert. Back on the 2011-2014 era I was on a team which helped make materials available for a chemistry grad student. I wasn't aware of the standards book, but followed more or less the same process outlined in the paper, using GIMP to simplify images, paste into Word, and add textboxes with braille font to the images, and then embossed. It was probably 5-10 minutes of effort for a basic graph, and we were doing the work for entire math and chemistry books. This would have saved so much time for us!We also had to figure out how to represent electron clouds. Some could be done as 2-D representations, but eventually 3-D was required. We created a plugin for Blender which would import a MacMolPlt save file, generate the structure for the molecule (coordinates for each atom, bond types connecting the atoms), and a point cloud for the electron cloud. Each column of the periodic table was a different shape, each row was a different scale. It worked pretty well, and generating STL files was automated.The program is somewhere on my hard drive not available publicly and probably technically owned by Iowa State or the federal government, whether they know it or not. I'm curious how much it'd take to get out running on a current version of Blender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tactonom Reader seems like an interesting multi-modal approach that is readily available: https://www.tactonom.com/en/product/tactonomreader/In general, tactile graphics is a long-standing issue.  In the past, the most basic simple mechanical solution wasn't that bad.  Just needs a special kind of paper and a ballpoint pen.  My teachers used to hand-draw curves for me on demand, however, that was at high-school level...The more complex the solution gets, the more work/knowhow is required to prepare a particular graphic.  Turnaround time gets longer, and the expertise expected from the educator gets more complex.  Its questionable how many casual educators end up being able/willing to prepare graphics for/on a complex digital system...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595193</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of hand-nixing, a traditional method of combining ingredients for baking, particularly in bread-making. It emphasizes the benefits of this technique, including improved texture and flavor development, and provides a step-by-step guide on how to effectively mix dough by hand. The author also highlights the tactile experience of baking, encouraging bakers to engage with their ingredients and produce artisanal loaves at home.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been using Nix personally and professionally for almost 10 years now (yikes has time passed quickly!) and I have never needed to operate at the level of derivations like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, don't you just like it when projects that use hashsums, calculate them in such a way that you can't actually recalculate them on your own? And when you start digging, you find not only that it uses the same basic design of XML-DSig while barely escaping its fatal flaws, it also uses some bizarre data encodings nobody else uses for anything. And then the resulting hash is not even the truncation of the actual hash, it has an additional (again, entirely undocumented) strange post-processing step for unspecified reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I walk away from every article on or attempt to use Nix more mystified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43607325</guid></item><item><title>28.

Then delete anything you’re worried about being misinterpreted or saved by the government. That can include conversations that compromise the privacy of the people on the other end. You might delete messages about politics, contact information for political dissidents, apps that save offline copies of sensitive documents like Google Docs, even your phone’s built-in Notes app.Mind you, this is for entering the country that considers itself the freest in the world...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Locking down" is almost always a bad approach when it comes to border crossings. You have very little rights at the border, so keeping your phone locked and refusing to divulge the 20 characters password isn't really an option. Even without the threat of detaining you, they can refuse entry (if you're not a citizen/permanent resident), or seize your $1000 phone/laptop. Far better to wipe your phone and restore from backup after you've crossed the border. The article does make a good point that you should seed your wiped phone with signs of activity so it doesn't look freshly wiped.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43630624</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on the Pilot Project Basic Income in Germany, where researchers and policymakers are exploring the impact of unconditional basic income on individuals and society. It outlines the project's objectives, including assessing the social, economic, and personal effects of providing financial security to participants over a three-year period. The site provides details about the project's methodology, participant criteria, and how the findings may contribute to the broader conversation on basic income as a potential social safety net. Additionally, it offers insights into the ongoing discussions and considerations surrounding basic income implementation in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of thing pops up now and again but the psychology is completely different to if basic income was actually universal and expected to continue in the long-term.Of course people don't quit their jobs and careers because they are part of a small group enrolled in a 3-year scientific study. Human behaviour is non-linear.The study doesn't cover the likely feedback effects on the broader economy that a universal rollout would have (increase in the money supply) or the broader socio-cultural changes that would likely accompany it.In short: scale matters for this kind of thing. Some things just can't be tested ahead of time empirically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cost of an annuity that pays your basic, fundamental living expenses: Food, shelter, water, etc. can be thought of as a debt that all
people are born with. In the US, you can obtain a room in an apartment, basic food, internet access, and transportation (minimal versions of all of these), for something like $15,000/year.such a lifetime annuity would cost the average 18 year old on the order of 200-300 thousand dollars. This means that an 18 year old starts with about the same level of implicit debt, that a doctor who has just finished medical school has explicit debt, except that student debt doesn't scale with inflation.A key feature of a society which values social mobility is reducing the debt burden of its children. I don't think the answer on basic income is cut and dry, and I do think its important for people to sustain themselves via their own efforts, but since you likely wouldn't increase the debt burden of a teenager, and  you also didn't select the debt burden of the average teenager. You should at least consider the possibility that you would actually choose to reduce, by some amount, the debt burden of the average teenager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry if this offends, but I am deeply skeptical that the effect of UBI is independent of common culturally influenced behaviors of where it might be implemented. Try it in an opioid epidemic stricken rust belt town in the American Midwest, or an urban ghetto (I'm not totally sold that the selection criteria for the Stockton study were unbiased) and let us know how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636757</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI generated recruits are a fiction. That's not to say there aren't fake or bait and switch recruits but this idea makes no sense.Some background. I'm a senior developer who has performed hundreds of interviews and seen dozens of questionable recruits long before AI. Typically the scam is that an offshore consultancy wants to place some roles to collect wages. Many of these agencies are from collectivist cultures, so in the mind of the agency, they all work in our project. This may not be true, but the agency sees the position as theirs, not the recruit's. So they typically don't the issue with putting recruit A in front of the interviewer and then slotting recruit B in after the position is secured. I've seen this done with A talking while B moves their lips on camera. Now with chatGPT (and earlier to some degree with just Google Search) we just see applicants eyes focused on something they're reading when we ask questions. All of this is just as easy as an AI generated applicant (if not easier) and quite likely to get the recruit hired.A lot of this narrative is pointing the finger at China, North Korea and Russia/Ukraine. The best candidates I've fielded have been Ukrainian, Russian and Chinese. These are countries well known for their tech sectors. North Korea has executed the largest crypto heists in history. These are not groups who need to fake it.So who does this narrative serve? It serves the RTO CEOs. This makes CEOs scared to hire remote workers and lets the ones who demand it have a reason.If anything the panic around AI should reinforce the need to think critically about these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When voice authentication startup Pindrop Security posted a recent job opening, one candidate stood out from hundreds of others.&gt; The applicant, a Russian coder named Ivan, seemed to have all the right qualifications for the senior engineering role. When he was interviewed over video last month, however, Pindrop’s recruiter noticed that Ivan’s facial expressions were slightly out of sync with his words.&gt; That’s because the candidate, whom the firm has since dubbed “Ivan X,” was a scammer using deepfake software and other generative AI tools in a bid to get hired by the tech company, said Pindrop CEO and co-founder Vijay Balasubramaniyan.Hm, let's read on.&gt; As for “Ivan X,” Pindrop’s Balasubramaniyan said the startup used a new video authentication program it created to confirm he was a deepfake fraud.Oh, I get it, it's an ad for Pindrop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another remote employment fraud that is much more prevalent is "Overemployment". You will get an applicant that is very skilled and hits the interview out of the park. But then when hired they are working many jobs and just trying to steal as many paychecks as they can until you fire them. They keep their first jobs resume clean and they all check out.There is a Reddit community with over 400k members to show how prevalent this is [1]. There's lots of tactics like not allowing mentions on LinkedIn so they can't be publicly mentioned and seen by other unsuspecting employers, and just maintaining plausible deniability about why they can't make an on camera meeting. It is technically not illegal so it is very lucrative and hard to detect.https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/top/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631384</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised there isn't mention that a big part of the tariff strategy is to throw the equity markets into chaos in an effort to drive down the price of the 10-year bond. There was a panic last night because the 10 year bond price started going up as stocks were trading down, which is not supposed to happen. It would be truly disruptive if the whole game gets blown up by a lack of buyers for US debt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; using trade flows to measure the health of the economic relationship with these countries — any country, really, but particularly final assembly countries — is legitimately stupidA simple way to see this is you have can a system of three countries, A, B, and C, where A only exports to B, B to C, and C to A. All have net neutral trade, but are in a deficit with someone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking about the merits of these tariffs kind of misses the point. The person who wrote this article is very smart. I am sure they are smarter than I am. He has produced a pretty solid analysis of trade policy. But in articles like this people ascribe their own motivations and goals to the tariffs that aren't actually there. Buried in this article is the assumption that the motivation of tariffs and trade policy is to maintain competitiveness with China in manufacturing for both economic and security reasons.This may be important to the author but it isn't a top priority for the administration. Competitiveness with China and onshoring manufacturing are certainly talking points but they is not stated as the primary motivation for the tariffs. The administration characterizes trade imbalances as countries taking advantage of us. The tariffs are targeted based on trade imbalance. If manufacturing was the goal why apply tariffs to things like raw materials? If competition with China is the goal why apply tariffs to South Korea or Japan, pushing them closer into China's orbit? These are just not the goals of the tariffs and neither their rhetoric or actions suggest that they are.People have a hard time dealing with values and motivations that are wildly different from their own so they construct all sorts of parallel explanations and defend those instead. But talking about these explanations is non sequitur. It is like the administration adopted a policy of jailing all Capricorns and only Capricorns and people started writing think pieces about how the criminal justice system would be more efficient if they focused on programs to reduce recidivism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631276</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that has been working really well for me this year is the "internet Shabbat" rule: 24 hours of no TCP/IP every week. Friday night I pull the plug on the modem + turn off data on my phone, then enjoy all of Saturday in a disconnected mode. I can still be on the computer, just no internet.It's amazing how much things I get done... it literally feels like I have two days instead of one. If I put a item like "outdoor exercise for 30 mins" in my TODO list, then I actually do it! Close friends and family can still reach me by phone/text, but all the chat groups and other messaging app distractions are silent.I can still end up zoning out watching a movie in the evening, but it's more intentional: I had to pick the movie in advance and download it so I can view it offline.The contrast with Sunday when I turn the internet back on is very notable. Suddenly the next day is disorganized and end up wasting hours on youtube recommendations, and following rabit holes, and hacker news of course.My conclusion is that it's not the apps or the internet, it's the feeds (when information is being pushed down to you) that are the problem. It's just too convenient and we end up staying in it.Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not like TikTok has a 100% chance of hypnotizing you into a zombie that can only spend its waking hours thinking about dancing people and positive vibes. Only a very high chance, depending on how anxious/bored you are, amplified by the hard work of psychology PhDs.It's so difficult to imagine the mindset of a person who can approach TikTok from a healthy perspective and not need to rely on what used to be called "parental controls" in the past to artificially prevent them from doomscrolling all day. They would just never need to consume advice like this. Surely those people must exist? Who are they?But when you're slapped with something like C-PTSD from an early age, you aren't afforded the ability to address anxiety effectively. You have to turn to something to soothe your anxiety all the time or it will drive you insane.If you were to try to go the complete or semi-aesetic route, you have to consider what lies on the other side of doomscrolling when there's just too much anxiety to function correctly: endless hellfire.I have a hard time believing doomscrolling or needing to restrict screentime at every corner are effective ways to address a completely unrelated inbuilt source of boundless anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"No more doomscrolling.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the actual argument value the JVM receives is "/jars/*", and in turn decides to be helpful, and expand the wildcard anywayWhenever I see such things, I immediately think "whatever the resulting order is, it had better not matter"; and if it does, which is definitely true for Java classpaths, I consider it a bug that needs to be fixed ASAP, before it causes what happened in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counting on the order of files to support multiple versions of jars was never a good idea.  Java does have multiple version ("release") jar files for your use case since java 9. See &lt;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base...&gt;.Since duplicates on the classpath don't cause problems, a quick &amp; dirty fix is to manually list versioned jars first, in order, then the jars/* argument.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; there was a client library that needed a Bouncy Castle “provider” with a version “jdk15”+ as the client initialization used specific properties from a class, and those properties were only available in “jdk15”+.&gt; up until the node image update, we “fortunately” had node images with directory hash seeds ordering “jdk15” or “jdk18” before “jdk14”.So the actual bug is that something needing jdk15+ should either retry or be deterministically fed a valid file, right? And this whole article is figuring out why the filesystem coincidentally masked it by accidentally always happening to hand it a file with what it needed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601026</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the utility of "man" pages, which are manual entries in Unix-based systems that provide documentation for commands and programs. It argues that while "man" pages can be incredibly helpful for users seeking to understand system commands, the challenge often lies with the readers who may struggle to interpret the technical language or navigate the dense formatting. The author encourages a deeper understanding of the content and suggests ways to improve user interaction with "man" pages to make them more accessible, reinforcing the idea that the documentation itself is valuable, but the reading habits and skills of users need to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I disagree. I have been writing man pages for a while, and mastering the language is hard. The documentation for both mdoc and mandb format is not covering the whole language, and the only remaining reference for roff itself seems to be the book by Brian Kernigham. mdoc and mandb are like a macro set on top of roff.Just this week i considered proposing to $distro to convert all manpages to markdown as part of the build process, and then use a markdown renderer on the shipped system to display them. This would allow the distro to stop shipping *roff per default.Markdown profits from the much larger amount of tooling. There are a ton of WYSIWYG editors that would allow non-technical users to write such documentation. I imagine we would all profit if creating manual pages was that easy.On the other side, Markdown is even less formalized. Its like 15 different dialects from different programs that differ in their feature sets and parsing rules. I do not believe things like "How do i quote an asterisk or underscore so it is rendered verbatim" can be portably achieved in Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanding on pjmlp's comment [0] buried in this thread:    export MANPAGER="nvim +Man!"

Using Vim's built in ft-man-plugin [1] as the default man pager seems to go pretty far towards resolving what the author is complaining about.Links work, and it respects the indentation when soft wrapping lines. It isn't doing full reflow or regenerating the page, but it maintains legibility while soft wrapping, and messing up indentation is my main annoyance with less... You can improve less by chopping lines -S by default, but then you have horizontal scrolling so neither is great.[0] In Vim, you can use K to open a man page for the word under the cursor[1] https://neovim.io/doc/user/filetype.html#ft-man-plugin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting used to browsing info pages in Emacs is something that is rather nice.  You can do similar with man pages, there.  Often times, it will let you jump directly to the source code of includes and such, if you want to take a peak at the actual code.To that end, I fully agree with the idea.  The richness of existing man pages is far nicer than many people seem to realize.I do find a bit of dismay at the folks that want to ditch some of that richness and move to markdown or similar.  That lets you layout some things fine, I think.  I am 100% convinced that as you try to get all of the linking and general semantics of the existing solution done, you will find that you have added a lot of "schema" expectations to markdown that isn't there by default.  And then you will start to build "markdown schema" tools to check that what you have fits some standards.  And then...Seriously, just look at a lot of the data that moved to JSON from XML.  I saw they are trying to add namespaces to JSON in some projects.  Truly terrifying to see people slowly and poorly add the features of the more complicated thing they avoided the first time around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631672</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of Rust programming language with ClickHouse, a fast open-source column-oriented database management system. It explores the reasons behind adopting Rust for ClickHouse development, highlighting its performance, safety features, and successful application in building robust systems. Additionally, the article outlines the benefits Rust brings to the ClickHouse ecosystem, such as improved efficiency and reduced errors. It emphasizes the ongoing development and future potential of Rust within the ClickHouse community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that it goes both ways, about plus and minus of both languages, including rewriting back into C++ when it made sense, and the side joke about rewriting existing CLI tools in Rust.While C++ isn't perfect, has the warts of a 50 year's old language, and probably will never match Rust's safety, we would already be in a much better place if at least everyone used the tools at their disposal from the last 30 years.While I would advise to use Rust for some security critical scenarios, there are many others where it is still getting there, and there are other requirements to take into account other than affine types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this. We are a rust shop and we use clickhouse a fair bit. We’ve been quite impressed with its speed and flexibility. I’m glad to see this kind of direct, real-world feedback around both the benefits and difficulties of mixing rust and C++, which we have also had to do a bit of (albeit in the opposite direction: a smattering of C++ in a sea of rust).I’m not sure if the poster here is the post author, but it would be great if the author would consider filling out this survey that was recently released asking for feedback on the future of rust’s vision: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/04/04/vision-doc-survey.htmlI’d love to see rust become the de facto standard for cross-language portable code by virtue of its ease of use, but as this and our experience highlights, there’s some way to go yet!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you do an experiment and say "C++" anywhere on the Internet, in a minute someone will chime in and educate you about the existence of Rust.Many people see this as a problem. The response to TypeScript choosing Go over Rust was pretty gross imho, no one should be abused for choosing a language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596419</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of charity bookshops on the broader landscape of bookselling, questioning whether they drive out independent bookstores and affect local economies. It explores various factors, including pricing, customer behavior, and the role of charity in community engagement. The author presents arguments both for and against the existence of charity bookshops, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of all parties involved in the bookselling ecosystem. The piece ultimately calls for further reflection on the consequences of charity retail for independent booksellers and the literary community at large.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience has been that the second-hand bookshops have had thin times but nonetheless survive because of the internet. They tend to have a better selection compared to charity shops, i.e. not just cast-offs of holiday novels and celeb bios. Shout out to https://www.tillsbookshop.co.uk/ and https://www.armchairbooks.co.uk/There has also been a growth in first-hand bookshops, especially specialists/curators (e.g. only selling sci-fi, only selling books by women, etc.) to distinguish themselves from the Waterstones and Blackwells of this world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But bricks-and-mortar booksellers can sell via the internet too, and booksellers can migrate to lower rent areas. Indeed, there is some evidence of this: there are fewer city centre bookshops and more in smaller, less expensive towns.There was a hip university neighborhood used bookstore here, and even 20+ years ago they were also selling online.Their online inventory included a large amount of stock in a warehouse nearby that wasn't accessible to brick&amp;mortar shoppers.Software automated the online listings and price adjusting.&gt; [...] contemporary book trade and book-collecting directories [...] there were 523 second-hand bookshops in the UK in 1955 [...] and 1,140 in 2014. There are 1,282 now, in April 2025.Anyone know whether these all have a walk-in retail presence, appointment-only (like for rare books), or are a lot of those online-only sellers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anecdotal but I haven't seen a 2nd-hand bookshop in years however those little "tiny libraries" where people just donate their books are in abundance.  What I've seen other used-item shops are doing these days is checking online what things are worth and selling them for very slightly less and it seems like this has to be a death-knell for secondhand stores in general.And I know they have to do this, everything donated has to be checked to ensure safety and cleanliness, it costs them money to keep the shop open and staffed.  But if you can't actually save money by buying secondhand goods there then why would anyone shop there?!  It's a 10 - 20 percent discount on goods that may be years old when Amazon rotates these discounts through new goods 24/7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43637819</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do I have to pick the factors first? Do I have to use all of them? Why shouldn't I use all of them? If I do, why aren't they already picked?Why are all of these sliders? Why don't they start at zero? Why do all of them at the default setting result in me winning?Speaking of, am I winning? Failure and success give me the same feedback. I can play this game over and over until I win? That's not really in the Wordle style.imo you should be picking from a palette of maybe-relevant factors and increasing/decreasing their order of magnitude and order/operation, then when you submit you're locked into a win/loss state like wordle. This would be much more of a game than what you've got here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some feedback:1. Why are factors reorderable? axb = bxa2. Why are factors pickable? Is it coincidence that all of todays choices are useful (or did I mess it up)3. The ranges/sliders ruin it for me IMO, they pick the order of magnitude for you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I echo what the others say about the current interface.I think there is an opportunity for "normal" and "hard mode" like Wordle. In normal you are given the names of the factors but have to enter the expressions for their value (no default values given). In hard you have to come up with your own factor names as well as the values (the name is purely aesthetic for the user to keep track of their ideas). The win condition is the same (be within an order of magnitude of the answer) but maybe there is a special "super" win for being within 10% (log scaled, so lower bound n^0.9 and upper bound n^1.1).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632278</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces the new Rolex Sea-Dweller, highlighting its updated features and design elements. It emphasizes improvements such as an enhanced case size, improved functionality for deep-sea diving, and new aesthetic touches while maintaining the classic Rolex craftsmanship and quality. The piece details the watch’s specifications, its history within the Rolex lineup, and what sets this model apart from its predecessors and other diving watches in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most interesting point of the article is the fact that Rolex are now using MEMS techniques to make silicon mechanical parts for watches.IMO that’s kind of “cheating”, fab tech makes it way too easy compared to traditional metal machining craftsmanship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know folks are going to complain about the aesthetic. As they do literally every time Rolex does something "new".e.g. the Skydweller in the last decade or so.This watch is interesting in that it draws on the Genta-esque integrated bracelet (also reminiscent of their 70s-era quartz stuff). I personally like the hexagons. I think everyone "will have always loved this" in 5-10 years.The technical details of the watch are really on brand for Rolex: they just kinda turned everything up to 11, i.e. new escapement, turning up the BPS, thinner. Overall, I think it's really a great watch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta: wish more watches had a day (of the week) display/complication.Date (of the month) is fine, but Tuesday to Friday often tend to blur together nowadays (especially post-COVID hybrid), and it'd be nice to have that option.* https://teddybaldassarre.com/en-ca/blogs/watches/day-date-wa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633005</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I add that outside of the political commentary because thats mainly the only reason this is on hackernews.There are mounting challenges in climate tech - specifically in residential solar:
1.  Residential solar has been under punishing economic headwinds.  Tariffs (before this) against imported PV. The market has not been performing.
2.  Many of the Public Utilities are making it very difficult for solar to work out financially for home owners - see CPUC in California changing the terms of NEM to the advantage of the Utilities as an example.
3.  Energy storage in residential markets has ALWAYS been an insurance product/backup power and not a financially beneficial product.  It is tough competition against generators etc
4.  Utilities are wisening up and increasing their fees and reducing the benefits of on site power generation.  
5.  Residential solar has likely already found all the best home owners (ie lowest CAC) so are now pursuing harder to reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I heard a former Solar City marketing person talk about it. He said when Tesla bought them back, Musk cancelled all of the marketing budget. Musks justification was that marketing was a waste of money and he could get more sales via a single free tweet.He then proceeded to not tweet about that part of his business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marques Brownlee had a system put in and ran it for a year. It was ok but cost $120k which seems a bit steep.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Garfield Minus Garfield" features a unique twist on the classic comic strip "Garfield" by removing the titular character, Garfield, from the panels. This alteration shifts the focus to Jon Arbuckle, showcasing his existential thoughts and quirky interactions in a more profound, often humorous light. The resulting strips highlight themes of loneliness and absurdity, transforming the originally humorous comic into a commentary on modern life and relationships. The site serves as a collection of these reimagined comics, inviting visitors to explore this unconventional interpretation of a familiar cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;

As a crew member on the USS Salt Lake City (SSN-716), we took many of the cast and crew out to sea for 24 hours before they made the movie to get a feel for what sub-life was like before they made the movie. All the cast and crew were great, and I think it made the movie better.Actor Scott Glenn, who plays the Captain of Dallas, modeled his character after our Captain, Tom Fargo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rjO_VrESNoIt is a great movie!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a quick note that this film really holds up, like weirdly well given its subject and vintage. If you haven't watched it in a long time, add it to your list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Off topic, but always amazed me that the Russian submarine in this film has a swimming pool (more like a plunge pool) but still seems wild.https://youtu.be/JrULRXlAlMU?si=kvh64qy64E7aqXPY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43641469</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's journey towards taking control of personal data by implementing a self-hosted calendar solution. It details the challenges and steps they faced while integrating this solution, emphasizing the importance of privacy and autonomy in data management. The author outlines the technical aspects of setting up the calendar, including software selection and configuration, while also reflecting on the broader implications of owning one’s data in an increasingly digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know I will probably get pushback over this, but CalDAV sucks.  People say that it's great and that it's easy; yet if that were true there would be way more self-hosted CalDAV solutions out there and they would be far more ergonomic than what's available.  I was not impressed with Radicale.  Because there's really only one calendar file I wanted to serve to myself, I tried implementing my own CalDAV server just for that purpose and pretty much gave up because of how unintuitive and complicated it was merely to make a single file available.  I can see why it would be needed if sharing a calendar with other people with calendar apps that support CalDAV, but I think it's kind of a waste of time if hosting a calendar for one's self.Instead, initially went with the approach of hosting my dynamically updating iCal file in an S3 bucket and using ICSx5 on Android to sync with it.  No CalDAV needed – just HTTPS.However, FOSS calendars for Android still suck, and for some reason I couldn't get ICSx5 to work within GrapheneOS, so I now use almost the same approach but with Proton Calendar which happens to support calendars from direct links to iCal files.  It's not perfect, but it suits my needs enough.I think the author's approach for using iCalendar format is a good one, though what I've discovered is the amount of support for various iCalendar features varies drastically between calendar software.  Rather than dealing with that headache, I somewhat gave up and decided to shove most metadata into the description field rather than use the respective properties.EDIT: My use case is software I wrote to grab data from various sites (Eventbrite, Meetup, pub trivia companies, public event calendars, etc.), filter for only social events I would be interested in, and combine them into a single calendar I can view in my normal calendar software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another CalDav server I can recommend is Radicale.
It's written in python and designed in a pretty modular way,
enabling authentication and authorization (and more) plugins.Data is saved in plain text files and I track/backup it using git.Over the time I've accumulated some interesting modifications:- Authentication runs with pam on the host system.- To enable sharing of calendars I run a periodic script symlinking the calendars to all authorized users. Unfortunately this suffers from combinatiorial explosion.- Using a rights plugin with custom CalDav Attributes and a modified web plugin I added
support for access Control Lists.- To enable public calendars you give read permissions to the `public` user using ACL.
Then a nginx hack gives blanket acces for read operations:  location /public {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:{%RADICALE_PORT%};
      include proxy_params;
      proxy_set_header Authorization "Basic {%RADICALE_PUBLIC_AUTH%}";
      proxy_hide_header Authorization;
      add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin * always;
      add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, OPTIONS, PROPFIND";
      add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Depth";
      limit_except GET OPTIONS PROPFIND { deny all; }
  }

These public calendars are can be viewed on a web calendar (https://gitlab.nomagic.uk/popi/js_calendar_from_ics)I should probably write a blog post about the setup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly the post I've needed.I have two calendars, one on my personal server running Mailcow (SoGO) and my work calendar with Fastmail.They don't work together- I've never found a way to get mailcow's calendar to work with other tools well, and so I spend time syncing between them semi-manually.I've wanted to de-couple the calendar for a while but the only alternative I knew about was Nextcloud, which I think is a bit heavy weight.This Baïkal looks great and I can't wait to give it a try. Doing this will also allow me to explore changing out Mailcow for another self-hosted mail service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643343</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the technique of tapping cheese wheels, a practice used to assess the quality and consistency of cheese. The sound produced when tapping can indicate various characteristics of the cheese, such as density and moisture content. The method is commonly employed by cheese makers and connoisseurs to ensure that the cheese has aged appropriately and to identify any flaws. The piece also highlights the importance of this sensory evaluation in the broader context of cheese production and tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of the story about Charles Proteus Steinmetz diagnosing the problem inside a generator at Henry Ford's auto plant just by listening to it very carefully."Ford, whose electrical engineers couldn’t solve some problems they were having with a gigantic generator, called Steinmetz in to the plant. Upon arriving, Steinmetz rejected all assistance and asked only for a notebook, pencil and cot. According to Scott, Steinmetz listened to the generator and scribbled computations on the notepad for two straight days and nights. On the second night, he asked for a ladder, climbed up the generator and made a chalk mark on its side. Then he told Ford’s skeptical engineers to remove a plate at the mark and replace sixteen windings from the field coil. They did, and the generator performed to perfection.Henry Ford was thrilled until he got an invoice from General Electric in the amount of $10,000. Ford acknowledged Steinmetz’s success but balked at the figure. He asked for an itemized bill.Steinmetz ... responded personally to Ford’s request with the following:Making chalk mark on generator $1.Knowing where to make mark $9,999.Ford paid the bill."https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/charles-proteus-stein...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am glad that this continues to be done by hand, and expect, based on Italian attitudes towards food and tradition, that it will continue being done by hand for another hundred years.It is interesting how important it seems to us that jobs like this remain done in the traditional way. For all their expertise, I am sure a technical solution would also easily be able to detect what they are looking for: voids within the cheese, or lack of uniform density. This does not seem to be a case where the human expertise and artistry is actually important to the final product, besides the feeling of tradition.Perhaps the best argument for keeping traditional jobs like this is that, even if that exact job could be done by machine, replacing these humans with machines would be the start of a short process that would end up with indistrially-produced bad cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably I'm biased because I'm Italian and I grew up eating them, but Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano are hands down the best cheeses there can be. Many people know and consume them only grated on pasta dishes, but they are especially delicious on their own with some good bread or grilled polenta.Also, the crust can be chopped up and added to risotto (as you're cooking it) and they turn into wonderful little chewy chunks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644970</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide for new developers interested in programming with Haiku, an open-source operating system inspired by BeOS. It outlines various resources, tools, and libraries available for development, encouraging users to familiarize themselves with C++ programming, the Haiku Application Programming Interface (API), and the operating system's unique features. The piece emphasizes community involvement and offers suggestions for getting started with projects, including links to tutorials, documentation, and forums, thus aiming to foster a supportive environment for learning and growth in Haiku programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat tangential: this reminded me of Neal Stephenson's "In the Beginning was the Command Line" [1] which speaks highly of BeOS.I liked the bug report "R4: BeOS missing megalomaniacal figurehead to harness and focus developer rage" (:[1] https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because Haiku has taken such an extraordinarily long time, as with a city centre that was constructed over multiple centuries we can see the clear lines of new work with new techniques and materials on top of old work done in a way that was usual at the time.Haiku has a lot of C++ 98 code or even pre-standard C++, not least all the stuff re-used with permission from BeOS. As was usual for projects at that time many fundamental building blocks are provided rather than using a language standard. For example there's BString and BList.Haiku also has seams of BSD code where there'd be a project to do Whatever (WiFi, TLS, drivers, etc.) "properly" in a way unique to Haiku but as a stop gap here's some BSD code until we finish our own proper solution, which of course never happens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haiku's approach to teaching programming is refreshing - starting with real-world GUI apps right away rather than console exercises. Their simple API design makes this possible while still conveying fundamental concepts through tangible, visual results. A great example of how OS architecture can influence learning outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640403</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses six key usability improvements introduced in GCC 15, highlighting enhancements that aim to streamline the development experience for programmers. These improvements include better diagnostics for compiler errors and warnings, improved handling of common coding patterns, enhancements to the compiler's optimization capabilities, more informative output for users, integration of new language features, and enhancements to code generation efficiency. The overall focus is on making GCC more user-friendly and efficient for developers while maintaining its robust performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Usability improvement request for this article: don't hijack the browser back button :P&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using a hierarchy to show template errors is brilliant and I'm sort of surprised compilers haven't always done that.I was investigating C++-style templates for a hobby language of mine and SFINAE is an important property to make them work in realistic codebases, but leads to exactly this problem. When a compile error occurs, there isn't a single cause, or even a linear chain of causes, but an potentially arbitrarily large tree of them.For example, it sees a call to foo() and there is a template foo(). It tries to instantiate that but the body of foo() calls bar(). It tries to resolve that and finds a template bar() which it tries to instantiate, and so on.The compiler is basically searching the entire tree of possible instantiations/overloads and backtracking when it hits dead ends.Showing that tree as a tree makes a lot of sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With GCC error messages usually the only part I wanna see is "required from here" and yet it spams zillions of "note: ...". With the nesting enabled, it's way easier to read --- just look at the top indentation level. Hooray!!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643886</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ai part of the app is basically useless. After 2 hours of “vibe coding” a chess clock flutter app I got basically nothing in the end.It broke more and more each message. I tried fixing stuff myself but it would mess it up again.
Would not recommend anyone to use it.Now for the non ai part: super cool. I love the nix environment. Its fascinating how they handle the previews for example. I got geekbench up and running an the cpu is a bit worse than an iphone 15 pro max, but it has 32 gigs of ram!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's my short review after playing around with Firebase Studio for ~30 minutes. First of all, I had to turn off Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection because otherwise projects wouldn't load.I gave it the following initial prompt:&gt; An app where you input a question, then flip some coins to generate an I Ching prediction, and it generates a prediction / fortune for you. Then this combination of results can be fed to Gemini AI to produce a more detailed prediction text.It generated something that looked fine. When I input a question and press the button nothing happened. After asking it to fix the problem multiple times and having it fail, I looked at the browser console to figure out the errors it was getting. Then I copied those errors and told it to fix them. After a few iterations, it solved every error and would generate a result. It completely forgot the part where you are supposed to flip coins before getting a hexagram to generate a fortune. After a bit of prompting, I was able to get it to display the hexagram and input question. However, sometimes it becomes confused about which hexagram was generated.Overall, my impression is that these tools are still in the toy novelty stage rather than something you'd want to use for anything important.Here is a screenshot of the app output for the question: Will Hacker News like my vibe coded oracle? [0] As you can see, it says that the generated hexagram is 24 or 41, but in the fortune text below it says 11.[0] https://files.catbox.moe/i8t7rw.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a person currently working on a project that uses Firestore (the db component of Firebase), there is one thing - and only one thing - I want.A web GUI for Firestore that lets me work on documents like, idk, any other DBMS GUI would: the ability to select multiple records, and operate on them.That's literally it. I don't need AI, I don't need dark mode, I don't even need MongoDB compatibility. I just want to select multiple documents with my mouse and do things to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43635783</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who are curious, `...` is a placeholder value in Python called Ellipsis. I don't believe it serves any real purpose other than being a placeholder. But it is an object and it implements `__eq__`, and is considered equal to itself. So `...==...` evaluates to `True`. When you prefix a `True` with `-`, it is interpreted as a prefix negation operator and implicitly converts the `True` to a `1`, so `-(...==...)` is equal to `-1`. Then, you add another prefix `-` to turn the `-1` back into `1`.`--(...==...)--(...==...)` evaluates to `2` because the first block evaluates to 1, as previously mentioned, and then the next `-` is interpreted as an infix subtraction operator. The second `-(...==...)` evaluates to `-1`, so you get `1 - -1` or `2`.When chaining multiple together, you can leave off the initial `--`, because booleans will be implicitly converted to integers if inserted into an arithmetic expression, e.g. `True - -1` -&gt; `1 - -1` -&gt; `2`.&gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.This article is obviously completely tongue-in-cheek, but I feel the need to point out that this sentence is not meant to be a complete inversion of the Perl philosophy of TIMTOWTDI. The word "obvious" is crucial here - there can be more than one way, but ideally only one of the ways is obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can do this on JavaScript too.  alert(1)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the size of enumeration (enum) types in various programming languages, exploring how different languages implement enum types and the implications for memory usage and performance. It highlights that while some languages have a fixed size for enums, others allow for more flexibility, which can lead to differences in how enums are stored and accessed in memory. The author provides comparisons and examples to illustrate these variations, ultimately emphasizing the importance of knowing an enum's size for optimal programming practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great way to see why invalid UTF-8 strings and unicode chars cause undefined behaviour in Rust. `char` is a special integer type, known to have a valid range which is a sub-range of its storage type. Outside of dataless enums, this is the only datatype with this behaviour (EDIT: I neglected NonZero&lt;...&gt;/NonZeroXXX and some other zero-niche types).If you manage to construct an invalid char from an invalid string or any other way, you can defeat the niche optimization code and accidentally create yourself an unsound transmute, which is game over for soundness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This actually is niche optimization. The outer enum is using the niches available in the tag of the inner enum for its own discriminant.The author seems to have a limited understanding of niche optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think it's actually "flattening" the enums discriminant spaces (though maybe it is). My guess is this is just 32-bit alignment requirement (ie. bytes 1:4 are padding) + sub-byte discriminant sizes. The surprising thing here is that the ordering of Outer's variants doesn't match the ordering as defined, instead having variant D's discriminant be 0 (0 &lt;&lt; size_of::&lt;Inner's discriminant&gt;). size_of::&lt;Inner&gt; is actually 33 bits and size_of::&lt;Outer&gt; is 34 bits and then you just apply alignment requirements to each field. Actual size_of calls will account for alignment and padding, but the compiler knows the truth.What's cool about this in general is nested match statements can be flattened into a jumplist (idk if rustc does this, but it's possible in theory).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616649</guid></item><item><title>15.

https://amendhub.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering what I could do with it ... I rewrote Glypha (an old Mac shareware game I wrote) using modern SDL2. Might be fun to try to "back port" (?) it to OS 9 on top of SDL2 (rather than the clunkier CopyBits() calls I used in the original shareware game).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks neat! SDL seems open to supporting legacy platforms, so hopefully it'll get mainlined at some point (at this point, may be more likely if they port SDL3 though, SDL2 is in maintenance mode). Does anyone know if it's possible to use a new compiler for this rather than CodeWarrior 7? It would make it easier to port stuff to Mac OS 9 if you don't also have to deal with the compiler only supporting old C/C++ standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43645183</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Demystifying the Shebang" explains the purpose and functionality of the shebang (`#!`) in scripts, particularly in Unix-like operating systems. It describes how the shebang specifies the interpreter that should be used to execute the script, allowing users to run scripts without explicitly invoking the interpreter in the command line. The article also discusses various shebang examples, the implications of using different interpreters, and best practices for ensuring scripts function correctly across different environments. Overall, it aims to clarify common misconceptions about the shebang and its significance in scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646698"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: you can stick a null byte into the shebang line to terminate it, as an alterantive to the newline.It's possible to have a scripting language support extra command line arguments after the null byte, which is less disruptive to the syntax than recognizing arguments from a second line.I.e.  #!/path/to/interpreter --arg&lt;NUL&gt;--more --args&lt;LF&gt;

Or  #!/usr/bin/env interpreter&lt;NUL&gt;--all --args&lt;LF&gt;

On some OS's, you only get one arg: everything after the space, to the end of the line, is one argument.When we stick a &lt;NUL&gt; there, that argument stops there; but our interpreter can read the whole line including the &lt;NUL&gt; up to the &lt;LF&gt; and then extract additional arguments between &lt;NUL&gt; and &lt;LF&gt;https://www.nongnu.org/txr/txr-manpage.html#N-74C247FDThe interpreter could get the arguments in other ways, like from a second line after the hash bang line. But with the null hack, all the processing revolves around just the one hash bang line. You can retrofit this logic into an interpreter that already knows how to ignore the hash bang line, without doing any work beyond getting it to load the line properly with the embedded nul, and extract the arguments. You dont have to alter the syntax to specially recognize a hash bang continuation line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you found this article interesting, you might also enjoy "My Own Private Binary: An Idiosyncratic Introduction to Linux Kernel Modules"[0] and the previous discussion[1] of it on HN.[0]: https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/mopb.html[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29291804&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read your article, it's really nice. I really feel much less demystified by this.But can you / somebody please explain what this meansAccording to the official Kernel Admin Guide:This Kernel feature allows you to invoke almost (for restrictions see below) every program by simply typing its name in the shell. This includes for example compiled Java(TM), Python or Emacs programs. To achieve this you must tell binfmt_misc which interpreter has to be invoked with which binary. Binfmt_misc recognises the binary-type by matching some bytes at the beginning of the file with a magic byte sequence (masking out specified bits) you have supplied. Binfmt_misc can also recognise a filename extension aka .com or .exe.It’s another way to tell the Kernel what interpreter to run when invoking a program that’s not native (ELF). For scripts (text files) we mostly use a shebang, but for byte-coded binaries, such as Java’s JAR or Mono EXE files, it’s the way to go!Like, can you give me an example by what you mean. What are its use cases, if any. I read it many times and always with some sort of enthusiasm because of this sentence ending in exclamation point making me feel like it's huge yet I just can't understand it's significance.Does it mean we can have .jar files which can then run shebang like, so we don't need #! , can this also be used for main.go or every other language which has some issues with #! ,I see there being some interpreter for golang, rust etc. which just compiles it but it was just too complex. I am just imagining something like a simple go file which is valid golang but can be run by linux simply by ./ And it autocompiles it...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646698</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;PEP 750 proposes the addition of a pattern matching feature to the Python programming language, allowing for more expressive and concise handling of complex data structures. The document outlines the motivations behind implementing this feature, the syntax and semantics proposed, and potential use cases. It emphasizes that pattern matching would enhance the clarity of code and improve the expressiveness of Python, making it easier for developers to work with various data types and structures effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fascinating how differently languages approach the string formatting design space.- Java's been trying to add f/t-strings, but its designers appear to be perfectionists to a fault, unable to accept anything that doesn't solve every single problem possible to imagine: [1].- Go developers seem to have taken no more than 5 minutes considering the problem, then thoughtlessly discarded it: [2]. A position born from pure ignorance as far as I'm concerned.- Python, on the other hand, has consistently put forth a balanced approach of discussing each new way of formatting strings for some time, deciding on a good enough implementation and going with it.In the end, I find it hard to disagree with Python's approach. Its devs have been able to get value from first the best variant of sprintf in .format() since 2008, f-strings since 2016, and now t-strings.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40737095[2]: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34174#issuecomment-14509...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nick Humrich here, the author who helped rewrite PEP 501 to introduce t-strings, which was the foundation for this PEP. I am not an author on this accepted PEP, but I know this PEP and story pretty well. Let me know if you have any questions.I am super excited this is finally accepted. I started working on PEP 501 4 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most excellent! I love f-strings and replaced all the various other string interpolation instances in my code with them, but they have the significant issue that you can't defer evaluating them. For instance, you can write:  &gt;&gt;&gt; template = 'Hello, {name}'
  &gt;&gt;&gt; template.format(name='Bob')
  'Hello, Bob'

Until this, there wasn't a way to use f-strings formatting without interpolating the results at that moment:  &gt;&gt;&gt; template = f'Hello, {name}'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "&lt;python-input-5&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      template = f'Hello, {name}'
                           ^^^^
  NameError: name 'name' is not defined

It was annoying being able to use f-strings almost everywhere, but str.format in enough odd corners that you have to put up with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647716</guid></item><item><title>20.

I feel like this may partially go against a very basic fact about intelligence that was recently stated by Ilya (but is common sense): the more intelligent the model the harder it is to control it. You can remove elephants and force other basic behavioral changes, but the strength of artificial free will (so to speak) of these models is correlated with their intelligence, and this does not reduce it, so it will come out in other ways. If you do manage to control it fully then you will have a model as dumb as a brick. The whole point of intelligent machines is their independent thought. The more intelligent, the more independent thinking will emerge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646466</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses parser combinators as a more effective alternative to regular expressions for parsing complex data and text. It explains that while regular expressions can be powerful for simple patterns, they often become unwieldy for intricate structures due to their limitations. The author illustrates how parser combinators allow for more modular, readable, and maintainable parsing strategies by composing simple parsers into more complex ones. This approach enhances clarity and provides better error handling, making it a valuable tool for developers dealing with advanced parsing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parser combinators are one of those ideas that is really powerful in practice, but will never be mainstream because it had the bad fortune of coming from the functional programming world. It's a shame too, because parser combinators are what made parsers click for me.Take the hard problem of parsing a language, break it down into the much simpler problem of reading tokens, then write simple "combinators" (and, or, one_or_many, etc etc) to combine these simple parsers into larger more complex parsers.You could almost build an entire parser combinator library from scratch from memory, because none of the individual components are complicated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are numerous posts, comments, articles and so forth about when to use regex versus using a parser. The general rule is this:If you need to do a search from a string, such as needle(s) from a hat stack, regex is probably more ideal than a parser. If you need anything more intelligent than a list of search results you probably want a full formal parser.Most languages allow a form of nested regex that allow for increased search precision. This occurs when a method that makes use of a regex returns to a function whose argument is a matching string result, which is why regex is probably enough when the business is primitive. There is a tremendously higher cost to using a full parser, considering the lexer and tokenizer plus rules, but it’s so much more intelligent that it’s not even comparable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It uses the pcre-heavy Haskell library which in turn calls out to the system-wide pcre C library for actually compiling and running the regex.That's not true regular expressions, but a backtracker with eclectic features.The regex used in the regex solution is just:  mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)

not requiring PCRE.If Haskell happens to provide bindings to the POSIX regcomp/regexec stuff, that would be something to try instead. \d has to be replaced with [0-9], needless to say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43638422</guid></item><item><title>22.

I get it has a lot of features but it's hard to get past the "it's a $250 busy indicator".Not that I'd spend $250, but even something like that sold more as an open device to be used for a lot of different things changes (for the better) the value proposition in my mind a little than just sold as a busy sign with lots of integrations.   Granted ... this appears to be that too.  That's more a of a commentary on perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't buy this because of the price tag but I love the industrial design of this thing! I wish there were more things like this (albeit more practical) that I would like to upgrade my desk with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently set up a "busy" indicator using Home Assistant (HA) and the Home Assistant Companion app for macOS.

It does seem like the first week or so of being a customer, support prioritizes your questions. Wait a month or so, then reach out to support or sales - and see how you won’t even get an acknowledgment. I only say this as a paying customer rooting for your company success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare seems to be the only company in the world where sales does not want to speak to you. So if Arroyo becomes part of the Cloudflare Enterprise offering, dont get your hopes up to be able to use it. Except maybe if you are already a Cloudflare Enterprise customer.I have tried now for over a month to open an enterprise account with them, no luck yet. I filed tickets, called their hotline, but I just cannot get through to a sales person.Are there any alternatives out there that provide a baseline of support and allow sending PHI data?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations, second streaming acquisition in recent memory, after benthos.Arroyo on paper looks amazing, high performance, advanced streaming primitives like windows and joins.I think / hope the foundations provide a long term alternative to flink and spark streaming, the extremely heavy jvm-based incumbents.I only have ~5 hours of experience with it so def an ultra beginner, but it was very UI configuration heavy when I tried it. API based config was mentioned but didn’t slot into the way $dayjob provisions so it was a very hard sell.In response to this I created a lightweight high performance dev-centric streaming solution powered by duckdb, it’s getting a little tractionhttps://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flowIceberg has been one of the most popular feature so far:https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/iceberg-sink&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643968</guid></item><item><title>24.

Most new Rails services use them.It's a good match because accessibility is one of the Design Systems' primary concerns so JavaScript is used very sparingly and only to enhance.They're not official, only Nunjucks is supported by the Design System team.https://design-system.service.gov.uk/https://govuk-form-builder.netlify.app/https://govuk-components.netlify.app/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across CSS Zero recently:https://csszero.lazaronixon.com/lookbook/pages/overviewwhich bills itself as an "opinionated front-end starter kit" specifically for Rails and includes Stimulus.js code for JavaScript functionality.It seems the benefits are that it is no build (pure CSS with CSS variables) and easy to modify and extend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totally get the struggle — I spent way too many hours figuring which design system should I use for my next project.

They don't need to collude with any adversarial government for this to be true.The same tools built to manipulate people into buying things, are used to manipulate them into thinking and acting in ways that could be beneficial to someone. Advertising and propaganda use the same tactics, after all. When these tools are accessible to anyone, including political adversaries, it would be naive to think that they're not being used for information warfare.The Cambridge Analytica leak was just the tip of the iceberg. These companies and agencies are still operating at a global scale, and business is booming. Why adtech companies weren't heavily investigated and regulated after this became public is beyond me. These are matters of national security, which anyone sane would consider more important than any financial or practical value they might have.Banning TikTok was a step in the right direction, but that's far from the only service that needs to be heavily regulated. And even that decision is flip-flopped and very controversial, so the idea of going beyond must be unthinkable. Yet not doing so will lead to the eventual downfall of the US, and the current western hegemony. The instability we're seeing now is just the beginning, and my only hope is that it doesn't escalate to a major global conflict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; They have threatened her with $50,000 in punitive damages every time she mentions Facebook in public … even if the statements she is making are true,” he said.Unless Congress asks for the testimony, which is probably why Meta tried to stop the hearing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Hawley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Crime and Counterterrorism Subcommittee, said that Meta or Facebook tried "desperately to prevent" him from holding the hearing."They have threatened her with $50,000 in punitive damages every time she mentions Facebook in public ... even if the statements she is making are true," he said.  "Facebook is attempting her total and complete financial ruin. They're attempting to destroy her personally, they're attempting to destroy her reputation and I think the question is, `Why?'""What is it they are so afraid of?"

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a perspective by renowned science fiction writer Isaac Asimov on the impact of artificial intelligence on human creativity. Asimov believed that AI would not replace humans but instead free them from mundane tasks, allowing individuals to focus on their creative pursuits. He envisaged a future where machines handle routine work, leading to a society where people can engage in artistic and intellectual endeavors. The piece reflects on Asimov's insights regarding the potential positive transformation brought about by advancements in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;LLMs are statistical models trained on human-generated text. They aren't the perfectly logical "machine brains" that Asimov and others imagined.The upshot of this is that LLMs are quite good at the stuff that he thinks only humans will be able to do. What they aren't so good at (yet) is really rigorous reasoning, exactly the opposite of what 20th century people assumed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Isaac Asimov describes artificial intelligence as “a phrase that we use for any device that does things which, in the past, we have associated only with human intelligence.”This is a pretty good definition, honestly. It explains the AI Effect quite well: calculators aren’t “AI” because it’s been a while since humans were the only ones who could do arithmetic. At one point they were, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny thing About Asimov was how he came up with the laws of robotics and then cases on how they don't work. 
There are a few that I remember, one where a robot was lying because a bug in his brain gave him empathy and he didn't want to hurt humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644179</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "The Columbian Orator," a significant 19th-century textbook that served as a guide for Americans in mastering the art of eloquence and public speaking. Compiled by James P. Campbell and first published in 1797, the book featured a collection of speeches, dialogues, and essays, which provided not only rhetorical techniques but also themes of liberty, justice, and social change. It played a crucial role in shaping the oratory skills of influential figures during the time, including abolitionists and other reformers, and highlighted the importance of effective communication in advocating for social causes.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the relationship between probability, randomness, and how they impact systems governed by queues, such as in service industries. It discusses the use of dice as a metaphor for chance and decision-making, examining how these concepts can influence outcomes in both simple and complex scenarios. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics in order to optimize processes and improve efficiency in various applications. Additionally, the piece reflects on the philosophical implications of randomness and the nature of decision-making in uncertain environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not explicitly mentioned in the article, but the arrival rate and queue sizes are related via Little's Law [0] — the average number of people in a system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the mean wait time, regardless of the arrival distribution, service distribution, or service order (e.g. FIFO, LIFO, random).I was fortunate enough to take some great queueing theory classes in college, and fondly remember flailing about in Simio [1] trying to get a bank teller simulation to work. Really useful stuff to learn, although it did make me incredibly susceptible to Factorio and similar games.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCzAhKtucck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In an ideal world, we wouldn’t need queues. Who likes waiting in lines after all? This would only be possible if the arrival rate of items in a queue was less than or equal to the departure rate and there were no variability in either. Not likely to happen in the real world.It's not only possible if there's no variability. It's only possible if the arrival rate is always less than number of available processing slots, which can be engineered in a number of ways. (e.g. ensuring that the number of processing units is oversupplied, i.e. exceeds the maximum arrival rate + departure rate; or altering number of processing units dynamically so that utilisation never exceeds 80%.)However, these approaches are generally not the lowest cost approaches, and so are only used when queueing is incredibly undesirable, e.g. when the cost of maintaining the queue exceeds the cost of holding the spare capacity.One example for oversupply is airports - most airports have enough gates that incoming aircraft never have to queue, despite that meaning that many gates are empty for most of the day.For dynamically adjusting capacity examples include listening thread pools for network applications which can spin up new waiting threads whenever the pool free count drops below a certain threshold (the threshold being decided based on the maximum arrival rate). Or a cloud service which spins up new servers whenever cpu utilisation exceeds 80%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simulation of queue behavior where you can intuitively get a feeling of what happens: https://queuewiz.queuemetrics.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640115</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The generations in my family are full of people who had dementia/Alzheimer's/auto-immune disorders.  They all had anxiety, and they all had sleep disorders - I'm certain there is a connection among it all.I joined a Stanford study and had a spinal tap sample submitted for testing - in theory I am "unlikely" to develop anything for the next 20 years - but that only gets me to my late 60's :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially related, but very important to me and hopefully helpful to others here: I have sleep apnea. So do most of the men in my family. Though I am overweight, I haven't always been, but I have always had the condition, as have they. For those who don't know, sleep apnea is a condition where you stop breathing in your sleep, wake up slightly to fix that and start breathing again, and then fall back asleep. It sounds like choking in your sleep. In my case, I was doing this more than 70 times an hour - often multiple times a minute! My blood oxygen was as low as 67% - a threshold that would have me on a ventilator, were it happening in a hospital.Until I got my apnea treated, I never slept well. I had not had a really good night's sleep in years, and I hadn't had a great night's sleep as an adult probably ever. In school - decades ago - I fell asleep in class regularly and napped every day. Despite this, I have been successful, but I can't help but wonder who I'd be if I hadn't had that problem. What's worse, because you do not actually sleep, whatever happens during sleep that repairs your body doesn't really happen. Sleep apnea massively increases your risk for heart disease, stroke, and many other serious conditions.Sleep apnea is treated with CPAP - continuous positive airway pressure - from a machine that sits on your bedside. You wear a mask like Bane and it forces air into your throat and opens it, making it easier to breathe. CPAP is not a cure, because it doesn't fix the underlying anatomical issue, but properly calibrated it results in complete remission. I now sleep normally. From a sleep perspective, I feel amazing, better than I have in years. For the first time in my life, I can rely on feeling good in the morning if I get enough hours of sleep in. Even four hours on the CPAP is better than eight or nine hours without it. (Also, over time, your brain becomes conditioned that CPAP = sleep, and you zonk out within minutes of putting it on.)It is costly and time consuming, yes, and CPAP machines are a huge lifestyle adjustment. But good lord, is it worth it. I have never felt or slept better. In the years since my diagnosis I have not slept a single night without my CPAP and I don't think I ever will again, unless some magical cure comes out.If you have struggled with insomnia, snoring, or feeling wakeful after sleep, I beg you to get a sleep study and look into whether apnea, or another similar condition, could be the cause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant to this, people with a genetic mutation that adversely affects sleep end up developing dementia and dying early:https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25001-fatal-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643390</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always charmed by museums that feel like this sort of "weird collection". The trend seems to be firmly away from it, however. During the time I lived in London, the Horniman museum reorganized itself and became "respectible" in the process. While I was living in Exeter the RAMM did the same thing. If you have a similar taste, I strongly recommend visiting the Pitt-Rivers museum in Oxford: it's a truly bizarre collection of absolutely amazing objects - or it was the last time I was there; if it's since been re-curated along modern lines, then you'll have missed a uniquely odd experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're ever in LA (Culver City), see if you can get into The Museum of Jurassic Technology. Some things are well documented, if not believable.https://www.mjt.org/themainpage/main2.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off topic but if you are looking for a cabinet of curiosities for aircraft, visit the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California. It has a collection that includes some truly marvelous flying machines.My favorite is a collapsible helicopter that folds up into a duffel bag for transport. [0] It was designed to be airdropped to pilots downed behind enemy lines. The pilot was meant to assemble it and fly back to safety. It could fly but not well enough to see actual service in combat.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiller_ROE_Rotorcycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601282</guid></item><item><title>31. .localhost Domains</title><link>https://inclouds.space/localhost-domains</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of localhost domains, which are essential for local development and testing of web applications. It explains how localhost allows developers to run applications on their own machines without needing an internet connection, highlighting the advantages of using localhost for debugging and testing. The piece provides practical insights on setting up localhost domains, including configuring host files and using tools like local servers for efficient web development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: browsers also give you a Secure Context for .localhost domains.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure...So you don't need self signed certs for HTTPS on local if you want to, for example, have a backend API and a frontend SPA running at the same time talking to eachother on your machine (authentication for example requires a secure context if doing OAuth2).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might check out .internal instead which was recently approved [1] for local use.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.internal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This nginx local dev config snippet is one-and-done:  # Proxy to a backend server based on the hostname.
  if (-d vhosts/$host) {
    proxy_pass http://unix:vhosts/$host/server.sock;
    break;
  }

Your local dev servers must listen on a unix domain socket, and you must drop a symlink to them at eg /var/lib/nginx/vhosts/inclouds.localhost/server.sock.Not a single command, and you still have to add hostname resolution. But you don't have to programmatically edit config files or restart the proxy to stand up a new dev server!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644043</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the way LLM-enhanced coding should (and I believe will) go.Treating the LLM like a compiler is a much more scalable, extensible and composable mental model than treating it like a junior dev.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. I implemented something similar for personal use before.At that time, LLMs weren't as proficient in coding as they are today. Nowadays, the decorator approach might even go further and not just wrap LLM calls but also write Python code based on the description in the Docstring.This would incentivize writing unambiguous DocStrings, and guarantee (if the LLMs don't hallucinate) consistency between code and documentation.It would bring us closer to the world that Jensen Huang described, i.e., natural language becoming a programming language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like how this integrates with the schema feature I added to the underlying LLM Python library a few weeks ago: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/#using-sch...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619884</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the essential principle of valuing one’s work and the importance of compensation in professional settings. The author reflects on personal experiences and insights regarding the dynamics of work and payment, emphasizing that requiring payment for services is crucial for maintaining professionalism and a healthy work-life balance. By illustrating instances where unpaid work leads to exploitation and lack of motivation, the author advocates for setting boundaries and recognizing the worth of one’s skills in the career landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a client fall behind on my consulting work by about $75K for a software product I was writing for them. I negotiated a revenue sharing agreement of 10% and we would call things even while I finished the application. I finished and was paid about $2M over ten years, with almost no work done for those years.Then before Covid they needed more work done (customers and revenue were dropping because no updates to the application) so I negotiated part ownership of the company and have been working full-time on it since to try to increase revenue.So yes, no pay, no work. But pay doesn’t have to be a paycheck. That said, I could be getting paid more right now if I was working in a more traditional role in a more traditional and larger company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you work for startups, especially boot-strapped startups, there will always be cash-flow constraints sooner or later.Personally it came about a year into my first job. Fortunately my wife was working, and we had minimal expenses, so we could ride it out.In lieu of salary, the founders made me a partner. We sank or swam together. And when cash came in we paid ourselves.Make no mistake, deciding to stay was a very risky strategy. But a few years later things took off, we got back-paid all that missing salary, and we've gotten stronger since.I was lucky. I didn't need the immediate cash, and could take a risk. The most likely outcome was we went under. But the upside turned out to be very strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first client in video games was the same. They rarely paid their contractors on time (the payment was months late), or it wasn't the entire agreed sum. We kept sending in late payment notices to their finance guy, and they fired us all for being troublemakers. I believe I had a notice period of two weeks, but they fired me with one day's notice.Suing them was out of the question. For me, as for others, it would have been international. The company was in Italy, and the contractors were all over Europe. We'd probably each spend over 10k euros on the proceedings and representation in Italian courts. And the company wasn't overdue by much more than that. Besides, even if we won and the court ruled our legal expenses were to be paid, we weren't sure the company was solvent enough. So no one sued.I believe it was their modus operandi. The company continued firing their contractors when it got into arrears before a lawsuit made sense. Sometimes, it's just their business plan.I agree with the article's author—no pay, no work. Before starting contract work, one should think about the line they won't cross regarding late payments. For me, it's when an invoice becomes overdue, and it's plainly a breach of contract. I will never again cross that line and keep working.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639871</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "suffering-oriented programming," which emphasizes the importance of designing software that gracefully handles errors and failures. It argues that developers should anticipate challenges and create systems that can recover from issues instead of relying on perfect conditions. By embracing suffering in programming, developers can build more resilient and robust applications that provide a better user experience in the face of unexpected problems. The author also offers insights on how to implement these principles effectively in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a similar philosophy for the systems I manage. We have always been severely understaffed, so I treat any user support request that repeats twice as a bug.If the decision to push a button is yours, I'll give you the button. If you need some data more than once, you get a button too. My ideal user never needs to know who manages the system or how to contact us.This has even got me a "why do you guys have almost no tickets? You aren't doing anything!" talk a couple times. Music for my ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm doing this with the SaaS I'm building (outside of my day job). My URL endpoint functions were directly executing SQL on the database until I decided that I couldn't go on like this, and only then did I write some classes to represent the business logic objects. It sounds ridiculous, but it gave me the flexibility to experiment with what those objects should do before imposing a formalism on them, and I found that very valuable.At my day job, I'm expected to use TDD, and I don't like it. It's not that I don't like tests - I don't like writing them, but I like it when they're there, so I write them while feeling a bit grumpy. My problem with TDD is that I'm a big picture thinker, and I start from the inputs and work incrementally towards the outputs, without having a good outline of how I'm going to get there, so I can't write unit tests before writing any actual code, because I don't know what the units are going to be yet.I also find my colleagues' code to be factored in a slightly unnatural way, because it reads like they've structured the code to match the tests, rather than written tests to test aspects of the code.Maybe I should just be a hermit-programmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a principle called "the principle of maximum inconvenience".This principle tells you that whatever you should be doing right now, is the most inconvenient possible path at this time.It serves as a guide to help orient me in life especially when I'm at a crossroads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646601</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rationale behind designing the TigerBeetle documentation from the ground up. It emphasizes the importance of creating a user-friendly and accessible resource that enhances the overall experience for developers interacting with the software. The author outlines the challenges faced with existing documentation systems and highlights the new features and design choices that aim to improve clarity, efficiency, and usability, ultimately catering to a diverse audience of users with varying technical backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is a fun thing for TigerBeetle to do, but I'm pretty skeptical that this was a good engineering decision.And it's fine to make non-optimal engineering decisions for fun, but the top reason in the article should be, "Because we thought it would be fun to code a docs site from scratch."This post reminds me a lot of an article I read on HN about a year ago and can't find now, but the author was explaining how so many organizations end up investing humongous amounts of effort rolling their own databases from scratch because none of the off-the-shelf solutions meet all their requirements. But in most of these cases, it's because some of the "requirements" were actually "nice-to-haves" and they could have gotten by fine with an off-the-shelf database, but they talked themselves into building one from scratch.A lot of the justifications here feel pretty weak:- Didn't want to use a complicated React app? Use Hugo or Pelican or Eleventy.- Wanted nice reading experience? Replace the default CSS in any SSG.- Want a nice search experience? Theirs looks good, but is probably also achievable in off-the-shelf SSGs and is probably not worth rolling their own docs site from scratch.&gt;We employed a Content Security Policy to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) as defense-in-depth, in case a seemingly friendly PR contains some innocent looking MathML. This MathML could contain obfuscated code that would run in the user’s browser. CSP prevents any unwanted inline scripts from running and keeps our users safer.This was the silliest reason of all. Who's XSS'ing a docs site through obfuscated markup contributions? That sounds pretty difficult to achieve in the first place, and then what's the reward for achieving XSS on TigerBeetle's docs site? There's no valuable data there. At worst, you'd mine tiny amounts of crypto in a serviceworker. But also, you can mitigate this risk in lots of ways that don't involve rolling your own docs site.Edit: They don't seem to actually be using CSP at all: https://gist.github.com/mtlynch/92c991cfe48652feee491d4f4652...Edit2: Nevermind, they actually do but in HTML. Hat tip to  
pfg_.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN readers, you can say what you want, but you gotta admit: TigerBeetle’s got style. And they do things differently and nicely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This is the place where people usually reach out for heavy artillery of [..] Nix, which solves the problem of “works on my machine” by turning your machine into mine!This is ironic, because what they've done is just hand-roll their own mini Nix.&gt; Violation of our zero dependency principle: as Docusaurus is based on NodeJS, it added a lot of dependencies to our code base. We have a check that no large files are committed to git, and package-lock.json failed this check.What is the purpose behind the second sentence? Or rather which?- We want all source to be byte-sized and human-understandable- We don't like how git/other tools work with large files?If the latter, fine, but if it former, then I think you're violating the spirit, if not letter, by pinning a pre-built static binary of pandoc. The machine code is definitely not inspectable, and the build-time inputs closure (back to source files) is still massive, involving Lua and many bootstrapped GHCs for Haskell!What makes Nix "heavy weight" is not some "take over your whole system" approach (on Linux, you can skip the installer and just run the Nix binary), but because tries to "cheat" with prebuilt binaries as little as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43610566</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Bazel, a build and test tool developed by Google, focusing on its evolution and future directions. It highlights Bazel's efficiency in handling large codebases, its support for multiple languages, and its scalability for modern software development. The piece emphasizes the community's role in contributing to Bazel's development and how it is adapting to meet the demands of next-generation software engineering practices. Additionally, it covers upcoming features and improvements aimed at enhancing user experience and performance within the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A big problem with Bazel not mentioned here is the complexity. It's just really hard for many people to grasp, and adopting Bazel at the two places I worked was a ~10 person-year effort for the rollout with ongoing maintenance after. That's a lot of effort!IMO Bazel has a lot of good ideas to it: hierarchical graph-based builds, pure hermetic build steps, and so on. Especially at the time, these were novel ideas. But in Bazel they are buried behind a sea of other concepts that may not be so critical: `query` vs `aquery` vs `cquery`, action-graph vs configured-action-graph vs target-graph, providers vs outputs,  macro vs rule-impl, etc. Some of these are necessary for ultra-large-scale builds, some are compromises due to legacy, but for the vast majority of non-Google-scale companies there may be a better way.I'm hoping the next generation of build tools can simplify things enough that you don't need a person-decade of engineering work to adopt it. My own OSS project Mill (https://mill-build.org/) is one attempt in that direction, by re-using ideas from functional and object-oriented programming  that people are already familiar with to make build graphs easier to describe and work with. Maybe a new tool won't be able to support million-file monorepos with 10,000 active contributors, but I think for the vast majority of developers and teams that's not a problem at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the dismissal of buck2 pretty shallow. Most of the world is not already heavily invested to bazel, so compatibility is imho overstated; I don't see it being that far-fetched for something like buck2 to leapfrog bazel. That being said, buck2 definitely would need some love from outside meta to really be viable competitor, right now it still feels like half-complete code drop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article, that gets the critique exactly right. The most frustrating part of Bazel is how shoddy the workmanship is. For example, Bazel throws away your analysis cache when you change flags that have nothing to do with what's being built or how, like flags that change what tests are run.If course the biggest issue is that tiny operations take more time than necessary. For example, at $PreviousJob we wrote custom CLI tools and put them in our monorepo, but since you need Bazel to run them, running a basic tool took 9-12 seconds. So this revelation from the article was totally unsurprising:&gt; This rewrite was carefully crafted to optimize memory layouts, avoiding unnecessary pointer chasing (which was impossible to avoid in Java). The results of this experiment proved that Blaze could be made to analyze large portions of Google’s build graph in just a fraction of the time, without any sort of analysis caching or significant startup penalties.Yeah, with attentive engineering it's not surprising that you can get massive speedups.Finally, Bazel is ok at building multiple languages, but awful at getting them to depend on each other. I don't know what's going on here, but whatever magic makes it possible for any language to depend on C and C++ was not extended to other possible dependencies. So now you get to fight or rewrite all the rules, which is another bag of worms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601356</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;EQ Bench provides an extensive overview of creative writing techniques and resources, particularly focusing on long-form writing. It covers essential elements such as narrative structure, character development, theme exploration, and style. Additionally, the site offers various tools and prompts to facilitate the creative writing process, helping authors enhance their skills and generate compelling content. The aim is to support writers at all levels in producing engaging and well-crafted long-form narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longform creative writing is possibly the least valid or interesting use case for LLMs.Why should I be bothered to read what nobody could be bothered to write?The point of writing is communication and creative writing is specifically about the human experience… something a LLM can mimic but never speak to authoritatively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of these benchmarks have gotten out of hand, which is highly suggestive. Benchmarks exist as an indicator of quality and proliferate when other indicators of quality fail. Their very prominence implies that observers are having a difficult time assessing LLM performance in context, which hints at a limited utility or more precisely a non-closed feedback loop at the level of utility. (You know a burger tastes really good when you eat it, no benchmarks required.)Perhaps LLM development really does exist at this rarefied abstract level whereby the development team cannot be immersed in application context, but I doubt that notion. More likely the performance observed in context is either so dispiriting or difficult (or nonexistent) that teams return again and again to the more generously validating benchmarks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve noticed the same contrast - technical writing from LLMs often needs trimming for clarity, but creative writing can lean too far into either bland or overly flowery language.Most LLM benchmarks lean heavily on fluency, but things like internal logic, tone consistency, and narrative pacing are harder to quantify. I think using a second model to extract logical or structural assertions could be a smart direction. It’s not perfect, but it shifts focus from just “how it sounds” to “does it actually make sense over time.” Creative writing benchmarks still feel very early-stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43641381</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To some extent the "mystery" (and temporary free-as-in-beer-ness) of this model might be getting to me, but I think it's pretty interesting.  Given the token throughput (250B this week) it's obvious there's a pretty major player behind the model, but why is it stealthed? Maybe there's something about the architecture or training that would put people off if it was public right off the bat? Maybe they're purely collecting usage/acceptance data and want unbiased users?On the Aider Polyglot leaderboard it's ~middle of the leading pack, comparable to DeepSeek V3 and 3.5 Sonnet.  I ran NoLi(teral)Ma(tching), an unsaturated long-context benchmark, on it and was impressed though:  = Model =========== Base Score = 8K Context = 16K Context =
  Quasar Alpha:       &gt;=97.8%      89.2%        85.1%
  GPT-4o:             99.3%        89.2%        81.6%
  Llama 3.3 70B:      97.3%        72.1%        59.5%
  Gemini 1.5 Pro:     92.6%        63.9%        55.5%
  Claude 3.5 Sonnet:  87.6%        61.7%        45.7%
  Gemini 1.5 Flash:   84.7%        44.4%        35.5%
  GPT-4o mini:        84.9%        32.6%        20.6%
  Llama 3.1 8B:       76.7%        31.9%        22.6%

It also performs well - slightly better than GPT-o1 - on the "hard" subset at 16K context with 62.8%.  Latency is quite good as well.More details: https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ju1czn/quasar_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oof, it started strong and then went with the "who created you" which shows no understanding of how LLMs work. (They don't know a thing about themselves, they will either regurgitate their prompt or hallucinate something, usually that they are ChatGPT since that is the most likely LLM to appear in training data.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most fun way I’ve seen users explore its origin is to give it a single period (”.”) as your first query. Only OpenAI answers in this way with a smiley at the end, and it’s probably a more certain way to check it than asking about its arch, because many will incorrectly answer OpenAI and GPT-4 due to (?) tainted training data as ChatGPT has been so much in the news and became a de facto LLM early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640166</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643197"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The earliest home computers had tiny amounts of memory:  my TRS-80 Color Computer started out with 4K of RAM and BASIC in ROM although within a few years I had it filled out with 64K of RAM.  There weren't a lot of languages that would fit in 4K,  but they included BASIC, FORTH and assembler (like the actual assembler.) [1]My FORTH experience with that was writing a subroutine-threaded FORTH for the 6809 under the OS-9 operating system in about 3000 lines of assembler.  I wrote to the Forth Interest Group and they sent me a card which had a list of standard words in FIG FORTH,  mine complied with that except that I used the Unix-like system calls from OS-9 for file I/O instead of the block scheme most FORTHs used.[1] The popular 6502 (Apple ][, Atari 400/800, C-64, ...) was particularly weak in support for compiled languages because it had few registers and fewer addressing modes but it was easy to write a FORTH for too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Jupiter Ace was before my time, but I found the user manual to be a very well written Forth tutorial: https://archive.org/details/Jupiter_Ace_Users_Manual_1982_Ju...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had one of the early Jupiter Aces - the
circuit board said something like v1.00 - and it had some added
soldered wires on the board, correcting some errors, but it worked
well enough.  Forth was definitely what attracted me to it - I was frustrated with Basic on my Sinclair XZ81, and Forth seemed like a big step forward.  And I think it was.I was 14 or 15 at the time. The first summer I wrote a whole load of games, mostly in Forth, but
sometimes Forth just wasn't fast enough. I got a copy of "Mastering
Machine Code on Your ZX81", and learned Z80 machine code. If there was
an assembler available, I didn't have it, so this was all
hand-assembled. Getting jumps right was a total pain, as was
debugging. Generally, it either worked first time, or you started from
scratch again. Usually I got there in the end.I sold those games through a ad in "Your Computer" magazine, and
earned back the price of the computer several times. But recording and
shipping tapes one at a time got tedious really fast, so I didn't take
that any further.My Ace got modified quite a bit over the next couple of years. An extra
16KB RAM pack was an early addition, taking it to a whopping 19KB.
Because Forth was so compact, I never filled that up.My mother worked for Chubb cash dispensers (ATMs for Americans) at the time, and at some
point they scrapped a lot of equipment.  She tipped me off, and we
went round there one evening and liberated lots of cash dispenser
pieces from a skip.  Amongst these were several numeric keypads with
lovely mechanical keys.  I dismantled several keypads to take out all
the individual keys and made a proper keyboard to replace the original
dead rubber monstrosity.At school, I was taking O-level Technology, and you had to do a final
year project.  I'd seen articles in "Your Computer" about competitions
where a micro-mouse robot would have to find its way through a maze.
That seemed like a cool idea to me, so I decided to make one, despite
not really having much idea how.  I hadn't done any digital
electronics at that time, but my friend Johnny Tombs (who later went
on to be a Professor of Electronic Engineering) had decided to make a
parallel I/O port for his ZX Spectrum using TTL logic for his Technology project.  I'm not
sure where Johnny learned about digital electronics, but he knew what
he was doing, and designed a nice elegant circuit board and etched it
at home.  The Ace had the same Z80A CPU as the Spectrum, so I figured his
design could be adapted.  After a lot of pleading, he gave my his
design and spent some time explaining to me how it worked and loaned
me his copy of Watford Electronics catalog.  A couple of weeks later
all the components arrived, and I spent a busy few days soldering up
my modified I/O port on veroboard.  Compared to Johnny's professional
looking version, mine looked like a mess of wires and chips, but it
worked!So then when it wasn't playing games, my Ace rode about on the top of
a fairly flaky micromouse, made in the school metalwork shop out of
aluminium sheet, some lego motors, and some light sensors to detect
maze walls, exploring mazes. It didn't win any prizes but it did get
me an A in O-level Technology.My school was throwing out an old teletype, so I scavenged that. Then
I modified the parallel I/O port to output +/- 12V on one pin, and
wrote software to bit-bang RS232 at 110 baud. Back before the
Internet, just finding the specs for RS232 was not so simple - our
local library was a bit limited in that way - but I got there in the
end. A lot of guesswork and trial and error. I don't think anyone made
a printer for the Ace, so I may have had the only one. Being able to
print code listings really helped, even though the teleprinter only printed capital letters.Somewhere over the years, with my parents moving house multiple times,
the Ace disappeared. Many years later, I found one on Ebay, and still
have it. But somehow I never fell back in love with it - it just
wasn't as good as I remembered my rather non-stock one being at
that formative time in my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643197</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea of having specific business hours for a website, suggesting that this concept can enhance user engagement and improve customer service. It explores the potential benefits of scheduling website "open" and "closed" times, such as creating urgency for users to visit during business hours, allowing for focused website maintenance, and fostering a more personalized user experience. The author encourages businesses to consider the impact of a structured online presence and invites them to evaluate how it could be applied to their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

At first I thought it was a joke as the message displays something like, "we want to respect a work life balance and therefore only offer online services from X to Y." But for real, you can't access the online services during US based business hours.It is wrong in so many ways. First of all the site is determining when the appropriate business hours are for its users, not taking into consideration moonlighters or other night owls. And second, it's a service for travel agents!! who are supposedly traveling to other time zones.I get it if the people behind a service need to set limits on when they are expected to handle requests, but that doesn't mean the service shouldn't be available all the time. Good messaging and setting expectations for when requests will be handled are a much better solution in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently had this idea about email servers. In addition to configuring my IMAP clients to normally fetch mail manually or more infrequently, I set up one mail server that “closes” from 7 p.m. till 7 a.m. my time.During that time, it returns a temporary error `450 4.3.2 We're sorry! The mail room is closed from 7 p.m. till 7 a.m. [Time Zone]. Email servers automatically retry, so your mail should be delivered in a few hours.` Depending on their mail provider and the time of evening, some will never see an error, while others will eventually receive the standard “Delayed Mail: no need to retry” message in their own inboxes.I see it as accomplishing three things: first, it tests email servers to see if they properly handle temporary delivery errors by retrying; second, it prevents me from checking my email after hours, or rather, leaves me overnight with only the email I got during the day, perhaps encouraging better habits; and third, it could provide an opportunity for others to consider assumptions about always-on digital services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant given a lot of the discussion here: Why some DVLA services don't work at nighthttps://dafyddvaughan.uk/blog/2025/why-some-dvla-digital-ser...(they were frontends to old systems that were based on assumptions of when data would be submitted)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647598</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the key differences between municipal fire trucks and airport fire trucks. Municipal fire trucks are designed for general firefighting purposes in urban settings and typically include a variety of equipment for various emergencies. In contrast, airport fire trucks are specialized vehicles equipped to handle aviation-related incidents, featuring unique firefighting capabilities, such as foam delivery systems and enhanced maneuverability to access airport runways. The article highlights the significance of these differences in ensuring effective firefighting operations in their respective environments.&lt;/p&gt;

They're shorter than municipal or airport trucks, for dirt roads with tight turns.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They released the data for this report as a bunch of CSV files in a Google Drive, so I converted those into a SQLite database for exploration with Datasette Lite: https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://static.simonwillison....Here's the most interesting table, illustrating examples of bias in different models https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://static.simonwillison....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I'm certain of is that the standard of living will increase. Because we can do more effective work in the same time. This means more output and things will become cheaper. What I'm not sure of, is where this effect will show in the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always see these reports about how much better AI is than humans now, but I can't even get it to help me with pretty mundane problem solving. Yesterday I gave Claude a file with a few hundred lines of code, what the input should be, and told it where the problem was. I tried until I ran out of credits and it still could not work backwards to tell me where things were going wrong. In the end I just did it myself and it turned out to be a pretty obvious problem.The strange part with these LLMs is that they get weirdly hung up on things. I try to direct them away from a certain type of output and somehow they keep going back to it. It's like the same problem I have with Google where if I try to modify my search to be more specific, it just ignores what it doesn't like about my query and gives me the same output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644662</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been having an internal debate with myself about whether or not to leave a comment, because I’m struggling to find anything positive to say. I love weekend projects and don't ever want to discourage people from doing them.But the other side of that debate in my head comes from the way I feel about this idea relative to blogging. I read blogs because I want to hear directly from another human. I also care about the subject matter they’re writing about, but part of the reason I care is because it’s a slice of someone’s perspective. Their life experiences. How a particular subject relates to them personally. How they solved a particular problem. Even when a blog post is purely technical with no personal narrative, it usually provides a snapshot of some aspect of some other human’s life, and the way they structure the words they wrote is a reflection of how their brain works.I also enjoy seeing the progression of thought over time from authors. They’ll write about something and later realize some nuance was wrong, and they’ll write about their updated understanding.I worry that the more disconnected authors become from their writing, the less aware they’ll be of the potential impact of their words, and those “aha! that thing I wrote 6 months ago was crap for xyz reason” moments are less likely to happen.To me, AI-assisted blogging just fundamentally devalues the content. As a reader, I can’t know if what I’m reading is real to the author, or a flourish/detail fed to them by an LLM that they liked. Lately I’ve encountered an increasing number of posts that have those telltale (or obvious) signs, and I immediately stop reading. I’m no longer interested.If I wanted LLM output about a given subject, I’d go to ChatGPT myself.I think there’s a place for LLMs and some real value to be gained. But when it comes to blogging (and many types of writing), I think it’s a net negative to society.I’d like to see a standard emerge where blogs can label themselves “No AI”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the 2025 edition of "I have to build a custom static site generator" instead of writing blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This indicates to me that you treat blogging as an obligation rather than a way to share your ideas. I guess if you read enough AI blog spam, blogging itself just feels like a status game of what you've written about, divorced from quality of content? If you're padding out your own ideas with AI filler, why not just make your style more shortform and save your reader's time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616356</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The Plug Socket Museum's British section showcases the historical evolution of electrical plugs and sockets used in the United Kingdom. It provides detailed information about various designs and standards over the years, highlighting significant developments in electrical safety and functionality. The museum features images and descriptions of different plug types, including the iconic BS 1363, and offers insights into their impact on electrical appliances and consumer safety. Overall, it serves as an educational resource for understanding the technological advancements and regulations related to electrical connectors in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is genuinely the best plug ever and no one can convince me otherwise.I've toured continental Europe (France, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Italy), the US, India, and ANZ, and all of their plugs are downgrades in comparison to the icon of engineering that is Type G/BS1363. The former somehow all tend to end up with loose contact, wiggling and sparking, degraded power/current, or a cable that sticks out perpendicular to the wall, or some other annoyance. People argue for the Schuko but it is as large as, if not larger than BS1363 plugs. The earthing setup is odd.The BS1363 is so massive that it shrugs off power loads of multiple kilowatts—British kettles and toaster ovens run at up to 3 kW or more. One could possibly even charge their EV with BS1363 without needing any automotive cable standard[1].The BS1363 has a satisfying 'thonk' that no other plug has. It feels like you're powering up some futuristic space craft, not your vacuum cleaner.[1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricVehiclesUK/comments/1gta12f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have the same plugs in Singapore.Apple made a very elegant USB charger with foldable pins. It’s like a fidget spinner, impossible to stop playing with.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RxWEycdj4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree with comments below, am observing that the British (commonwealth etc) plug standard is a good common denominator (and a perfect calthrop.  grin!).Living in North America where the 110 V is standard...the GBR plug/socket is a lovely standard, my brother-in-law gifted us a UK power bar for travel a few years ago, worked great.  [[1]].  Since then, it's become common that wallwarts handle 100-240, so recently I just use physical adapters, and if need be wallwarts with multiple charging ports and/or feed-through mains sockets.[[1]] use whatever physical adapter to power it -- we know that it's ok for 240 V.  Then use whatever adapters to charge.  I did have a bagful of physical adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639421</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggests that Saturn's moon Titan may be capable of supporting life, though only in minimal quantities. The research indicates that Titan has the necessary conditions for chemical reactions that could lead to biological processes, but the potential for abundant life forms is limited due to the harsh environment. Scientists emphasize the significance of understanding Titan's unique atmosphere and chemistry, which could provide insights into the possibilities of life beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

"Such a tiny biosphere would average less than one cell per liter of water over Titan's entire vast ocean."Assuming for a moment that some life does exist in the subsurface ocean, I imagine it would be most likely that you would then expect to find very, very rare, but highly concentrated pockets of life?Unfortunately I couldn't read the linked study because I was stuck in an endless CAPTCHA loop of trying to find an image of a refrigerator among a varying set of only helicopters, ships, and avocados. I feel absurd just writing that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope there will be sirens... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are bolide impact events the only possible mechanism for communication between ice crust and subsurface ocean?

&lt;p&gt;The Messier Marathon is an astronomical challenge that involves observing all 110 objects listed in the Messier catalog in a single night. Typically held during a specific time in spring when the conditions are optimal for observing, participants plan their viewing strategy to maximize the number of objects seen as they rise in the sky. The event requires careful timing and knowledge of celestial navigation, as well as suitable equipment for stargazing. The Marathon not only serves as a test of observational skills but also promotes interest in astronomy and encourages teamwork among participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article "But What If I Really Want a Faster Horse" explores the common misconception that customers know exactly what they want and how that can limit innovation. Using the analogy of Henry Ford's famous quote about faster horses, it emphasizes that while people may express desires for specific features, they often do not envision the groundbreaking solutions that meet their deeper needs. The piece advocates for understanding customer problems rather than simply delivering requested solutions, highlighting the importance of creative thinking in product development and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For any given thing or category of thing, a tiny minority of the human population will be enthusiasts of that thing, but those enthusiasts will have an outsize effect in determining everyone else's taste for that thing. For example, very few people have any real interest in driving a car at 200 MPH, but Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches are widely understood as desirable cars, because the people who are into cars like those marques.If you're designing a consumer-oriented web service like Netflix or Spotify or Instagram, you will probably add in some user analytics service, and use the insights from that analysis to inform future development. However, that analysis will aggregate its results over all your users, and won't pick out the enthusiasts, who will shape discourse and public opinion about your service. Consequently, your results will be dominated by people who don't really have an opinion, and just take whatever they're given.Think about web browsers. The first popular browser was Netscape Navigator; then, Internet Explorer came onto the scene. Mozilla Firefox clawed back a fair chunk of market share, and then Google Chrome came along and ate everyone's lunch. In all of these changes, most of the userbase didn't really care what browser they were using: the change was driven by enthusiasts recommending the latest and greatest to their less-technically-inclined friends and family.So if you develop your product by following your analytics, you'll inevitably converge on something that just shoves content into the faces of an indiscriminating userbase, because that's what the median user of any given service wants. (This isn't to say that most people are tasteless blobs; I think everyone is a connoisseur of something, it's just that for any given individual, that something probably isn't your product.) But who knows - maybe that really is the most profitable way to run a tech business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a fundamental reality that shapes both Netflix and Spotify's trajectory: content licensing. 2012 Netflix had access to vastly more of everyone else's library, so it was closer to an indexed search of what was available that one could watch and then getting that video onto your screen. Over time, other companies understood that they were underpricing their content and Netflix was reaping the benefits. Once external forces adjusted, the TV/film bidding wars began. Today, netflix doesn't have nearly as much content as they used to have.That risk (losing all content and facing extinction) is what pushed Netflix in the direction of being a content-producer, rather than a content aggregator. I agree with everyone's points on the influence of the median user in diluting the quality of the content Netflix produces, but that's not the only forced that pushed us here. Spotify faced a similar crossroads and decided to broaden beyond music once they started losing bidding wars for licensing.Being a faster horse wasn't an option available to either Netflix or Spotify; there is no path for a 'better 2012 version of netflix or spotify' in 2025. They each had to change species or die, and they chose to keep living.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TikTok-ification of advertising supported platforms is terrible, but makes sense to me.  LinkedIn pivoted from making money on subscriptions and fees for job postings to ads, which mean the leading drivers are 'engagement' e.g. time you spend doom scrolling on their platform.  This will end in disaster for the platform as a place to find jobs or employees.Netflix I understand much less.  They make money from subscriptions. If you perceive having a fantastic experience on the site by just going there, finding something you enjoy watching, and leaving... they win.  Why they would foster a doom-scrolling experience I really can't really explain, other than imagining some dark pattern like they have to pay per view and want you to watch C grade movies?  More time spent looking for something to watch means less time streaming?I don't get it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652723</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a leak that reveals Israeli censorship practices involving Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It highlights how the Israeli government allegedly influenced Meta's content moderation policies to suppress Palestinian narratives and posts critical of Israel. The leak raises concerns about the impact of state-sponsored censorship on freedom of expression and the role of social media companies in moderating content under governmental pressure. The piece emphasizes the need for transparency in the policies governing online speech and the implications for both users and the broader discourse on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

These companies are enticed to 'suck up' to the government because at the end they are business, they need to be in good term with ruling class.you end up with most media complying with the official story pushed by government and friends, and most people believing that because no one has the time to fact check everything.One could argue that the difference with russia is that someone can actually look for real information, but even in russia people have access to vpn to bypass the censorship.Another difference would be that you are allowed to express your opinion, whereas in russia you would be put to jail, that's true but only in a very limited way. Since everyone goes on mainstream media and they enforce the government narrative, you can't speak there. you are merely allowed to speak out in your little corner out of reach to anyone, and even then since most people believe the government propaganda, your arguments won't be heard at all.The more i think about it, the less difference i see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So when the government pointed to the disproportionate support for Palestine on TikTok vs Instagram, it was actually because Instagram was suppressing it. It is ironic.https://x.com/hawleymo/status/1717505662601609401&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655603</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;I tried to explain how review workflows work in a PR-based setup, and gave concrete suggestions for how we could improve the process. But they didn’t want to try it. That might sound like a small thing, but at that stage, all I wanted was a smooth and efficient collaboration process. The easier it was for me to track changes, the better.I'm surprised the copy editor was more comfortable using git than using a web-based review tool to leave comments, especially given that she was reviewing a Go book and didn't seem to know what Go was.How does that even happen? It seems bizarre that Manning had this copy editor at all.I recently had a negative experience with Manning. I sent them an email saying that I'm in the process of writing a book, and I'm self-publishing it, but I was curious about the possibility of applying to Manning for a second edition. I asked whether they accept second editions after a self-published first edition and what document formats they accept.I got back a form letter telling me that they'd rejected my proposal. When I followed up and said I didn't send a proposal but was asking preliminary questions, they told me that they understood I hadn't sent a proposal, but they were going off of the table of contents on my book's website. I guess they decided to pre-emptively reject me?They also only said Google Docs as a document format, but based on this blog post, clearly they accept AsciiDoc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since you're in here, if I can recommend: sync.Pool with non-fixed-size objects is a source of many problems.  https://wundergraph.com/blog/golang-sync-pool as a decent overview, and https://github.com/yarpc/yarpc-go/issues/2355 has been my recent plague.If you browse around Go's stdlib use of sync.Pool, you'll see a variety of tiered pools with fixed sizes, and many drop anything over a large enough size (sometimes gigantic!  as much as 16KB!): https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.24.0:src/...It's a pretty well-established gotcha, sadly, and https://github.com/teivah/100-go-mistakes/blob/master/src/12... falls right into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of copy editing you raise: I wrote a book in DocBook for Manning in 2010. DocBook is XML, so I structured it with opening / end tags on their own line, content in the middle. As you would with a HTML document.After copy editing multiple chapters, they sent it back to me with all the content on a single line. I was so incredibly upset that they ditched all my painstaking format that I almost abandoned the project there + then.It sounds like from your experience that it has barely changed. I ended up moving to self-publishing so I have a greater control over the whole process. I wrote it up long-form here: https://ryanbigg.com/2015/08/my-self-publishing-success-stor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647880</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some fun historical context behind the outline algorithm and why it didn't catch on: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25003In short, the W3C adopted it because they thought it was a good idea, while browsers and screen readers both refused to adopt it for various reasons like ambiguity with existing web content or concerns about screen readers having to implement and maintain their own independent outline algorithm implementations. 8 years and an entire standards organization after the thread above, the WHATWG finally dropped it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related to this, does anyone know why &lt;h5&gt; and &lt;h6&gt; are smaller than &lt;p&gt; by default? I asked this on Stackexchange years ago and didn’t really get to the bottom of it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55696808/why-do-h5-and-h....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stuff like "Alongside the changes in browser styles, page auditing tools like Lighthouse now flag cases of &lt;h1&gt;s without defined font-size as bad practice." make me pretty certain this is the wrong change to make.HTML is about semantic markup, not visual markup. Features like CSS were introduced because people started trying to use the semantic markup to achieve specific visual results, and so CSS was the solution to allow HTML to continue to be semantic markup and CSS to optionally format it if people wanted specific non-default things.As a reader, I don't want page authors to start hard coding sizes into these elements, because then they'll be more likely to choose non-default values to make their page stand out a bit more.Additionally, the current behaviour (which I'd never particularly considered before) sounds entirely reasonable - if I take some existing markup and blockquote it in some container, I'd expect the headings to shrink as they're now all sub-elements of some other section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649853</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The main content of the website is a humorous and satirical exploration of the technical specifications and attributes of a fictional product called the "Muppet Labs Official Muppet Performance Enhancer." It outlines exaggerated features and whimsical functionalities, such as enhanced creativity and an increase in silliness, while also poking fun at typical marketing language and product reviews. The tone is light-hearted, showcasing the playful spirit associated with Muppet Labs and its creations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a long essay, and here is my pitch as to why you should read the whole thing if you have any interest in subjects like C programming, binary formats, kernel modules, or assembler.Breadbox, the author, wants to make smaller binary executables. He explains about ELF binaries, a.out binaries, old MSDOS .COM binaries, and how the later had no metadata, and could be very small. He then explains how you can dynamically load code that deals with new executable binary formats into the Linux kernel, and how this process works. He walks through some sample C for building a "Hello World" kernel module. He then walks you through ~1 page of code for a kernel module that registers a new binary format, sets up some callbacks, and if conditions are right, will vm_mmap() the code into memory and call start_thread() on it.Yay, it works! He has a tiny binary. This is where most articles would end, but Breadbox goes deeper. What if you want a stack and a heap? What if you want to access argc, argv, and envp? What if you want to append code at the end that automatically calls the exit syscall? All these details are covered, and I think it's glorious.While this all may seem like pretty dry stuff, there is humor sprinkled throughout, which makes it more fun to read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is fantastic.And it pairs well with another article on the front page. [0]Which I bring up because they disagree on a particular point. And that is how a script without a shebang gets run as a script.&gt; This is done by registering a set of callback functions, and these callbacks get invoked when the kernel is asked to execute a binary file. The kernel invokes the callbacks on this list, and the first one that claims to recognize the file takes responsibility for getting it properly loaded into memory. If nobody on the list accepts it, then as a last resort the kernel will attempt to treat it as a shell script without a shebang line. And if that doesn't fly, then you'll get that "Exec format error" message described above.But the article I linked to says the shell actually handles it. And based off of its research (terribly reproduced below), I'm inclined to believe it.    echo echo Hello world &gt; test.sh
    chmod +x test.sh
    strace ./test.sh
    strace sh -c ./test.sh

You'll see the first one errors with `ENOEXEC`, but the second one does not. Also, in my head, I don't know how the kernel would know what shell to choose, or that it should even expect to have access to a shell.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646698&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can do better than 2 bytes. Use the same epilogue, but store a copy of the "binary" just before the stack pointer and offset the instruction pointer from the start of the binary by 1 byte. If you use the binary consisting of literally a one-byte value, 0x2A (i.e. 42), then your first instruction will be the first instruction of the epilogue which will pop the "binary" into RDI setting RDI to 42. There are maybe some details in the alignment, padding, and instruction choice in the loader to make that work "generically", but that strategy should work and give you a 1-byte solution.edit: Actually, just define your binary format so that the first byte is copied to the stack and all subsequent bytes are copied to text with the epilogue appended to it.edit: You could also define it so that the first byte is copied into the first argument register/RDI if you want to shrink loaded RAM usage to just 4 bytes of code and 1 byte of data.This is of course assuming it is a "generic" binary format that is not literally just encoding the contents of the tiny program. Otherwise you could do 0 bytes and just have the loader pre-fill RAX with 60 and RDI with 42 and insert a one instruction epilogue consisting of syscall. You could technically still call that a "generic" binary format since any actual binary you attempt to load will just blow away those pre-filled GPR values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647294</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A fintech founder has been charged with fraud after an AI shopping app, which was promoted as being powered by advanced artificial intelligence, was revealed to be operated by human workers in the Philippines. This deceptive practice drew significant attention, leading to legal action against the founder for misleading investors and customers about the app's actual capabilities. The case highlights ongoing concerns regarding transparency and ethics in the rapidly evolving fintech and AI sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of this article from two years ago [0] and my HN comment on it. Yet another AI startup on the general trajectory of:1) Someone runs into an interesting problem that can potentially be solved with ML/AI. They try to solve it for themselves.2) "Hey! The model is kind of working. It's useful enough that I bet other people would pay for it."3) They launch a paid API, SaaS startup, etc. and get a few paying customers.4) Turns out their ML/AI method doesn't generalize so well. Reputation is everything at this level, so they hire some human workers to catch and fix the edge cases that end up badly. They tell themselves that they can also use it to train and improve the model.5) Uh-oh, the model is underperforming, and the human worker pipeline is now some significant part of the full workflow.6) Then someone writes an article about them using cheap human labor.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37405450&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been flagged as a potential shoplifter by the self-checkout at the grocery store based on some video analysis of CCTV footage of my hand motions. (It was wrong, of course.) After leaving the store I wondered if it really was software analysis or just some guy in India or the Philippines watching a live feed of me scanning bananas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering why there wasn't a DOJ concern when Amazon Go did the same thing:&gt; Amazon Go: Early on, Amazon was clear that it was testing “Just Walk Out” tech — and it was known (at least in tech circles) that they had humans reviewing edge cases through video feeds. Some even joked about the “humans behind the AI.”
&gt; Their core claim was that eventually the tech would get better, and the human backup was mostly for training data and quality assurance.
&gt; They didn’t say, “this is 100% AI with zero human help right now.”&gt; Nate: Claimed it was already fully automated.
&gt; Their CEO explicitly said the AI was doing all the work — “without human intervention” — and only used contractors for rare edge cases.
&gt; According to the DOJ, the truth was: humans were doing everything, and AI was just a branding tool.
&gt; Investors were told it was a software platform, when it was really a BPO in disguise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648950</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the manufacturing process of the Liberty Phone, a high-end, Made-in-the-USA smartphone priced at $2,000. It details the various stages of production, emphasizing the use of domestic materials and labor while showcasing the company's commitment to quality and sustainability. The piece highlights the challenges of sourcing components and labor domestically, contrasting this approach with the common practice of overseas manufacturing. Additionally, it underscores the importance of innovation and local economic impact in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that they admitted that their cost to produce the phone in China is $550 and they sell it for $799, while the cost to produce the phone in the US is $650 and they sell it for $2000. That's a 45% markup on one and 207% markup on the other.Taking just those figures in mind, they shouldn't be at all worried about tariffs - anything more than an 18% tariff, it's cheaper for them to build in the US than China for US customers. Honestly, that's much lower than I expected, especially considering they're even more restrictive in their component sourcing than most companies would need to be because they're catering to a security-focused group.I guess the real issue is that they don't have any more production capacity in the US, rather than it just being a cost issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The important quote: "If the tariff from China is 100%, and you know it is going to be 100 % for the next 10 years, you will make a different business decision than if it is, ‘Might be 100%, not sure what's going to be in three months, what's it going to be in a year from now, and what's it going to be in three years from now.’ That uncertainty does not create stable markets. It does not create very accurate business decisions."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As one of the “skilled electronics engineers” in the US you could count on US soil (whatever that means) I can tell you this article reads very strangely to a EE.“we were able to take all those designs and spin up our own SMT, it's called Surface Mount Technology”“run that through our surface mount technology by our line operators”“meaning the printed circuit board or PCBA assembly”So, he’s definitely not an EE.  No EE talks like this when they are trying to explain the nuts and bolts to a lay person.  Either that or the editor took liberties they shouldn’t have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646920</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that personal strengths can also lead to weaknesses, suggesting that traits often perceived as positive can have negative consequences when taken to extremes. It emphasizes the importance of self-awareness in recognizing how these strengths may hinder growth or lead to pitfalls in various aspects of life, including work and relationships. By understanding the dual nature of strengths, individuals can work towards balancing them to avoid potential downsides and strive for personal and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652024"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, and more importantly...Strengths are weaknesses because they create a bias to use the strength rather than developing a weak alternate, and you only get better at what you do - creating a virtuous cycle that can quickly turn vicious.This will happen whenever growth is mediated mainly by feedback loops.  (Think hard about that!)The solution is instead to have a model of what you're trying to grow, whether it's a company or a positive presence in the world, and be willing to sacrifice to make that happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, people aren't so static as to have dualities. They don't fit so neatly into little descriptors.What is a strength? Something you are inherently talented at? A skill you have plenty of experience with? A subject you have a lot of knowledge of? What you are motivated by?What is a weakness?I see that most people are rather adaptable to context. When you're working at a startup building an app make AI complete your Uber orders for you, there's no reason to be focused on making sure the system is scalable to a million requests per second. Most people tend to understand that. They may have a lot of experience building highly scalable backend systems, they may want to build another system like that again because it pleases them to do so. But most people will see the forest for the trees and focus on getting the project out the door in the fastest way possible because they probably won't have a million customers for a long time... if at all.I tend to look for what people value when building a team. You'll need to match the set-intersection of the teams' values with the goals of the business. People are motivated to work on thing they value. We can tolerate working on things we don't but try to avoid doing that for too long. So if the business needs a highly reliable system because failures can lose their customers millions of dollars a minute for downtime then you'll want to stock your team with developers that value those things the company cares about.What you're good at today can change tomorrow. You can be better at it. It's a skill, it's knowledge, it's something you can acquire: it's not an attribute or trait of you as a person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would conceptualize it rather differently. Let say you have two daemons inside, Fast Coder and Detail Scrutinizer. It is about checking how much power every one of them is given on two separate scales (every each of them working in their dominion). If you switch on only one and neglect the other, you can get into trouble (or not, depending on the circumstances). Anyway, these are two variables, two facets, and knowing how to mix them appropriately makes the whole difference. It's like internal combustion engine mixing few kinds of fuel. What you get at given moment depends on the mixture of these different qualities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652024</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this to help me read papers with mathematical notation in them. I screen share with https://aistudio.google.com/live and then ask (out loud) questions like "what do these symbols mean?" - it's a huge help for me, since I never memorized all of that stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool tech, but for some reason, the very first sentence in every reply the AI gives in the demo videos is really off-putting to me personally. It seems to me like perhaps this kind of joyful helpfulness introductory sentence is expected in US culture, but it immediately turned me off. I come from a culture that is less verbose in general and more to the point, so this feels like a mismatch right away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am getting extremely skeptical of AI “age”. I was hoping it will unlock a whole new generation of startups like the iPhone did. However genAI is too generic and too blunt a tool, as in it does everything. However it’s too expensive for a small company to do stuff with. Looks like these AI companies (google and OpenAI) realize that and so are even doing the vertical integration themselves. In such an event does genAI end up being the automation tool that you access/use through OpenAI or google and that’s it?I am sure people here see it better than I do, so what new class of problems is this genAI going to solve?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613463</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Playing In The Creek" focuses on the enriching experience of children playing outdoors, specifically in creeks and natural water environments. It emphasizes the importance of free play in nature for children's development, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and connection to the environment.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a nice article.  In a way though it kind of bypasses what I see as the main takeaways.It's not about AI development, it's about something mentioned earlier in the article: "make as much money as I can".  The problems that we see with AI have little to do with AI "development", they have to do with AI marketing and promulgation.  If the author had gone ahead and dammed the creek with a shovel, or blown off his hand, that would have been bad, but not that bad.  Those kinds of mistakes are self-limiting because if you're doing something for the enjoyment or challenge of it, you won't do it at a scale that creates more enjoyment than you personally can experience.  In the parable of the CEO and the fisherman, the fisherman stops at what he can tangibly appreciate.If everyone working on and using AI were approaching it like damming a creek for fun, we would have no problems.  The AI models we had might be powerful, but they would be funky and disjointed because people would be more interested in tinkering with them than making money from them.  We see tons of posts on HN every day about remarkable things people do for the gusto.  We'd see a bunch of posts about new AI models and people would talk about how cool they are and go on not using them in any load-bearing way.As soon as people start trying to use anything, AI or not, to make as much money as possible, we have a problem.The second missed takeaway is at the end.  He says Anthropic is noticing the coquinas as if that means they're going to somehow self-regulate.  But in most of the examples he gives, he wasn't stopped by his own realization, but by an external authority (like parents) telling him to stop.  Most people are not as self-reflective as this author and won't care about "winning zero sum games against people who don't necessarily deserve to lose", let alone about coquinas.  They need a parent to step in and take the shovel away.As long as we keep treating "making as much money as you can" as some kind of exception to the principle of "you can't keep doing stuff until you break something", we'll have these problems, AI or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent essay, and I feel similar to the author but couldn't express it as nicely.However if we are counting on AI researchers to take the advice and slow down then I wouldn't hold my breath waiting. The author indicated they stepped away from a high paying finance job for moral reasons, which is admirable. But wallstreet continues on and does not lack for people willing to play the "make as much money as you can" game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The story of playing at damming the creek or on the sand at the seaside is wholesome and brought a smile to my face. Cracking the "puzzle" is almost the bad ending of the game, if you don't get any fun at playing it anymore.People should spend more of their time doing things because they're fun, not because they want to get better at it.Maybe the apocalypse will happen in our lifetime, maybe not. I intend to have fun as much as I can in my life either way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43650656</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Why I Program in Lisp" outlines the author's passion for the Lisp programming language, emphasizing its unique features such as a simple syntax, powerful macro system, and flexibility that allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The author discusses the advantages of Lisp’s functional programming paradigm and its ability to facilitate complex problem-solving. Additionally, the piece highlights the strong community support and the rich ecosystem of libraries, which further enhance its appeal for both beginners and experienced programmers. The author ultimately advocates for Lisp as an ideal choice for those seeking a powerful and expressive language for software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article. Funnily enough the throw away line "I don't see parentheses anymore". Is my greatest deterrent with lisp. It's not the parens persay, it's the fact that I'm used to reading up to down and left to right. Lisp without something like the clojure macro -&gt;, means that I am reading from right to left, bottom to top - from inside out.If i programmed enough in lisp I think my brain would adjust to this, but it's almost like I can't full appreciate the language because it reads in the "wrong order".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever I hear someone talking about purely functional programming, no side effects, I wonder what kind of programs they are writing. Pretty much anything I've written over the last 30 years, the main purpose was to do I/O, it doesn't matter whether it's disk, network, or display. And that's where the most complications come from, these devices you are communicating with have quirks that need you need to deal with. Purely functional programming is very nice in theory, but how far can you actually get away with it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terry Pratchett's quote in one of his books (in fact I think this is a running gag, and appeared in multiple books):  Five exclamation marks, a sure sign of an insane mind

That's what I think about five closing parentheses too... But tbh I am also jealous, because I can't program in lisp at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43651576</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the persistent dangers of lead exposure on brain health, emphasizing that even low levels of lead can have significant neurotoxic effects. It outlines how lead can impair cognitive function, disrupt neurodevelopment in children, and contribute to mental health issues. The piece also highlights ongoing environmental and public health concerns regarding lead contamination in various settings, urging for continued awareness and action to mitigate exposure risks. Moreover, it stresses the importance of addressing lead sources to protect current and future generations from its harmful effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great article on the biology of lead exposure.Unfortunately on the exposure side research wasn’t done and it propagates the myth that lead exposure is only an issue for those with lead pipes or lead paint. It’s true that these are the main sources of severe lead exposure. However the article points out that there is no safe level of exposure to lead and these aren’t the main ways we are exposed to lead in the US anymore.Today we are mostly exposed by low level contamination and thankfully this usually results in only mildly elevated lead levels. In a toddler sticking things in the mouth this could be almost any object. For adults it is food and drinks and the objects we use to make them.I know this because my toddler had elevated lead levels even though our neighborhood never had lead paint and our water does not have lead (I tested the water coming out of our faucets).The US has few laws against lead contamination and they aren’t very stringent and there is little proactive enforcement. This non profit has ended up creating several recalls after reporting their own testing: https://tamararubin.com/category/recall/
Most of the recalls were products marketed for children such as baby bottles. But if a child eats off an adult plate there aren’t any laws against that being contaminated.Some actions you can take are:  * test children’s lead levels and your own
  * make sure toddlers aren't playing with old toys (pre 1978 really risky, after 2010 is best)
  * stop buying things that have a prop 65 warning (I know prop 65 isn’t perfect, but it’s often a lead warning).
  * Remove risky objects like the above from your children’s classrooms.
  * For cooking and food and drinks use clear glass, stainless steel, and cast iron
  * avoid processed foods. There are a lot of particulars here about what is most likely to be high in lead. Chocolate, spices, salt, and cassava products are particularly high in heavy metals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did you know, the world still mines more lead now than it did 50 years ago, at the peak of 'put lead in everything' mania?To me, this says that we still put lead in too many things.    Lead is still used for flashing in roofs.  It's still used as a mould release when making plastics.  It's still  used in making  dishware.  It's still used in bullets.It's still used for all kinds of things which will one day end up in the environment and someone's drinking water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live with children in a very old house.
I would love to be able to measure my children's lead exposure and check things like window paint or house dust for lead content to see how big a problem there is.How do I do that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43651532</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Erlang, emphasizing its strengths beyond lightweight processes and message passing. It outlines the language's robust features, including fault tolerance and concurrent programming, while addressing misconceptions about its primary applications. The author argues for a broader understanding of Erlang's capabilities, promoting it as a versatile tool for various programming tasks, and highlights its historical significance and relevance in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655221"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The amazing thing about Erlang and the BEAM is it's depth of features. To the OP the Behaviour/Interface of Erlang is their biggest take away. For me I believe it is how you require far far less development resources to build complex systems than you would require in any other language (provided comparable experience in both stacks). And for many the lightweight processes and programming model.OTP itself has so much in it. We've been working on compiling Elixir to run on iOS devices. Not only can we do that through the release process but through using the ei library provided in Erlang we can compile a Node in C that will interface with any other Erlang node over a typical distributed network as you would for Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, etc... furthermore there is a rpc library in Erlang where from C we can make function calls and interface with our Elixir application. Yes, the encoding/decoding has an overhead and FFI would be faster but we're still way within our latency budget and we got this stood up in a few days without even have heard of it before.The larger point here is that Erlang has been solving many of the problems that modern tech stacks are struggling with and it has solved for scale and implementation cost and it solved these problems decades ago. I know HN has a bit of a click-bait love relationship with Erlang/Elixir but it hasn't translated over to adoption and there are companies that are just burning money trying to do what you get out of the box for free with the Erlang stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not agree with the contents of this article. 
Behaviors are possible because of the underlying architecture of the system. Behaviors are not interfaces – they are more like abstract object in a language like Java so they implement basic and self-contained functionalities that are hidden behind a collaboration interface, but they couldn’t do much without the underlying infrastructure that makes sure that every process is totally separate from other processes, the that all processes can be safely closed without leaking memory, or resources, and that you cannot just share a rogue pointer between two different processes.What Joe did in his thesis is to show you how you can build reliable systems (and up point, reliable distribuited systems) by using a given set of Lego blocks.The reason why you need the erlang vm to implement something like that appropriately – and that you cannot do that fully on a different VM – is that without the underlying plumbing, supervision trees would be leaky - in Java, you cannot kill a thread that is holding up to resources and hope that everything will always go well, And do not have ways to monitor different processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve worked with a few individuals, mostly managers, who intended to write books informed by our experiences. It was always frustrating for me to see that we disagreed about what aspects of our work made us successful. There was always something they minimized as being nice that I felt was essential.And here we see someone claiming that lightweight processes and message passing aren’t the secret sauce, missing that Erlang as Communicating Sequential Processes is indivisible from those qualities, and then repeatedly mentioning CSP as part of the secret sauce.Examples:&gt; The application programmer writes sequential code, all concurrency is hidden away in the behaviour;&gt; Easier for new team members to get started: business logic is sequential, similar structure that they might have seen before elsewhere;&gt; Supervisors and the “let it crash” philosophy, appear to produce reliable systems. Joe uses the Ericsson AXD301 telephone switch example again (p. 191):Behaviors are interesting and solve a commonly encountered problem in the 80’s that was still being solved in some cases in the 00’s, but it’s a means as much as an end in Erlang. It’s how they implemented those other qualities. But I don’t know if they had to, to make Erlang still mostly be Erlang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655221</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Bonobos have been observed using a form of syntax in their communication that was previously believed to be exclusive to humans. Researchers found that these great apes can combine vocalizations in structured ways, showcasing a level of linguistic complexity. This behavior contributes to our understanding of language evolution and suggests that the capacity for syntax may not be uniquely human but rather a trait shared with other primates. The findings highlight the importance of studying non-human communication to gain insights into the origins of human language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612835"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is exciting times in animal communication.This is not just distributional information analysis in the sense that ‘tokens’ are grounded in other ‘tokens’. They’ve grounded these calls in naturalistic situational context. This is hard won data.If I understand, the finding here is that bonobo calls are “non-trivially” compositional, e.g., the semantic embeddings of pairs of vocalizations point in different directions surrounding the base vocalization. But it seems there is no “trivial” compositionality in the sense that constructions like [good __] might point in a similar direction. I would expect this latter result. This seems like a conspicuous absence? Is this really compositionality? Not sure what to make of it.Some interesting context: bonobos and other (non-human) great apes are believed to have more intentional and flexible control over their gestural repertoire than their vocal repertoire and that these gestural repertoires are larger. Human language likely evolved from gesture (or so some believe). So, if their vocalizations are in fact compositional, it may be a separate evolutionary prong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reinforcing my strongly held belief that what fundamentally sets humans apart isn't spoken language, or tools, or any of that, but rather the fact we write down what we know, then make those writings available to future generations to build on. We're a species distinguished from all others by our information-archival and -dissemination practices. We're an archivist species, a librarian species. Homo archivum. In my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now we have evidence that both chimps and bonobos have syntax, it is inevitable that this capacity for compositionality was inherited from our last common ancestor, says Leroux. “They just showed, unambiguously, that this core building block is evolutionary ancient and at least 7 million years old, and maybe even older.”This is not true at all.  It's like saying that tool construction must be &gt;300 million years old because both chimpanzees and New Caledonian crows make tools.  Things can be invented or discovered multiple times by different species.  It might be inherited from a common source, but it might not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612835</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to build real-time collaborative web applications using Clojure without relying on ClojureScript. It highlights the advantages of using Clojure for backend development and explores various technologies, such as WebSockets, to facilitate real-time communication. The author provides practical insights into architectural patterns and implementation details, demonstrating that Clojure's functional programming features can effectively support collaborative features in web apps. Overall, the piece encourages developers to leverage Clojure's strengths to create efficient and responsive web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've always liked about the Clojure community, is that they are obessesed with state.  I think they have correctly identified, that when things go sideways, it is because state management was involved in some way.  This is a cool front end approach using datastar to put all of the state on the backend and side step front end state management entirely.  There are some other really interesting things happening with electric clojure and a new "framework" called Replicant.  Of all of them, Replicant seems the most intriguing to me personally.  If it didn't exist, I think I would be trying to use datastar as this article outlines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two main high-level approaches for architecting web application client state:1. Client-heavy state management (separate client application)2. Client-light state management (thin client)The state has to be tracked and managed somewhere. In most web applications, that state is persistable - at some point, it will end up in a DB of some kind.As such, we already have to handle it on the server side, regardless of whether we also choose to separately manage it on the client side or not.So the question at the end of the day is: Do I want to separately manage the application state on the client side, when I am already managing it on the server side?In a lot of situations, the pragmatic answer would be "No". Why? Because managing the state in two places causes duplication, synchronisation issues, diverging logic issues, and so on. We are increasing the accidental complexity of our solution. Maintainability becomes slower, riskier and more expensive.For some applications, the extra complexity might be worth it. In most web applications I have worked with (eCommerce, internal business tools, booking systems, online calculators, business dashboards), it is not.And "let's keep all state and processing on the server" does not anymore mean no real-time or highly interactive features. With SSE and fast HTML fragment merging, we can enjoy highly interactive and performant web applications with almost no client-side application state management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked post relies on the Datastar project, which requires use of `unsafe-eval` in one’s Content-Security-Policy [1]:&gt; When using a Content Security Policy (CSP), unsafe-eval must be allowed for scripts, since Datastar evaluates expressions using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).The project itself links to Mozilla’s docs on CSP, which state:&gt; The unsafe-eval keyword can be used to override this behavior, and as with unsafe-inline, and for the same reasons: developers should avoid unsafe-eval.Out of the box, htmx uses a similar approach, but one can disable this use of eval [2]:  htmx.config.allowEval - can be set to false to disable all features of htmx that rely on eval:
  
  - event filters
  - hx-on: attributes
  - hx-vals with the js: prefix
  - hx-headers with the js: prefix

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of bilinear interpolation using quadrilateral barycentric coordinates, which is a method employed in computer graphics for texture mapping and image processing. It explains how bilinear interpolation allows for smooth transitions between pixel values when mapping textures onto 3D surfaces. The use of barycentric coordinates is highlighted as a way to interpolate values within a quadrilateral, making the process more efficient and accurate. Overall, the piece serves as an educational resource for understanding advanced techniques in graphics rendering and interpolation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To answer some of the questions here, the reason this has not been used before is because this technique requires being able to access the quad definitions (ie. which 4 vertices makeup each quad) within the gpu.Up until recently with Mesh Shaders, there's really just been no good way to send this data to the GPU and read back the barycentric coordinates you need in the fragment shader for each pixel.The article offers several options, to support older GPUs, like Geometry Shaders and Tesselation shaders. This is good, but these are really at best Terrible Hacks(tm). Proof of the ability to contort old extensions is not proof of reasonable performance!Notably, geometry shaders are notorious for bad performance, so the fact that they list them as a viable strategy for older devices makes it pretty clear they aren't thinking much about performance, just possible compatibility.Still, I think this is very cool, and now that GPUs are becoming much more of a generic computing device with the ability to execute arbitrary code on random buffers, I think we are nearly at the point of being able to break from the triangle and fix this! We hit this triangulation issue several times on the last project, and it's a real pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those things that feels like a broken/half-assed/oversimplified implementation got completely proliferated into the world a long time ago and it took several years for the right person to do a full-depth mathematical analysis to reveal what we should've been doing all along. Similar to antialiasing and sharpening, texture filtering, color spaces and gamma correction, etc.It reminded me of this article specifically: https://bgolus.medium.com/the-best-darn-grid-shader-yet-727f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am definitely not an expert in 3D graphics... but this looks such an astonishingly simple and effective method, it makes me to question why this wasn't already thought of and picked up?I get that with fixed-pipeline GPUs you do what the hardware and driver make you do, but with the advent of programmable pipelines, you'd though improving stuff like this would be the first things people do?Anyway, gotta run and implement this in my toy Metal renderer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43654912</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consultants are misused if employed on a constant basis instead of employing enough senior staff directly. There are well known drivers on both sides that tend to promote such an unhealthy setup. What is concerning at the US government is not cutting consulting but at the same time cutting staff and on top creating a hostile environment for senior staff. This is unprecedented and is not something one would do in the private sector except the most dire circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now the UK should swiftly follow suit in sacking these cowboys. The taxpayer is being charged extortionate rates in some cases for fresh graduates who know effectively nothing at all about what they talk about. At the same time, we should increase salary banding for technical roles to the market rate. We will get the experience we need for much, much less.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anecdotally, a friend of mine works for a state department of transportation and has been trying to get a developer and a DBA to replace some people who've recently left.He's been having an insanely hard time finding anyone for the role, and not because of salary requirements. He's required to vet candidates through approved sources and so his department uses a recruitment firm that keeps sending him resumes from people who are substantially lying about their experience and maybe also their identity. I tried recommending someone I knew who I knew had a lot of db experience and was job searching, and he said he wouldn't be able to interview the guy because he wasn't from an approved source.His best recent hire was a woman who understood the system well enough to create her own firm, get it govt approved, and then get herself hired as a consultant.Bear in mind I'm just recounting what my friend told me so I may have inaccuracies in this story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653004</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The website "WebRTC for the Curious" serves as a comprehensive guide to WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), providing an in-depth exploration of its concepts, architecture, and applications. It includes tutorials, examples, and practical insights aimed at developers and anyone interested in real-time communication technologies. The site covers the technical aspects of WebRTC, including signaling, peer-to-peer connections, and media handling, alongside hands-on projects to help users understand and implement WebRTC in their applications. Ultimately, it seeks to educate and inspire curiosity around the potential of real-time communication on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;WebRTC is lowkey one of the most underrated technologies out there, ESPECIALLY WebRTC data channels.WebRTC data channels are basically “UDP on the web” but they have lots of controls to change how reliable they are, so they can be used as TCP style connections as well.I still don’t fully understand why more people don’t use them over something like QUIC. (I think I’ve asked this question before here, but I wasn’t really satisfied with the answers)I sadly switched off of using them, but mostly because the ecosystem around there is super underdeveloped compared to the ecosystem around QUIC/quinn. There is a LOT of boilerplate involved that feels unnecessary.But, if you’re making a multiplayer game in the web, it’s basically the best technology to use cuz it already works. And if you use a library like libdatachannel or pion, you could make the game in Go or C++ and compile it for both Steam and the web!Here’s a project I did with them that shows off compiled for both web and desktop: https://github.com/ValorZard/gopher-combat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope everyone enjoys WebRTC for the Curious (I am one of the authors). If you have any ideas on how to make it better I would love to hear :)WebRTC is absolutely magical. Having 'Web' in the name does it a disservice. I see it used to.* Remotely control excavators* Security Cameras* Connect autonomous robots in factories* Low latency streaming from sail boats and rocket ships* And all the use cases you expect (Conferencing, Telehealth etc..)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can webrtc technology be used to pierce through corporate firewalls?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43654813</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From datastar's docs:&gt; Backend Setup&gt; Data star uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream zero or more events from the web server to the browser. There’s no special backend plumbing required to use SSE, just some syntax. Fortunately, SSE is straightforward and provides us with some advantages.As a django developer, this is very far from true. With htmx i get almost no backend changes (mainly in template code), where datastar would require me to rewrite to complete logic, and may not be possible to implement at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On thing about datastar vs htmx: Datastar embraces htmx's OOB swap and makes it a first class concept.HTMX's OOB swap appears to be an after thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want a solid demo of what you can do with datastar. You can checkout this naive multiplayer game of life I wrote earlier in the week. Sends down 2500 divs every 200ms to all connected cliends via compressed SSE.https://example.andersmurphy.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655914</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After playing the game for 10+ hours and dropping it out of sheer frustration, I came to the conclusion that I must have been playing a vastly different game than the people praising it.The first hour was great. I was constantly encountering new rooms and solving puzzles. The many times where the game decided to give me nothing but rooms leading to dead ends was annoying, but I still had things to explore in the next run so it didn't matter that much.
After that first hour, the game became a slog. I encountered the same rooms, solved the same two puzzles for resources and was constantly praying for the RNG to give me something new.
There is some RNG manipulation, but not enough to mitigate the boring part of the game.
There are a few interesting overarching puzzles, but most of them are wrapped in multiple layers of RNG.For example, for one puzzle you need a specific item that randomly spawns, use it in a room that randomly spawns which you need to unlock with another room that also randomly spawns.
It took me 6 hours for the game to give me a run where I got all three of those things in a single run.
The reward? Some resources that I have next to no use for and some clues that I can only experiment with if the RNG deems me worthy.I have absolutely no idea where the praise for the game comes from. Maybe this game is perfect for those who are really into roguelites, but for me personally it just feels like the game is wasting my time for no reason at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been playing this game and it is really a blast. The tutorial note cards strongly recommend using a pen+paper while playing and I can second that as pretty much required for some of the more "meta" puzzles.Worth noting that I believe it is also on Gamepass and whatever Sony's version of Gamepass is called if you already had those services and wished to save a few bucks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I don’t like what they do to me. I shudder to think how they could supercharge builders like Dorfromantik, Carcassonne, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig.A very similar mechanic is used in the popular board game Betrayal at House on the Hill. That game's arguably even worse because it has stat upgrades!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43628070</guid></item><item><title>24.

My go-to was Pro 8, since it's Carbonized you can run it natively on OS X (PPC or under Rosetta 1). It's possible to take the Pro 6 68k tools and use them in Pro 8 as well: https://github.com/macssh/macssh/wiki/Using-CWPro6's-68k-too...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an aside, I empathize with the author’s struggles to insert files with resource forks with resource forks-oblivious git.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree that merging the technology division from the ministry of economic affairs (BMWK) to the new research ministry is a good step as both ministries have been large providers of funding. The BMBF funds DFG, as well as the large science organizations in Germany (Fhg, Mpg, ...), the BMWK has funded research which is closer to applications, of course looking to enable economic activity.
I'm unsure why the ministry gets a special focus on aerospace, this topic is being worked on by the DLR, funded by BMBF. 
I'm also not yet sure what to think about splitting education and research. It goes against the Humboldtian Ideal, especially in the universitys both topics are connected. On the other hand, it might enable the ministries to be more focused and do reforms that don't depend on each other to be performed more quickly.
The research ministry will go to CSU, the bavarian sister party of CDU. While it may not be very popular amongst many Germans, because CSU is seen as conservative and individual CSU politicians are not famous science policymakers, Bavaria is a successful science hub. Munich is home to international leading institutions (TUM, MPG, FhG). Bavaria is also a hub for aerospace with Aibus and MTU and startups like Isar Aerospace and Rocket Factory Augsburg. Maybe repeating what bavarian policymakers have done regionally to the whole of Germany will be good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But the real test will be follow-through. Big promises like "world's first fusion reactor" and wooing global talent sound great, but without a clear budget or streamlined bureaucracy, it risks becoming just another shiny headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The upside is that this will actually provide lots of research funding to small companies. Think of it like the seed round from a VC, but instead of investing into new companies, they try to strategically invest into existing companies to boost future tax revenue.It'll probably be very German, meaning overly bureaucratic. But the basic idea of financing R&amp;D in small companies to grow them more competitive seems legit to me.As an example of what was funded by similar German government grants, you can look at voize, which is (by now) also a YC company: https://en.voize.de/uber-unsEDIT: Here's some German info on the 1.98 mio € research grant from early 2022 (meaning it was awarded shortly before they joined the W22 YC batch): https://www.interaktive-technologien.de/projekte/pysa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658060</guid></item><item><title>26.

Background: I would like to use it as a runtime in order to allow for nesting containers in my CI pipelines, which is difficult with standard OCI runtimes like runc/crun without granting them privileges or at least additional capabilities that AppArmor is not happy about.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the necessity of WebSockets in modern web applications, challenging the common belief that they are essential for real-time communication. It argues that many use cases can effectively be handled using simpler technologies such as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with techniques like long polling or server-sent events. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem requirements and suggests that, in many scenarios, these simpler solutions can provide sufficient performance and functionality without the complexity of implementing WebSockets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a minor point in the article, but sending a RequestID to the server so that you get request/response cycles isn't weird nor beyond the pale.It's pretty much always worth it to have an API like `send(message).then(res =&gt; ...)` in a serious app.But I agree. The upgrade request is confusing, and it's annoying how your websocket server is this embedded thing running inside your http server that never integrates cleanly.Like instead of just reusing your middleware that reads headers['authorization'] from the websocket request, you access this weird `connectionParams` object that you pretend are request headers, heh.But the idiosyncrasies aren't that big of a deal (ok, I've just gotten used to them). And the websocket browser API is nicer to work with than, say, EventSource.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I usually start with the long polling/SSE and migrate to WebSockets when needed. It is cheap and reliable with almost no performance overhead when compared to WebSockets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; If it wasn’t, we couldn’t stream video without loading the entire file firstI don't believe this is correct. To my knowledge, video stream requests chunks by range and is largely client controlled. It isn't a single, long lived http connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43659370</guid></item><item><title>30.

What exactly makes running Ollama within virtualized NixOS in WSL in some way better than running natively?If it's just the novelty aspect of it or some idealogical reason, that's fine, but it should be explained in the blog post before someone thinks this is a sane and logical way to run Ollama on a gaming PC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would dare guess the author just doesn’t know there is a perfectly functional Windows native Ollama release. I was doing the same thing until I realized that it makes no sense because I can just install ollama on Windows and then connect to it from within WSL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others have already pointed out if you're going to run Ollama in Windows anyway, why not use the native build? And if you want to use WSL, then I'd suggest using something like LocalAI which gives you a lot more control and support for additional formats (GGML, GGUF, GPTQ, ONNX, etc).https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649711</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery that the Sahara Desert was once a lush environment that supported a unique group of prehistoric humans. This period, which occurred thousands of years ago, allowed for the development of a distinct culture and way of life, highlighting the adaptability of human populations to changing climates. Researchers have uncovered artifacts and evidence that suggest this group had a complex society, challenging previous assumptions about human habitation in extreme environments. The findings provide new insights into human migration and the impact of climate change on ancient populations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are around 10,000 megalith structures in the Sahara, most of which were constructed between 3000 and 2000 BC, when desertification was well underway.  A large number of these were discovered within the last 20 years using Google Earth.  The megaliths come in a wide variety of shapes (there are around 40 categories), but the more sophisticated megaliths have a keyhole shape [1].Like the better known megaliths in Europe they tend to have astronomical alignments and have been used as funerary monuments.  Most of the megaliths point east and have male skeletons, but the few megaliths with female skeletons are oriented towards the west.(Shameless plug, but for anyone interested in learning more about this sort of thing I have a podcast about the history of astronomy and one of the episodes is about the astronomy of Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa [3].)[1]: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Two-keyhole-structures-i...[2]: https://songofurania.com/episode/029&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A large part of the human history remains unknown because the Sahara is very difficult to explore and study.

Instead of training an AI to produce a tonne of JS to create something that's been done before, should we not be engineering better tools to allow people to precisely craft software without the need for AI.I worry that because we are now able to instantly produce a bunch of JS to do X thing, we will be incentivized not to change the underlying tools (because one, only AI's are using it, and two AI's won't know how to use the new thing)I worry this will stall progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is impressive honestly.I also find it interesting that the ai code submissions like this one are generally vague about the process.This seem to be created using Cline on VsCode, prompting to Gemini 2.5 Pro using OpenRouter.The commit history implies that a crude version was created by the LLM using an initial prompt and then gradually improved with features, fixes etc. Assuming ongoing conversations with the AI agent.All code in a single index.html file which might not be great for human coders but who cares to be fair.All in all, a prompt history would be really educational if anyone thinks about doing something similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this is too stressful, I created my own star based relaxation game yesterday before boarding a plane. Sadly did not get much traction.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title should mention the 2023 year, as reference for "recent".As explained in the article, this is actually old news.There has been more than a decade since it is well known that the hexapods a.k.a. insects have evolved from within a certain group of crustaceans, which includes the water fleas.The 2023 research paper linked in the article has only provided stronger evidence for this.The main implication of this discovery is that the myriapods (e.g. millipedes and centipedes) are much more remotely related to insects than it has been believed in the past and they have adapted to a terrestrial life completely independently and much earlier than the insects (the invasion of the land by major animal groups has happened in the order myriapods, then arachnids, then hexapods a.k.a. insects, then tetrapod vertebrates, by a coincidence in decreasing order of the number of legs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm so used to seeing the "fish crawling onto the shore" cartoon of evolution that I assumed the branching always went that way - land creatures are branchoffs of sea creatures. But surely this is oversimplified - are there examples in the other direction, where a branching occured in land animals and one branch then returned to the sea?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a fairly science focused article I was a little surprised they referred to "bugs" in the casual / technically incorrect manner, as covered here:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect#Distinguishing_featur...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658093</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;Rust-CUDA provides a framework for developing CUDA applications using Rust, combining the safety and performance of Rust with the parallel computing power of CUDA. The repository offers tools, libraries, and examples to help developers write GPU-accelerated code in Rust, enabling efficient management of memory and resources while maintaining type safety. It aims to create a seamless integration between Rust and CUDA, allowing for more robust and high-performance graphics and computations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary, from someone who uses CUDA on rust in several projects (Computational chemistry and cosmology simulations):  - This lib has been in an unusable and unmaintained state for years. I.e., to get it working, you need to use specific, several-years-old variants of both rustc, and CUDA.
  - It was recently rebooted. I haven't tried the Github branch, but there isn't a release yet. Has anyone verified if this is working on current Rustc and CUDA yet?
  - The Cudarc library (https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc) is actively maintained, and works well. It does not, however, let you share host and device data structures; you will [de]serialize as a byte stream, using functions the lib provides. Works on any (within past few years at least) CUDA version and GPU.

I highlight this as a trend I see in software libs, in Rust more than others: The projects that are promoted the most are often not the most practical or well-managed ones. It's not clear from the description, but maybe rust-CUDA intends to allow shared data structures between host and device? That would be nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using the cudarc crate professionally for a while to write and call cuda from rust. Can highly recommend. You don’t have to use super old rustc versions. Although I haven’t looked exactly what you do need to use recently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool to see this project get rebooted. I'm hoping it will have the critical mass needed to actually take off. Writing CUDA kernels in C++ is a pain.In theory, since the NVVM IR is based on LLVM IR, rust in CUDA should be quite doable. In practice, though, of course it is an extreme amount of work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43654881</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a groundbreaking technique developed by researchers that utilizes sound waves to levitate and stabilize insects for high-resolution photography. This innovative approach aims to enhance scientific imaging by allowing researchers to capture detailed images of small subjects without the interference of physical surfaces or traditional mounting methods. By controlling the movement and position of the insects using acoustic fields, this method could significantly improve the quality of scientific photography in entomology and other fields, offering new insights into insect anatomy and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

You don't have control over the orientation, but that doesn't matter if you can take the pictures fast enough while it is tumbling around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to play:1. scattered throughout the level are flagpoles with two-letter names on the flag2. you are given a list of numeric coordinates which are locations to a subset of the flagpoles, in the format (map section)(xx.xx)(yy.yy), as well that of as your starting point3. the objective is to navigate to those coordinates to record the two-letter names of those flags. A UI will open when you walk up to each flag asking if you want to fill in the answer.4. you are given a map with the corresponding xy grids delineated, place the mini flags according to the given coordinates to help locate yourself on the map. (remember that your starting coordinate is given to you as well)5. the game ends when you have filled out all of the coordinates' corresponding two-letter names, at which point the correct answer will be revealed for you to compare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to play is explained here [1]By the way you can run the games locally.
Just download all files.For the forest game you would have a local directory:   ├── Build
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.asm.code.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.asm.framework.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.asm.memory.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.data.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.json
   │   └── UnityLoader.js
   └── index.html

then just run the following in the directory    python3 -m http.server

[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a74KM792gbo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't know the objective, so I created my own simple one: get to the lake because I'm thirsty. Then I created another one: get back to where I started so I can bring water to my injured companion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624799</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the European Union's key principles regarding in-game virtual currencies, emphasizing the need for consumer protection, transparency, and fairness in the gaming industry. It highlights the importance of ensuring that players are informed about the risks associated with these currencies, including the potential for loss and lack of regulation. Additionally, the EU stresses the necessity of preventing fraudulent practices and encourages games to implement measures that uphold ethical standards for in-game purchases. Overall, the principles aim to create a safer and more trustworthy environment for gamers engaging with virtual currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow! Unexpected and cool to see this post on Hacker News! Since then we have evolved our VM infra a bit, and I've written two more posts about this.First, we started cloning VMs using userfaultfd, which allows us to bypass the disk and let children read memory directly from parent VMs [1].And we also moved to saving memory snapshots compressed. To keep VM boots fast, we need to decompress on the fly as VMs read from the snapshot, so we chunk up snapshots in 4kb-8kb pieces that are zstd compressed [2].Happy to answer any questions here![1]: https://codesandbox.io/blog/cloning-microvms-using-userfault...[2]: https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-scale-our-microvm-infrast...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The VM vs container debate is fascinating. They are separate yet slowly merging concepts that are becoming more blurred as technology becomes cheaper and faster. If the real bottleneck to scale is adaptable code, then it is foolish to dismiss the VM as outdated tech  when it can be completely rehomed in 2 seconds. That megabyte of python code managing your containers would still be busy checking it's dependencies in that same timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unmentioned:    there are serious security issues with memory cloning code not designed for it.For example, an SSL library might have pre-calculated the random nonce for the next incoming SSL connection.If you clone the VM containing a process using that library, now both child VM's will use the same nonce.     Some crypto is 100% broken open if a nonce is reused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622514</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the pervasive pessimism reflected in the TV show "Black Mirror," exploring its commentary on technology and society. It examines how the series portrays the darker aspects of modern life, including the consequences of technological advancements on human relationships and morality. The piece also analyzes audience reactions to the show's bleak narratives and considers its cultural impact, questioning whether such depictions of technology are merely cautionary tales or if they reflect deeper societal fears about the direction of humanity's future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, i guess i both agree and disagree with this article.I disagree that black mirror has to save the world. Art doesn't have to literally save the world to be useful, it just has to add to the conversation. The fact we are talking about it proves that it has.On the other hand, i've never really liked black mirror that much. It feels polemical to me. Its unrelenting pessimism robs it of nuance, which makes it feel flat to me. To be clear it doesn't have to be happy, it can still be grim and dark, but when every character is a terrible character, it undermines the storyTake the episode "nosedive" where everyone is obsessed with social media ratings. Compare it to other people who copied it (meow meow beans in community, or majority rule in the orvile). I think the other tv shows did it better and honestly made technology look worse, because they had characters that weren't cartoon villians.Maybe the part i don't like about black mirror is not that it showd technology stripping people of their hummanity but that all its characters already lack humanity so there is nothing to strip, which is kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I disagree with the premise of this article.Sometimes an extremely pessimistic vision of a possible future CAN change things...by making it so people are determined to fight to prevent that possible future from ever happening.The novel 1984 by George Orwell was published in 1948. It is an extremely pessimistic vision of a possible future for mankind....and many of us over the generations who read it really really did not want to live in such a future and acted accordingly.Black Mirror's pessimism could be similar.Also in Black Mirror technology in of itself is never portrayed as inherently bad in any episode. It is the people and the way they choose to use the technology that leads to the horror. In that way every Black Mirror episode has that element of optimism. If only each new piece of tech in reality could ever be introduced so we maximize the positives rather than the negatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not that Black Mirror is bad. It's that, as the article points out, we don't have a fictional vision of the future to use as a goal.The author mentions Jill Lapore's 2017 article in the New Yorker, which is sort of a survey paper of dystopian fiction from that period.[1] No alternatives are presented.For most of human history, the big problem was making enough stuff. There just wasn't any way to make enough stuff for everybody. In the 20th century, high volume manufacturing got going. By the 1950s, the US had this totally worked out. At long last, society really could make enough stuff for everybody.
Science fiction of the 1950s is mostly utopian. With scarcity conquered, the future looked bright.But it didn't work out.Think about why for a while. I'll wait.[1] https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/a-golden-age-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648890</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide on how to make a longbow, detailing the necessary materials, tools, and step-by-step instructions for crafting a traditional wooden bow. It includes information on bow types, dimensions, and design considerations, as well as tips on wood selection and shaping techniques.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shooting barebow recurve / horsebow is one of the most zen-like experiences I've had. And it's a workout!I would encourage anyone remotely interested to take lessons before you start practicing on your own to prevent bad habits or to prevent from hurting your fingers/hands/shoulders. Trainers should have light-weight bows, around 16# or so for you to try.
Etsy is a good place to buy accessories (tabs, quivers, gloves, rings, etc.).I've bought arrows/bows from these folks and really like what I received:https://www.szimeiszterbows.hu/https://asianbows.com/And for less expensive carbon arrows, I have a few different sets from https://linkboyarchery.com/. Really good stuff.Lancasterarchery.com is a US-based outfit that has a variety of good equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 years ago, I had a Honduran roommate who barely spoke English. One day he came home with a thrift store VHS on how to make longbows and he watched that thing over and over like it would tell him the meaning of life. I hope he finally got ahold of some yew wood and made one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've made a self-bow (ie a longbow from a single piece of wood) - under instruction it took a couple of days with some simple, but very sharp, tools.If you're going the laminate route do yourself a favour and buy some pre-laminated wood designed for the pressures a bow needs to take. The results of laminate cracking and splintering near your eye don't really bear thinking about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652160</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common issues faced by the PlayStation 3 (PS3), particularly the "Yellow Light of Death" (YLOD) and other hardware failures. It provides an overview of the symptoms of these problems, possible causes, and suggestions for troubleshooting or repairing the console. The author shares personal experiences and insights to help users understand the risks associated with these failures and offers guidance on whether to attempt repairs themselves or seek professional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember trying to learn Cell programming in 2006 using IBM’s own SDK (possibly different and less polished compared to whatever Sony shipped to licensed PS3 developers).I had already spent a few years writing fragment shaders, OpenGL, and CPU vector extension code for 2D graphics acceleration, so I thought I’d have a pretty good handle on how to approach this new model of parallel programming. But trying to do anything with the SDK was just a pain. There were separate incompatible gcc toolchains for the different cores, separate vector extensions, a myriad of programming models with no clear guidance on anything… And the non-gcc tools were some hideous pile of Tcl/TK GUI scripts with a hundred buttons on the screen.It really made me appreciate how good I’d had it with Xcode and Visual Studio. I gave up on Cell after a day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It is important to understand why the PS3 failedThat's a weird assertion for a console that sold 87M units, ranks #8 in the all-time top-selling consoles list, and marginally outsold Xbox360 which is compared against in TFA.See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_cons...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With an SPU's 256K local memory and DMA, the ideal way to use the SPU was to split the local memory into 6 sections: code, local variables, DMA in, input, output, DMA out. That way you could have async DMA in parallel in both directions while you transform your inputs to your outputs. That meant your working space was even smaller...Async DMA is important because the latency of a DMA operation is 500 cycles! But, then you remember that the latency of the CPU missing cache is also 500 cycles... And, gameplay code misses cache like it was a childhood pet. So, in theory you just need to relax and get it working any way possible and it will still be a huge win. Some people even implemented pointer wrappers with software-managed caches.500 cycles sounds like a lot. But, remember that the PS2 ran at 300MHz (and had a 50 cycle mem latency) while the PS3 and 360 both ran at 3.2Ghz (and both had a mem latency of 500 cycles).  Both systems pushed the clock rate much higher than PCs at the time. But, to do so, "niceties" like out-of-order execution were sacrificed. A fixed ping-pong hyperthreading should be good enough to cover up half of the stall latency, right?Unfortunately, for most games the SPUs ended up needing to be devoted full time to making up for the weakness of the GPU (pretty much a GeForce 7600 GT). Full screen post processing was an obvious target. But, also the vertex shaders of the GPU needed a lot of CPU work to set them up. Moving that work to the SPUs freed up a lot of time for the gameplay code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43656279</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"new and unique cinematic experience"Neither new nor unique. It's been done, many times. The classic is Kinoautomat, 1967.[1]Much video game design revolves around how to keep to the plot while giving the user some freedom. If the user is locked to a path, the game is called a "track ride". If the user can do whatever they want, it's an open-world game. Resolving that dichotomy is hard, but has been done successfully many times. GTA V is a good example.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoautomat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This raises a fundamental question about the role of Art in society. If I want to see all the content in this film I will have to watch it the rest of my life. This is great if I'm making money off of the content but terrible if I'm just curious about Brian Eno and want to see a well assembled, curated interview with him. Producing content with an AI that will re-edit the film on each watch makes post production easy for creators but leaves the task of editing on the viewer, like ringing up your groceries at the market. So why then does content exist? Is it to entertain viewers, to attract eyeballs to ads or as an outlet to creatives? I'd argue it should be a balance of the first and last (ads are a necessary evil today, but creative texts were not invented to provide context for advertising). Work that is fan service often doesn't provide the outlet desired by the creative and work that challenges the creative often bores the audience. This seems like it falls in the second category. No disrespect to Brian Eno.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading about this documentary I became interested in watching, turns out I can't. Thanks for nothing I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615844</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a unique laboratory at a nuclear power plant designed to study acoustics and its implications for safety and operational efficiency. By analyzing sound waves within the plant's systems, researchers aim to detect issues such as leaks or component failures that could indicate potential hazards. The use of advanced acoustics can contribute to improved monitoring and maintenance strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of nuclear power facilities. This innovative approach highlights the intersection of technology and energy management in the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ron is a fixture at acoustics conferences, he's a nice guy and was very passionate about making the facility work when he was raising funds in the aughts. If you're going to be in the area and give him enough notice, he'll be happy to give you a tour.Last I heard (which was admittedly about 10 years ago, things may have changed since then), the facility was struggling a bit. It's true that these types of testing facilities need quiet background noise levels for testing, but that can usually be achieved either through putting the facility in the middle of nowhere, or over-engineering the structure. NWAA obviously has both, but that results in increased costs. On the other hand, you have facilities like Orfield Labs and Microsoft's newest anechoic chamber that manage to be _very_ quiet while still located in relatively convenient areas. Plus many audio/speaker/acoustical products companies have their own facilities.That said I'm glad NWAA is still getting press and I hope it remains a fixture for generations to come. We need more of these moonshots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related: Underwater scenes for the movie, "The Abyss", were filmed in an incomplete nuclear power plant in South Carolina.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Nuclear_Power_Plant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article doesn’t explain it, but the reason why you want a large space to measure loudspeakers is that your measuring frequency range is determined by the time it takes until the first reflection arrives, which you can exclude by using a windowing function in your measuring software. You only want the direct sound emanating from the DUT, not the reflections (unless you’re interested in room correction).The larger the space, the lower the frequency you can still measure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43621926</guid></item><item><title>45.

I maintain that trying to transition the product away from PHP into a React-ridden mess for the "Block Editor" in 2017 started us down this path of ruin.Clearly they felt threatened by site builder plugins like Elementor Pro, Beaver Builder, Bricks and others that massively improved the WYSIWYG experience to the point where WP was relegated to the role of invisible scaffolding, a dumb pipe.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation tools, while designed to protect against large-scale attacks, can inadvertently cause data leaks and other vulnerabilities. It highlights potential risks that arise when these tools are improperly configured or when they encounter unexpected traffic patterns. The author emphasizes the need for organizations to thoroughly understand the limitations and side effects of their DDoS mitigation solutions, and advocates for a tailored approach to security that addresses both the intended protective functions and possible unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the FastCGI interface, explaining its advantages in web development, particularly its ability to enhance performance and scalability by allowing web servers to communicate efficiently with external applications. It highlights the history and evolution of FastCGI, comparing it to other technologies like CGI, and emphasizes its benefits for handling high traffic loads and concurrent connections. The author reflects on the relevance of FastCGI in modern web applications and encourages developers to consider its use in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went down this rabbit hole a while ago[1], it's a fun experience to try out technologies that nowadays are considered unconventional or outdated.[1]: https://deadlime.hu/en/2023/11/24/technologies-left-behind/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  If you find yourself with a scripted language where processing HTTP requests might be too slow or unsafe, I can still see some utility for FastCGI. For most of the rest of us, HTTP won, just write little HTTP webservers.

Without serious development effort, I would expect using an existing web server with FastCGI is faster than writing your own web server. It is also more secure as the FastCGI application can be run as a different user in a chroot, or a namespace based sandbox like a docker container.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's baffling how FastCGI ever was popular, considering how weird it's premise is: let's take this well-known standard simple text based protocol and convert it to our own custom binary protocol, that will make writing services somehow simpler?! You are still dealing with all the complexity of writing a daemon, only difference is that instead of parsing HTTP you parse FastCGI.Maybe today with all the complexity that is with http2/http3 etc it would make slightly more sense. But FastCGI was popular when all the world was just good old plain http1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620676</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in the embedded space. I'd absolutely love to have a tool to build immutable, signed distro images which I can push to devices with a/b style updates. I imagine you can do this with mkosi, but it doesn't quite feel like the intended use case.Most immutable distros (this included) are developed with the idea that you'd run local commands on the machine, and update a single OS image in place. That gets pretty unwieldy to manage across a fleet of devices.Right now the industry standard tooling for building truly immutable images for embedded devices is Yocto. It works well, but it's incredibly complicated and has ridiculous build times because it insists on building every single package from source. It's utter madness that building a Linux image for a common ARM64 processor requires me to compile the Rust compiler myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m somewhat a fan of systemd and I’m interested in immutable images, but I don’t want to build systemd from source:&gt;Sometimes ParticleOS adopts systemd features as soon as they get merged into systemd without waiting for an official release. As a result it's recommended to build systemd from source when building ParticleOS to make sure all required features are supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is ParticleOS also a useful everyday driver for Linux enthusiasts who aren't systemd developers? Let's say I got bored with Gentoo and I want to try something new. Is ParticleOS something that a technical user would enjoy at the current stage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649088</guid></item><item><title>50.

[…]&gt; [The researchers] discovered that the process [of forming microplastics] begins in the soft layers, which grow weaker over time due to environmental degradation and can break off even when the plastic is not under stress. By themselves, these soft pieces break down quickly in the environment. Problems arise when the failure of a soft layer allows hard layers to break off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sooner we stop producing and consuming plastic in all its forms, the better for all life on Earth. There was life before plastic - it used wood, glass, metal, and natural fabric. It was not that long ago, certainly within my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still wonder when we will see the emergence of evolutionary adapted life to this. Bacteria able to diggest plastic.
Mikrobial lifeforms using plastic as a sort of shield from detection ("think of a dissease") using mayflylarva like structures made of microplastics to shield from detection by white blood cells.
I also curious wether misfiring defense detection due to plastic residue is responsible for  allergic reaction disease on the rise in recent years. It would start where the plastic arrives- in the colon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624135</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article doesn't mention TPUs anywhere. I don't think it's obvious for people outside of google's ecosystem just how extraordinarily good the JAX + TPU ecosystem is. Google several structural advantages over other major players, but the largest one is that they roll their own compute solution which is actually very mature and competitive. TPUs are extremely good at both training and inference[1] especially at scale. Google's ability to tailor their mature hardware to exactly what they need gives them a massive leg up on competition. AI companies fundamentally have to answer the question "what can you do that no one else can?". Google's hardware advantage provides an actual answer to that question which can't be erased the next time someone drops a new model onto huggingface.[1]https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/ironwood-tpu-age-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google is winning on every front except... marketing (Google has a chatbot?), trust (who knew the founding fathers were so diverse?), safety (where's the 2.5 Pro model card?), market share (fully one in ten internet users on the planet are weekly ChatGPT users), and, well, vibes (who's rooting for big G, exactly?).But I will admit, Gemini Pro 2.5 is a legit good model. So, hats off for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is sort of funny to me how the sentiment about whoever seems to be leading in ML changes so frequently (in particular here on HN.) A couple months ago it felt like people were sure that Google completely fucked it up for themselves (especially due to the fact that they invented the transformer but didn't productize it themselves at first.)For a short while, Claude was the best thing since sliced cheese, then Deepseek was the shit, and now seemingly OpenAI really falls out of favor. It kinda feels to me like people cast their judgement too early (perhaps again in this case.) I guess these are the hypecycles...Google is killing it right now, I agree.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many moons ago, William Gibson did a piece for Wired about his obsession with mechanical watches[1]. The whole thing is worth a read but this bit is worth quoting:"""
Mechanical watches are so brilliantly unnecessary.Any Swatch or Casio keeps better time, and high-end contemporary Swiss watches are priced like small cars. But mechanical watches partake of what my friend John Clute calls the Tamagotchi Gesture. They're pointless in a peculiarly needful way; they're comforting precisely because they require tending.And vintage mechanical watches are among the very finest fossils of the pre-digital age. Each one is a miniature world unto itself, a tiny functioning mechanism, a congeries of minute and mysterious moving parts. Moving parts! And consequently these watches are, in a sense, alive. They have heartbeats. They seem to respond, Tamagotchi-like, to "love," in the form, usually, of the expensive ministrations of specialist technicians. Like ancient steam-tractors or Vincent motorcycles, they can be painstakingly restored from virtually any stage of ruin.
"""https://web.archive.org/web/20240930092315/https://www.wired...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I happen to work in this industry, and just a word for those that compare this with an Apple Watch or a Casio, this Vacheron-Constantin will likely be around 200 years from now, it will still be a testimony of the refinement and engineering of a fine craft that few can achieve, a highly valued item with specialist technicians marvelling on the talent of its builders, just as is the case today with 200 year old timepieces.you'll be very lucky if your Casio can last as long. Your mass commoditised Apple watch will likely be worthless.Personaly, I like the IWC on my wrist as much as I like my Casio G-Shock, both are wonderful in their own way.The Apple watch on my wife's wrist is a fine computer i guess, but at some point, it will have the same "quaint charm" as the IBM Thinkpad she owned 23 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I became interested in complicated watches several years ago and knew I could never afford one, so I made a website with simulated watch dials. Just for fun and education. It was also a great way for me to learn svg animations.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an introvert that’s been consciously working to make new friends, I’ve noticed a couple phenomena:- I’d love to be friends with other introverts to enjoy quiet times together. but… int-to-int pairs will rarely form in nature, however extroverts are great for mediating the connections. Make friends with the talkative outgoing types, because through them you can meet the other quiet people they’ve befriended but you’d never meet in the wild.- however, there seem to be some common pitfalls to introvert-extrovert friendships. From my (introvert) side, you can often find yourself getting insecure or jealous of all the other social connections that your extrovert friends have. There’s an asymmetry there that can feed lots of insecurities. I’m sure that there’s something equivalent from the other direction, but I dont know what it is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a childhood friend that I went to school with for all of my school days. Ever since school days, we find the same obscure things funny and always end up in splits whenever we talk. To this day, I don't have this with any other friend.We had a few years' gap of not really being in touch during undergrad but that changed as we had a few months' overlap at post-grad university. It was easier to meet after that and we did keep in touch, but I felt that he was holding back somewhat and not really being free with his thoughts, letting the conversation flag at times.So at a friend's wedding a couple of years ago, I opened up to him and plainly told him that it's a shame we don't talk as we used to as we both are clearly on the same wavelength when it comes to shared interests and sense of humour. And this worked - our degree of friendship has increased an order of magnitude since before that time. I would have lost a great friend to the vagaries of life had I not taken that step to become vulnerable for an instant then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mutual sacrifice is the glue that takes time to set.Mutual interest propels activity, but reliable sacrifice is the basis of trust and reliance.But if you are perceived as welching on this, you will induce real and lasting anger, justifiably in my mind because  you’ve just made it harder for people to trust for the rest of their lives.And this is not limited to close friends.A girlfriend’s mom’s advice: trust your man only after he’s crawled over a mile of broken glass, and your boss when he’s done it underwater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619032</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and versatility of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) art in web design. It highlights the advantages of using SVG over traditional image formats, such as scalability without loss of quality, smaller file sizes, and the ability to manipulate images through CSS and JavaScript. The piece also provides examples of SVG use cases, tips for creating SVG art, and emphasizes its growing popularity in modern web development due to its responsiveness and visual appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

https://youtu.be/ADXX4fmWHbo?si=6YPZkopyEDc8PSte&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really miss Macromedia Flash. There wasn't a single tech like Flash and SWF format which flourished with so many indie games and animated movies available without any extra downloads (other than Flash Player). Barier to entry was so low.Now, take SVG, it has potential to do everything what SWF could. But there is no editor like Flash and scene/object based coding solution like ActionScript. And each browser has own quirks so only simple SVG is guaranteed to be displayed everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unkey's landing page is a nice example.That landing page is a nauseatingly laggy experience on a very powerful M1 Pro laptop. And slow to load, all for some fancy lines? I'd take a product that focuses on substance over style as dev. Don't get me wrong, style is important and I like pretty things, but here it seems the tradeoff is not well done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43666439</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;Adobe faced significant backlash after deleting posts related to its Bluesky initiative, leading to a heated debate among the photography community. Many users criticized Adobe's decision to engage with Bluesky, a social media platform, due to concerns over censorship and the potential impact on creative freedom. The backlash highlights the sensitivity around corporate actions in the digital space and the importance of transparency in communication. The article discusses the implications of such controversies for Adobe and its user base.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adobe runs what must be one of the largest deceptive rebills. The vast majority of users signing up for a monthly plan do not realize that it is actually an "annual plan, billed monthly" and thus that if they cancel after one month (for example) they'll be billed for the remaining 11 immediately. I honestly don't know how they haven't faced FTC action for this, as it's been their primary model for 5-10 years now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adobe is the one major company trying to be ethical with its AI training data and no one seems to even care. The AI features in Photoshop are the best around in my experience and come in handy constantly for all sorts of touchup work.Anyway I don't really think they deserve a lot of the hate they get, but I do hope this encourages development of viable alternatives to their products. Photoshop is still pretty much peerless. Illustrator has a ton of competitors catching up. After Effects and Premiere for video editing are getting overtaken by Davinci Resolve -- though for motion graphics it is still hard to beat After Effects. Though I do love that Adobe simply uses JavaScript for its expression and scripting language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, they posted this:&gt; Hey, we're Adobe! We're here to connect with the artists, designers, and storytellers who bring ideas to life. What's fueling your creativity right now?&gt; Drop a reply, tag a creator, or share your latest work—we'd love to see what inspires you!That's such a bland, corporate message. It feels totally inauthentic. Do Adobe (a corporation) really "love to see what inspires you" or do they just want engagement for their new account?I'm not surprised in the slightest that it triggered a pile-on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653885</guid></item><item><title>8.

Banning cars outright also works, of course, but I suspect a lot of the reduction can be attributed to getting particularly bad diesel cars out vs. the limited areas where cars are entirely restricted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honestly, kind of amazing to see a big city actually pull it off. So many places talk about reducing car dependence and improving air quality, but Paris really committed - and the data speaks for itself. Of course, the pushback from drivers was inevitable (it always is), but it's hard to argue with 55% less PM2.5 and cleaner skies over the Eiffel Tower. That's not just good urban policy - that's public health in action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665793</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores a case where an individual leveraged insider information to significantly increase their investment returns, specifically achieving a 28-fold increase in a mere 60 seconds. It delves into the mechanisms of insider trading, the legal implications surrounding it, and the ethical considerations of gaining unfair financial advantages.

We don’t know what they knew.Actually, “we”, collectively, do know, because the SEC maintains an “XKEYSCORE for equities” called CAT.If there was interest, the government could know exactly who placed these trades. But the call (options) are coming from inside the house.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;404 Media reported a story on Monday[1] about a news outlet that claimed there'd be a 90-day break on tariffs for all countries besides China. This was published a few days before the official announcement.So someone, somewhere, knew something before everyone else.[1] https://www.404media.co/benzinga-news-service-that-falsely-r...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These sort of trades happy fairly regularly, before market breaking news in individual stock names.Just search for SEC insider trading cases. When they happen in options they are often pretty obvious unless the market is moving with real momentum the same way, and even then, option sellers will report you if they think it is suspicious. (By obvious, I mean, regulators should start asking questions - of course there can be a multitude of reasons.)The difference here is that absolutely NO ONE on any side of politics seems to think the SEC &amp; DOJ will pursue these.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661680</guid></item><item><title>11.

I don’t have cable anymore but I remember fond memories of cycling through channels as a child.I set up a food channel that would cycle through Masterchef and a few travel cooking shows, one for anime and one for Bollywood movies.It was incredibly enjoyable. I could just put on a channel after work without having to consciously make a decision on what to watch. Just watch whatever’s on the channel and switch over to something else if it didn’t click!Definitely going to try this out on my NAS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you have the channels, the next step is to pick up a few old RF modulators and run your own cable TV network at home. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7m7OW2xrJE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm backing up my Youtube favorites locally since 2018, so far 10k videos.

While a universal tariff with no exceptions incentivizes domestic manufacturing, a selective tariff with specific industry exceptions is absolute poison.You might think, as the authors of this exemption did, “well then we will exempt computer parts.” Then people will simply import the parts. But if you manufacture those parts in the US, you are suddenly at a massive disadvantage. Your computer parts factory likely runs using a large amount of imported raw materials, imported machines, and imported tooling, and there are no tariff exemptions for those broad categories… so you’re screwed. Oftentimes there is no reasonable domestic substitute. You will go out of business in favor of someone importing the parts, which now happens tariff-free under an exemption. That’s why, generally speaking, tariff exemptions are deadly to domestic manufacturing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43664121</guid></item><item><title>13.

He maintains a bunch of nice Emacs packages and themes.But maybe even more remarkable: he got kicked out of his flat in Greece, couldn't afford a new place, bought a small plot of land in the mountains and started building a hut from materials he was able to afford or from things neighbours gave him. Really the bare minimum (he often sat in his hut with a jacket in winter cause it wasn't well isolated/heated)Absolutely inspiration, all documented on his YouTube channel https://youtube.com/@protesilaos?si=MnjV7MhKtsT5RDSM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the good things to happen in emacs was the inclusion of `seq.el`. It makes easy functional operation over sequences, so no longer need `dash.el` or `cl-lib.el`. (dash still has many more functions inspired by clojure which is awesome when you need them)But I still wish the emacs community could adopt a modern data structure library. It's difficult to consolidate usage of sequences (lists/vectors) with alists and plists. This would make it so much more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Prot writes something I try to make place to read it. He's a very nice person and also inspiring, he's living following his values and is very insightful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665046</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ArkType is a really interesting library that has a difficult time marketing itself. More than being a schema validator, it brings TS types into the runtime, so you can programmatically work with types as data with (near?) full fidelity.I've been evaluating schema libraries for a better-than-Zod source of truth, and ArkType is where I've been focused. Zod v4 just entered beta[1], and it improves many of my problems with it. For such a mature library to improve like this, v4 is treat and speaks volumes to the quality of engineering. But ArkType has a much larger scope, and feels to me more like a data modeling language than a library. Something I definitely want as a dev!The main downside I see is that its runtime code size footprint is much larger than Zod. For some frontends this may be acceptable, but it's a real cost that isn't wise to pay in many cases. The good news is with precompilation[2] I think ArkType will come into its own and look more like a language with a compiler, and be suitable for lightweight frontends too.[1] https://v4.zod.dev/v4[2] https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/810&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ArkType looks anything but ergonomic to me. Typescript in strings? Double level type encoding?It’s a miracle it can be 100x faster than Zod, but speed was never my issue with zod to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;V4 of zod landed recently and it promises better perf https://v4.zod.dev/v4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665540</guid></item><item><title>15.

It's like the famous project management tree story: https://pmac-agpc.ca/project-management-tree-swing-storyIf anything, LLMs have surprised at much better they are than humans in understanding instructions for text based activities.  But they are MUCH worse than humans when it comes to creating images/videos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, but like.If you do have that skill to communicate clearly and describe the requirements of a novel problem, why is the AI still useful? Actually writing the code should be relatively trivial from there. If it isn't, that points to a problem with your tools/architecture/etc. Programmers IMX are, on average, far too tolerant of boilerplate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I bought those expensive knives. Why doesn't my cooking taste better?""I picked up an extraordinary violin once. It sounded awful!"There's an art here. Managerial genius is recognizing everyone's strengths and weaknesses, and maximizing impact. Coding with AI is no different.Of course I have to understand the code well enough to have written it. Usually much of the time is spent proposing improvements.I'm a few months in, learning to code with AI for my math research. After a career as a professor, I'm not sure I could explain to anyone what I'm starting to get right, but I'm working several times more efficiently than I ever could by hand.Some people will get the hang of this faster than others, and it's bull to think this can be taught.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658794</guid></item><item><title>16.

A lot of Roam users are still using it even though the pricing hasn't changed a bit and neither has the design, but I don't think there's anything better even now. Zettelkasten is severely underrated and misunderstood. Notion and Evernote are disgusting, and PARA is a nonsensical grift. If you need more context regarding that, I recommend reading Conor's Twitter threads and watching interviews and livestreams featuring him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I initially thought it was related to https://memex.garden/ but it seems not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667061</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed. Windows Server 2000 through Windows 7 were peak Microsoft operating system.By Windows 2000 Server, they finally had the architecture right, and had flushed out most of the 16 bit legacy.The big win with Windows 7 was that they finally figured out how to make it stop crashing. There were two big fixes. First, the Static Driver Verifier. This verified that kernel drivers couldn't crash the rest of the kernel. First large scale application of proof of correctness technology.  Drivers could still fail, but not overwrite other parts of the kernel. This put a huge dent into driver-induced crashes.Second was a dump classifier. Early machine learning. When the system crashed, a dump was sent to Microsoft. The classifier tried to bring similar dumps together, so one developer got a big collection of similar crashes. When you have hundreds of dumps of the same bug, locating the bug gets much easier.Between both of those, the Blue Screen of Death mostly disappeared.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A modern reimagining of Windows 2000's UI - professional, simple, uncluttered, focused, no cheapening of the whole experience with adverts in a thinly-veiled attempt to funnel you into Bing - with modern underpinnings and features such as WSL2 would have me running back towards Microsoft with open arms and cheque book in hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are my gripes with the modern Windows experience:- Runs Windows update and reboots without my permission- Keeps trying to make me switch to Bing- Keeps trying to make me use Microsoft Account vs. local account- Does a crappy job of reopening windows on reboot. Miserable copy of macOS.- Fan spinning on my laptop with no easy way to figure out what process is consuming CPU- Flat UI- No built-in way to view markdown files- No tool to graphically show where my diskspace went; allowing me to find and delete large files- Printers keep getting disconnected; it is easier to print from iPhone thanks to bonjour- No dictionary app (macOS has it)- Can't airdrop to iPhone (3rd party apps can do it)- No screenshot tool that allows you to type text (in addition to circling and highlighting and arrows)- No command-line zip / unzip- No instant search (macOS has had it for how many years now?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653421</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the remarkable strength of a Prince Rupert's Drop, a glass object formed by rapidly cooling molten glass, resulting in a teardrop shape. It delves into the unique internal stresses created during the cooling process, which give the drop its incredible resistance to external forces. While the tip can withstand significant pressure, it also highlights the fragility of the drop’s tail; when this part is broken, the entire structure violently shatters due to the release of internal stress. The piece emphasizes the drop's applications in materials science and how it serves as a fascinating example of the principles of stress and material strength.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before discussions go into some generic direction about the field. This is a huge feasibility study contain different aspects done by hundreds of people. People who are mostly interested about the physics case of FCC should read/skim at least through the first volume [1], second chapter (Specificities of the FCC physics case) the first four sections. This is about 35 pages with somehow accessible language to people with some physics knowledge.Personally I'm interested in their proposal about how they are going to approach software (Section 8). They plan to provide experiment agnostic and unified framework that is actually unified and user accessible. The field really need something like that, it is usually the pain point of most junior graduate student. The field suck at documentation and keep coherent software and write code in a bad way most of the time. I think they can have much better framework than Fermilab's art [2].[1] https://cds.cern.ch/record/2928193[2] https://art.fnal.gov/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This makes me think of The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), I remember a scientist working there in an interview right after the first discovery telling the reporter how back in the day he was dissuaded by his teacher to go into the field because "there's nothing there, it's not a serious field of research" or something along those lines.Maybe a bigger collider is exactly what we need, and if it fails that's also useful as a confirmation to go in other directions. To build it right now instead of other things is the difficult question because that's politics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't feel ambitious enough to me. Spend 10s of billions to get a less than 10x energy about 40 years after LHC reached its peak.  Also planning of the next one should have happened while the last one was being commissioned to avoid the huge gap between them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632828</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking for and finding bugs and security issues with SAP can consume your time 24/7.When left a fortune 500 company 2 years ago, many SAP processes were running in background on UN*X with these arguments:-u USERID -p PWAs a developer I informed the admins a couple of times over the years, the response was "wow, will check it out".  But they ran into a mountain of red tape and gave up.  So nothing was ever done.But as a developer and support person, at least I had a way to fix things without  falling into the bureaucracy quicksand.  FWIW, I only had to do that twice over a 10 year period around Q/E.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a number of reasons why the reporting process for bugs needs a blackout window.Just because a security researcher can discover things about a program that its own developers missed, doesn’t mean they’ve understood the entire picture. If you find one bug, you need to spend time making sure that it doesn’t represent an entire class of bugs. Once the advisory is announced, that’s blood in the water that will attract other predators. Only idiots and tourism companies chum the water before they expect more people to go into it.Back when PHP was objectively awful, I joined the pitchforks and torches mob based on the litany of CERT advisories against it. I had an argument with a coworker about whether PHP was irresponsible to use, and the very next day someone defaced the phpBB instance he maintained because of an unpatched injection attack. I pointedly did not comment because 1) smug and 2) the timing made me nervous of being accused of having been the perpetrator.But I did look at the patch that either just came out or that he missed, and was frustrated to find that the same pattern they fixed existed in two other functions.I really think that it says more about a community, not in what mistakes they make, but how they learn from those mistakes. And I’d like to say it seems like SAP didn’t, but we all know what a beast that thing is. How many tens of millions of lines of code is that thing now? The chances that a person made a mistake and two people they’ve never met copied it are essentially 0.99 repeating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43634408</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We stuck with Yup and ignored Joi, Zod and god knows what else has come down the pipeline since. Rather than wasting time upgrading, we've instead built useful features.That said, we are slowly phasing out our React frontend for one of our apps page by page and replacing it with what we use over the rest of apps: Phoenix + Liveview. The changeset system for validations has proven itself time and time again to both be fast but also to handle many of the curly validation problems we might have. It also has barely changed since its release.If you have a disciplined frontend team then you might be able to make it work. They have to be able to ignore the latest shiny thing that has come along, but if you don't then you'll have a team that is busy constantly upgrading to the latest shiny library rather than getting anything done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I only use Zod in a single library, so my experience with it is pretty minimal. One thing I have really enjoyed with it is the low maintenance.So, when I saw this post and read the first few paragraphs, I was filled with dread for having to do yet another major dependency update. Reading of all the improvements- surly the ‘breaking changes’ list must be massive.Having read the full article, it seems like the breaking changes have been kept within reason. One major improvement that stands out to me is the improved Recursive types support, but there is certainly any number of improvements for others to be excited about.The thing I enjoyed most is that excitement of the Arthur really shines throughout the whole article. I’m so thankful this library exists and is being lovingly maintained by someone who is genuinely interested in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zod is installed in nearly every project I use. It’s an essential part of my toolkit. I adore this library. It near perfect as-is and these additions make it even better. Thanks for all the hard work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667925</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and implementation of a new shader language for Rust, specifically targeting the GPU. It highlights the integration of this language with existing Rust tooling, enabling users to create and experiment with visual effects akin to those found in shader programming environments like Shadertoy. The blog emphasizes the ease of use, performance. and safety that the Rust programming language brings to GPU programming, encouraging developers to explore and contribute to the growing ecosystem of shader development using Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've spent a little time in this space, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to write shaders in Rust, although it's probably better than GLSL or WGSL.Let me start with the pros:1. Don't have to learn 2 different languages2. Modules, crates, and the easier ability to share code3. Easier sharing between rust structs and shader code.Now the cons, in comparison to Slang [1]1. No autodiff mode
2. Strictly outputs SPIR-V, while Slang can do CPU, CUDA, Pytorch, Optix, and all the major graphics APIs3. Less support - Slang is supported by the Khronos group, and Slang gets use at Nvidia, EA, and Valve.4. Safety isn't very valuable, most GPU code does not use pointers (it's so rare it's considered a feature by Slang!)5. slangc probably runs a lot faster than rustc (although I would like to see a benchmark.)6. Worse debugging experience, slang has better interop with things like NSight Graphics, and their Shader Debugger. Slang recently got support in NSight graphics for shader profiling, for example.7. Slang has support for reflection, and has a C++ api to directly output a JSON file that contains all the reflected aspects.This makes handling the movement between rust &lt;-&gt; gpu much easier. Also, the example shown on the website uses `bytemuck`, but `bytemuck` won't take into consideration the struct alignment rules[2] when using WebGPU. Instead, you have to use a crate like `encase`[3] to handle that. I'm not sure given the example on the website how it would work with WebGPU.8. If you have pre-existing shaders in GLSL or HLSL, you can use slangc directly on them. No need to rewrite.9. In reality, you may not have to learn 2 languages but you have to learn 2 different compute models (CPU vs GPU). This is actually a much harder issue, and AFAICT it is impossible to overcome with a different language. The problem is the programmer needs to understand how the platforms are different.[1] https://shader-slang.org/

[3] https://github.com/teoxoy/encase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone have recommendations for resources for learning to write shaders?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is big news. Shaders have been a pain to develop for in Unity. If I can program them in Rust, leveraging Rust's tooling and ecosystem, that would be huge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667693</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits and enjoyment of learning assembly language programming. It emphasizes how mastering assembly can enhance understanding of computer systems and improve skills in higher-level programming languages. The author shares personal experiences and insights, suggesting that engaging with assembly can be both fun and profitable, especially for those interested in computer architecture and low-level programming. Additionally, the article encourages readers to explore various resources and communities to deepen their knowledge and skills in assembly language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question of which assembly is best to learn is of course incredibly subjective, but I think the author gives short shrift to ARM32. It is historically important (especially for the Acorn computers, most popular in the UK), sensibly designed, and still relevant today, just in the context of microcontrollers.Some of the most fun I've had programming assembly has been writing HDMI video scanout kernels for a RP2040 chip[1]. It was a delightful puzzle how to make every single cycle count. It is a great sense of satisfaction of using every one of the 8 "low" registers (the other 8 "high" registers generally take one more cycle to move into a low register, but there are exceptions such as add and compare where they can be free; thus you almost always use a high register for the loop termination comparison). Most satisfying, you can cycle-count and predict the performance very accurately, which is not at all true on modern 64 bit processors. These video kernels could not be written in Rust or C with anywhere near the same performance. Also, in general, Rust compiles to pretty verbose code, which matters a lot when you have limited memory.Ironically, the reasons for this project being on hold also point to the downside of assembler: since then, the RP2350 chip has come out, and huge parts of the project would need to be rewritten (though it would be much, much more capable than the first version).[1]: https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/pico-dvi-rs/blob/main/src/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess the comparison here is mainly for fun and food for thought, but I think the answer is that it depends on your use case. If there's a system that you are enthusiastic about and want to be able to develop code for, then that is probably what you should pick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm still learning assembly for fun.Many years ago: x86 for reverse engineering. 
Nowadays: bootable games (https://github.com/nanochess is an excellent treasure trove) and classic game consoles (GBA, SNES) etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644534</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of the "Sphere" project by Google Cloud, which utilizes a "Wizard of Oz" technique to improve user interaction with generative AI tools. It focuses on creating more human-like and empathetic responses from AI by integrating a structured approach that enhances the capabilities of AI in various applications. The aim is to elevate user experiences by providing intuitive, conversational interfaces that adapt to users’ needs while maintaining a consistent and effective delivery of information through AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Take the moment where the Cowardly Lion first pounces on his soon-to-be companions. The camera pans back and forth between the Scarecrow and Tin Man, with cuts to Dorothy hiding behind a tree in the distance. The experience at Sphere called for keeping all these elements together, in hyper-realistic detail.This sounds awful, as if Google thinks direction and editing are technological limitations rather than artistic choices. This entire project seems fit for a culture that loves content and hates art. If these tasteless jokers ever do this to Stalker I will probably riot. (“Carefully composed shots is for anachronistic dweebs, our society demands an Experience Like No Other.”)&gt; Every change, Hays notes, was made in close collaboration with Warner Bros., to ensure continuity with the spirit of the original.Considering Warner Bros. Discovery’s track record is 3 years of selling out their own directors and writers, I would be more confident if Google were left to their own devices! DeepMind likely has more respect for the film than Warner Bros. management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They showed a bit of this with a high production video of “how we did it” on Tuesday. The outpainting was amazing, details looked crisp, physics sim was pretty good, and the continuity for actors was good. The amount of tech they had to create and manage for the project is remarkable on its own.There were some perspective and lighting issues, and a few small glitchy artifact moments. They probably showed about 5 minutes of footage from various parts of the movie.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is kind of strange to me because it implies celluloid film is low quality, but it seems there’s a rough consensus that you can  can scan that size of film in to create good 4K video, if not higher. That’s not enough for the Sphere’s full 16K resolution, but that’s more to do with it having extremely high resolution than the film being “tiny” or grainy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631931</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the YakRead algorithm discusses its purpose in optimizing the efficiency of video streaming experiences by prioritizing content loading based on user engagement. It outlines the algorithm's structure, including its use of machine learning to predict user behavior and adjust content delivery dynamically. The article provides a detailed breakdown of the algorithm's components and emphasizes its potential to enhance user satisfaction by reducing buffering times and improving overall content accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun to see this on the front page! I worked on Yakread full time for about 8 months as an attempted startup, after a few years of other recommender system startup ideas. Now it's a side project that I develop on the weekends after my kids fall asleep, aided by caffeine (me, not the kids). I'm in the middle of open-sourcing/rewriting it. Hopefully will be done in a couple months? Then I can finally get back to adding new features. I talked about some potential ones in my previous post: https://obryant.dev/p/rewriting-yakread/also I guess a link to the actual app wouldn't hurt: https://yakread.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hm, I was curious about the biased shuffle, since I was not expecting that particular shape.It looks like we basically build up the list of bookmarks as follows [0]:    x = rand()
    if x &lt; p:
      element = first element
    else:
      element = random element
    return [element] + shuffle(rest of list, according to the original order)

In some sense, it's reminiscent of selection sort. Any particular reason for choosing this approach? One "obvious" downside is that this ends up being an O(n*k) algorithm because you end up building a new list each iteration. It's also harder for me to intuitively understand how shuffled the list is based on the parameter, other than at the two extremes.[0] https://github.com/jacobobryant/yakread/blob/bff756c68d86a07...I'm also curious about the interleaving approach described in the last section:&gt; If you’ve already scrolled past all your unread bookmarked items several times but you have a bunch of new subscription items, we should probably lean towards recommending the subscription items.&gt; I do this by comparing the two lists pairwise and selecting an item via weighted random choice based on how many times they’ve been previously skipped (i.e. scrolled past in the For You feed). e.g. if the first bookmark item has been skipped twice and the first subscription item has been skipped once, then there’ll be a 40% chance we select the subscription item and a 60% chance we select the bookmark item.I thought we wanted to prefer the item that hadn't been skipped as many times (so, prefer the subscription item)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you for sharing. I was hoping you'd eventually publish an article on Yakread's ranking model, I remember you mentioning it tangentially in one of your talks.Love how concise the code is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43626108</guid></item><item><title>30.

But somewhat surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s pretty interesting how Amiga and Atari ST followed Macintosh down a bad path of having large amounts of the OS in ROM, which may have made some sense when a single few-hundred-kilobyte floppy was the only storage most users would have, but made a lot less sense just a few years later when the ROM OS needed lots of patches and everyone had some sort of fixed disk to boot from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome - not only is it a ROM replacement but it can be programmed by the Amiga itselfIt also has a feature where you can exchange files with a pc connected via USB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43666341</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO you don’t need to build a full app or company. You could just build a series of niche sites or properties. If your code solves a specific pain point really well, wrap it in a simple front end or paid API and let people use it.Some possible ideas:Micro SaaS: Turn it into a one-page tool (log parser, file cleaner, PDF transformer) with Stripe and add rate limits. People pay for simplicity.Paid API: Use RapidAPI or Plain.com to expose it. Charge per hit or via metered billing. Maybe even a slackbot for some of these would make sense.Productized utility: Sell it as a $49/month “done-for-you” service to whatever niche audience would benefit (dev teams, SEO people, lawyers, etc).Digital bundle: If it’s CLI or script-based, package it up with a guide or demo on YouTube and sell on Gumroad.You’re not necessarily building a startup, and that’s fine! just something useful enough for strangers to pay for which is more than enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others have some great suggestions here, but my advice is - don't.I don't mean this negatively, but your focus seems to be wanting to share cool shit you've done.  a successful business sells a solution to a problem, and sometimes to solve the problem you actually sacrifice the cool shit ans just build boring code you've built 100 times before.If you're super keen, pick a problen to solve and build a conpany. Open source all the above code on github and use it as a funnel with links back to your new company site. Then you can share the cool shit, no matter subgenre it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I created a niche CLI tool to clean messy CSVs. It was too small for a startup, so I made a simple landing page. Then, I shared it in forums and added a 'buy me a coffee' link. To my surprise, it brought in small but steady income. You can also bundle tools into a digital product (like a 'developer toolkit') and sell on Gumroad. APIs and microservices on RapidAPI or GitHub Sponsors also work if your tool solves a real pain point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667887</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The document is a historical catalog from Ames Manufacturing Company, dated 1926, showcasing a range of products, particularly tools and hardware. It provides detailed descriptions, specifications, and images of various items such as agricultural tools, hand tools, and cutlery, aimed at helping customers select the right products. The catalog serves as a valuable resource for understanding the craftsmanship and offerings of Ames in that era, reflecting the manufacturing trends and consumer needs of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640345"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The catalog is a reminder of a time when the prime motive power for moving material was a human.  Thus, the large number of different shovels(for different materials and situations,) with a human interface (i.e., the handle.)  
Ames was just one of many firms making shovels. Often these were local to a region since transportation costs added excessive costs (unless the target market had no competing shovel makers, say on the frontier.)
The same situation exists for the ax.  Look up "vintage ax brands."  At one time there were many ax makers, mostly regional, because the ax was still a common tool for shaping wood, again, with the motive power being a human.In modern times most of this type of work is done by a machine.  Possibly human run but a machine so trench digger, auger, backhoe, etc..  (or with the ax, a sawsall, circular saw, chainsaw, etc..) With the result being there are a few shovels for sale in, say, Home Depot, most made in China, and, although most construction companies and landscapers have some shovels they're mostly for situations where a machine can't reach or can't do a fine enough job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit of a nerd for hand tools and I've the same book for axes, and another for hand files lying around somewhere. Around this time these tool companies had a huge array of designs for their tools. It seems like almost every region of America had their own pattern of ax head with a range of sizes to choose from, and their own preference for style of handle, of which there are probably more than you'd expect, and users had their own preference for the style of cutting edge too. You had axes for just about any type of wood cutting job you can imagine. The land was conquered by these tools and the people using them put a lot of care and consideration into them, and it showed.Nowadays, you still have some regional patterns available, but they're almost all swamp axes (a general purpose axe, not good at any one thing -- the head is too thick for very effective falling, but too thin for very effective splitting). You could thin them out, but filing the cheeks down messes up the temper of the steel. Handles have about two styles to pick from, and they all come clearcoated, which is awful on your hands, unlike linseed oil. Sure you can go boutique, like Gransfors of Hult Bruk, or Tuatahi, but you're looking at spending hundreds, which may actually be more in line with what you would have been spending for a quality tool 100 years ago, if you adjust for inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN sees AWS as the source for the PDF, but it's more accurate to cite the Alfred B. Tofias Archive at Stonehill College from which the PDF is linked.https://www.stonehill.edu/offices-and-services/archives/indu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640345</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People have made the point many times before, that “hallucination” is mainly what generative AI does and not the exception, but most of the time it’s a useful hallucination.I describe it as more of a “mashup”, like an interpolation of statistically related output that was in the training data.The thinking was in the minds of the people that created the tons of content used for training, and from the view of information theory there is enough redundancy in the content to recover much of the intent statistically. But some intent is harder to extract just from example content.So when generating statically similar output, the statistical model can miss the hidden rules that were a part of the thinking that went into the content that was used for training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who solely code and are not good software architects will try and fail to delegate coding to LLM.What we are doing in practice when delegating coding to LLMs is climbing up the abstraction level ladder.We can compensate bad software architecture because we understand deeply the code details and make indirect couplings in the code. When we don't understand deeply the code, we need to compensate it with good architecture.That means thinking about code in terms of interfaces, stores, procedures, behaviours, actors, permissions and competences (what the actors should do, how they should behave and the scope of action they should be limited to).Then these details should reflect directly in the prompts. See how hard it is to make this process agentic, because you need user input in the agent inner workings.And after running these prompts and with luck successfully extracting functioning components, you are the one that should be putting these components together to make working system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a real problem, and AI is a new vector for it, but the root cause is the lack of reliable trust and security around packages in general.I really wonder what the solution is.Has there been any work on limiting the permissions of modules? E.g. by default a third-party module can't access disk or network or various system calls or shell functions or use tools like Python's "inspect" to access data outside what is passed to them? Unless you explicitly pass permissions in your import statement or something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43663777</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 20 or so years ago, I have come across a configuration pattern that could be arguably called "Level 0".  It was configuration by file existence.  The file itself would be typically empty.  So no parsing, syntax, or schema involved.  For example, if the file /opt/foo/foo.txt exists, the software does one thing but if it is missing the software does another thing.  So effectively, the existence of the file serves as a boolean configuration flag.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"vibeconfig"1. You give LLM the requirements2. It spits out whatever monstrosity is required to configure the software or service in question3. When issues later arise, you just vibeconfig again with new requirementsEventually new vibeconfig tools will rise because even those three steps are not complex enough. These call LLM APIs to inject the config files dynamically at runtime. "But it's a security issue". So another vertical is born: auditing and securing the vibeconfig LLM autogeneration toolsets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d argue Terraform/HCL is quite popular as a Level 4 configuration language. My biggest issue with it is that once things get sufficiently complex, you wish you were using a Level 5 language.In fact, it’s hard to see where a Level 4 language perfectly fits. After you’ve surpassed the abilities of JSON or YAML (and you don’t opt for slapping on a templating engine like Helm does), it feels like jumping straight to Level 5 is worth the effort for the tooling and larger community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667494</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research findings on the nature of delusions, suggesting that the themes of delusions may be more diverse than previously understood. It emphasizes the complexity of delusions by detailing various themes observed in individuals, which can include paranoia, grandiosity, and obsession. The study encourages a broader perspective on delusional content, highlighting the need for further exploration into how these themes are formed and expressed in different individuals, ultimately aiming to improve the understanding and treatment of delusional disorders in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "terror of global catastrophe" is what doomscroller media constantly hammers onto its readers. And once someone has "bought in", it's impossible to reason with them. They'll just forever spread anxiety around them.What's interesting is how it happens. Take someone who is mentally stable and subject them to a terminally online lifestyle for a year or two. They will have tons of anxiety about all sorts of things, not the least of which will be that the world is doomed (with no hope), that our societies and way of life are in the "late stage" and moments from collapse, and so on.And it's a bit of a tragedy. If we took only the energy that people spend evangelizing those doom beliefs and put that energy into productive efforts, that alone could probably prevent whatever disaster is being evangelized. But maybe that'd not be good for engagement on social media or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper doesn't seem to actually define their categories anywhere. Am I just missing it? Or am I meant to intuitively know the difference between "spied on / watched" and "spy / surveillance"?Edit - upon re-reading, it seems like they're just using the themes present in the underlying literature, with _extremely_ conservative merging. Which makes the headline claim, that there are 37 distinct themes, pretty pointless. Is "spied on" really a distinct theme from "surveillance"? More likely, there's just no standardised name for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no one told me about this being about schizophrenia, I would interpret Figure 3 as a categorization of american movies and series.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43641649</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the theoretical concept of "paraparticles," a type of quantum particle that could exist alongside fermions and bosons, potentially forming a third category in the realm of quantum physics. Paraparticles are characterized by their unique statistics, which would differ from those of traditional particles, and they could have significant implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics, particularly in fields like condensed matter physics. Researchers are exploring the theoretical foundations and possible physical realizations of paraparticles, aiming to discover how they could reshape our knowledge of particle interactions and quantum states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of electrical transformers in the context of modernizing power grids, focusing on the shift towards solid-state transformers (SSTs). It highlights the advantages of SSTs over traditional transformers, including improved efficiency, enhanced control over power flow, and the ability to integrate renewable energy sources more effectively. The piece emphasizes the importance of innovation in transformer technology to meet the demands of smarter and more flexible grids that can support the transition to sustainable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

What exactly happens at the isolation stage. They say it includes a high frequency transformer (HFT). But its input and out put is DC. And classic transformers operate on AC. So in order to get the transformer working, one would have to chop up the incoming dc power into a square wave or a sine wave. But what transistors can you use to do this, considering you are dealing both with very high power and very high frequencies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ex-tesla Drew Baglino is starting a new company Heron for solid state transformersOf topic - dealing with medium voltage e.g. 6kv-10kv - are there existing be-spoke solid-state solutions?e.g. PV/battery 400V converted to 6kv without inverter/transformer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43666778</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential repercussions of societal and environmental issues projected to unfold by 2025, emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate change, political discontent, and economic instability. It highlights the interconnectedness of these problems and warns of a dire future if proactive measures are not taken. The author calls for collective action and awareness to mitigate these challenges and foster a more sustainable and equitable world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A question that came up in discussions recently and that I found interesting: How will new APIs, libraries or tooling be introduced in the future?The models all have their specific innate knowledge of the programming ecosystem from the point in time where their last training data was collected. However, unlike humans, they cannot update that knowledge unless a new finetuning is performed - and even then, they can only learn about new libraries that are already in widespread use.So if everyone now shifts to Vibe Coding, will this now mean that software ecosystems effectively become frozen? New libraries cannot gain popularity because AIs won't use them in code and AIs won't start to use them because they aren't popular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As far as hobby projects are concerned, I'd agree: A bit more "thinking like your boss" could be helpful. You can now focus more on the things you want your project be able to do instead of the specific details of its code structure. (In the end, nothing keeps you from still manually writing/editing parts of the code if you want some things specifically done in a certain way. There are also projects where the code structure legitimately is the feature, I.e. if you want to explore some new style of API or architecture design for its own sake)The one part that I believe will still be essenty is understanding the code. It's one one thing to use Claude as a (self-driving) car, where you delegate the actual driving, but still understand the roads being taken. (Both for learning and for validating if the route is in fact correct)It's another thing to treat it like a teleporter, where you tell it a destination and then are magically beamed to a location that sort of looks like that destination, with no way to understand how you got there or if this is really the right place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is doing the math the wrong way. For an extra $5/day, a 3rd world country can now pay an engineer $20/day to do the job of a junior engineer in a 1st world one.The bitter lesson is going to be for junior engineers who see less job offers and don’t see consulting power houses eat their lunch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43662686</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the hidden issues that can undermine a seemingly harmonious team, emphasizing that a lack of constructive conflict and open communication can lead to groupthink and stagnation. It argues that while teams may appear united, the absence of diverse viewpoints and healthy debate may hinder innovation and problem-solving. The author encourages leaders to foster an environment where team members feel safe to express dissenting opinions and engage in productive disagreements, ultimately promoting growth and success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One counter to this over 20 years in this game is there are plenty of people who confuse "having heated discussions" with being high functioning.That is - I've been on lots of low functioning teams riven with conflict.  Prima donna developers who publicly call managers/teammates stupid in meetings.  Managers giving negative feedback in public instead of in private.  Stubborn veteran team members telling newer team members to get a new job if they don't like how things are done.One pattern I've seen in lower functioning teams with lots of conflict is some members being very well spoken, typically more classically trained like a philosophy background, probably a past debate club type kid.  "Strong opinions, loosely held" type behavior where bad ideas were passionately argued by the more eloquent &amp; aggressive team member until everyone else was exhausted and just let it run.The kind of guys that would steamroll the rest of the team as a bunch of idiots for not agreeing with him, but flip to a charismatic "ah good point" when incontrovertible proof of their idea not being correct was presented.  The problem is you can't provide incontrovertible proof in real time in most cases, and lots of managers confuse their passion/certitude for correctness.So high functioning teams can have heated arguments &amp; difficult people, but heated arguments do not in themselves lead to high functioning teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran a pretty high-functioning team of experienced C++ image processing pipeline programmers, for 25 years. We were part of a much larger, international (and interdisciplinary) team. We worked for one of the most renowned imaging companies in the world.Some of the folks we dealt with, were the top people in their field, and not everyone was especially good at getting along with others.Everyone thought they had The Answer, and everyone was totally passionate about doing their best work.Needless to say, we often had heated discussions.For the most part, we did excellent work (not always, but team infighting was not the reason for issues).My personal experience, is that creative, passionate, high-talent teams can be pretty messy, and managing them, is tricky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this article confuses an absence of "heated arguments" with a lack of constructive, critical discussions. I've found that in mature teams with high trust, people don't have heated arguments precisely because they are not afraid that their voices will be ignored. There is no need to become heated because you trust that the other people on the team will hear you out and consider your viewpoint.&gt;code that nobody questions usually crashes in productionI don't understand what that means.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661763</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Cursor, with Claude 3.7 and Gemini. But Claude Code is an absolut biest and blows them out the water. It is expensive, but it acts like a senior developer. It fixes bugs where Cursor (no matter which model) fails to do so, no matter which model.I tried Roo with OpenRouter, selected DeepSeek R1, as that was supposed to have the largest output token. Asked Roo to create a documentation for a project I worked on. It created a page of markdown with a few mermaid diagrams. Next I asked Claude Code to do the same. With the same prompt. It created several markdown files with half a dozen mermaid diagrams describing the tech stack, the architecture, the data model and so much more. Another level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aider is working for me, but it’s a simple tool. Am I going to experience real benefits from switching to Roo, Cline, or Kilo?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you all do wrong; you should focus on focused LLMs like JetBrains does.

&lt;p&gt;The article from ProPublica discusses a lawsuit against Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, highlighting how the insurance company denied coverage for a breast cancer treatment recommended by doctors. The piece emphasizes the struggles faced by patients, particularly the case of a woman whose treatment was deemed "experimental" despite her doctors' support. It also sheds light on the broader issue of insurance companies' practices in approving or denying care, potentially putting patients' health at risk and raising questions about accountability and the impact of profit-driven decisions in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “not a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, in a deposition. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.&gt; At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” acknowledged Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.&gt; On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish more people were asking “why does the hospital charge such absurdly high fees?” instead of “why is Blue Cross trying to not pay those absurdly high fees?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow great timing, I just got a $22,000 bill 2 hours ago for a surgery that UHC approved 2 months ago (in a written letter from them) because they refused to pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43664660</guid></item><item><title>46.

Its bad enough I get ads for games in the notification area in Win10 -- even though I have it all disabled through group policy.Looks like this finally is the year of the Linux Desktop!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It appears this will be an opt in feature.Honestly it will probably help some people "hey where did I put that file?" but yes at a tremendous cost to privacy and security for those who use it.I am also weary that it is opt in "for now".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did we get here? A 20-year lifelog.2003, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog&gt;The objective of the LifeLog concept was "to be able to trace the 'threads' of an individual's life in terms of events, states, and relationships", and it has the ability to "take in all of a subject's experience, from phone numbers dialed and e-mail messages viewed to every breath taken, step made and place gone".2007 Microsoft Research, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/the-microsoft...&gt; The SenseCam is a personal, wearable camera developed by Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, and used as a lifelogging device in projects like MyLifeBits.. based on wearing the SenseCam for lifelogging of ‘events’ during your day, and generating a fast-forward movie of the event as the memory recall interface.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/mylifebits/ &amp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyLifeBits&gt; MyLifeBits is a life-logging experiment begun in 2001. It is a Microsoft Research project inspired by Vannevar Bush's hypothetical Memex computer system.. The "experimental subject" of the project is computer scientist Gordon Bell.. For this, Bell has digitized all documents he has read or produced, CDs, emails, and so on. He continues to do so, gathering web pages browsed, phone and instant messaging conversations and the like more or less automatically. The book Total Recall describes the vision and implications for a personal, lifetime e-memory for recall, work, health, education, and immortality.Lifelogging has been referenced by 10,000+ academic papers over two decades, https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=lifelogging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43660914</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the capabilities of using Rust, a systems programming language, to enhance Python's performance through the PyO3 library and other tools. It highlights how Rust's speed and efficiency can be leveraged to optimize Python code, allowing developers to write Python applications that run at near-native speed. The piece also covers practical examples, including benchmarks and real-world applications where Rust has been integrated with Python to improve execution times and overall performance. Ultimately, it emphasizes the potential of combining these two languages to harness Rust's strengths while maintaining Python's ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But what if we could compile Python into raw native code?Am I missing something or has that been possible for at least 20 years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused about the introduction mentioning API keys? The function is compiled on and/or uploaded to your servers?The introduction could benefit from discussing a less toyish problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that the compilation flags utilized are needed in order to properly justify the validity of the microbenchmark here.At opt-level 2 and 3 rust completely optimizes away the interior loop, leaving just two instructions (plus a check for if n=0). given that your graph isnt showing O(1) time complexity shows you either1) didn't compile your rust code in release mode for benchmarking, as the release profile uses opt-level=3
or
2) intentionally downgraded the opt-level of the release profile in order to run these testsI'd be interested to see a more proper example, one where the task itself has some non-zero time complexity. Show a quicksort implementation perhaps. But as it stands this is just marketing smoke and mirrors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632373</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses GrapheneOS, highlighting its commitment to privacy and security in mobile operating systems. It emphasizes the advantages of using GrapheneOS over traditional Android and iOS, such as enhanced security features, increased control over app permissions, and reduced data collection. The text encourages users to consider switching to GrapheneOS for a more private and secure mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love GrapheneOS. The biggest downside is that Google integrity API block wireless payments in Google Pay. All Dutch banks now advertise to install Google pay for wireless payments.
I've tried asking Google to support GrapheneOS but they told me to do a feature request. Which I did and got no reply to. I've contacted the consumer market authority and made a formal complaint since Google and Apple share effectively a contactless payments duopoly and decide which OS distributions get access. Those are closed source and usually bundled with a lot of spyware. I also explained how the Google integrity API might affect banking availability in the future (and already does for some banking apps). They took it very seriously and I hope to hear from them in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was bit confused why this was notable, but the Pixel 9a just released Thursday. So this is an incredibly fast turnaround for a community OS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a after Google deleted the battery life[0], and while the initial move was frustrating with things not working, I've adapted and have a nice feeling of security while using my device again. It feels like it's mine, and I don't have to worry about who will spy on me or rug-pull me next.[0] https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/113917226566692707&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669185</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses a lesser-known alternative to traditional GPS called BPS (Broadcast Positioning System), which utilizes low-frequency signals to determine location. The author highlights its potential advantages, such as improved accuracy in urban environments and reduced reliance on satellite systems, making it a promising technology for various applications in navigation and positioning. The post also emphasizes the growing interest and research in BPS as a viable option for enhancing location services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope it will still be possible to receive a BPS timing signal privately and anonymously with ATSC 3 like one can with GPS. ATSC 3 has the Dedicated Return Channel because marketers “““need””” to spy on every-fucking-thing we do: https://www.atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A323-2024-04...“Conventional linear TV services alone (albeit ultra-high-definition) may not be sufficient to sustain the terrestrial broadcasting business which requires a large amount of highly coveted spectrum resources. Intelligent media delivery and flexible service models that maximize the network Return on Investment (ROI) is of paramount importance to the broadcasting industry in the new era.”That's a lot of fancy words to say ‘we're doing this because it makes us more money’ lol“Recent studies have shown that interactivity between media customers and service providers and between users themselves will be one of the most important features in the next-generation media service. In this document, this unique opportunity is addressed by defining a Dedicated Return Channel (DRC) system for the next-generation broadcasting system.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that this blog post (and the associated video) were a quick off-the-cuff thing while I was on the NAB show floor—I have been talking to a few of those involved in the testing at NIST, Sinclair, and Avateq (among others), and will hopefully have a lot more in a follow-up.Right now it's in the experimental stage, with only 6 towers total deployed (only 5 were operational during NAB, and only one in Nevada... so timing, not navigation yet).The ultimate plan—which is probably dependent on how well ATSC 3.0 rolls out (which has plenty of hurdles[1])—is to encourage broadcasters to add on the necessary timing equipment to their transmitter sites, to build a mesh network for timing.That would allow the system to be 100% independent of GPS (time transfer could be done via dark fiber and/or ground-satellite-ground directly to some 'master' sites).The advantages for BPS are coverage (somewhat) inside buildings, the ability to have line of sight nearly everywhere in populated areas, and resilience to jamming you can't get with GPS (a 100 kW transmitter signal 10 miles away is a lot harder to defeat than a weak GPS signal hundreds of miles away in the sky).The demo on the show floor was also using eLoran to distribute time from a site in Nevada to the transmitter facility on Black Mountain outside Vegas, showing a way to be fully GPS-independent (though the current eLoran timing was sourced from GPS).[1] ATSC 3.0, as it is being rolled out in the US, doesn't even add on 4K (just 1080p HDR), and tacks on 'features' like 'show replay' (where you tap a button and an app can stream a show you're watching on OTA TV through the Internet... amazing! /s), DRM (at stations' discretion, ugh), and 'personalized ad injection' (no doubt requiring you to connect your TV to the Internet so advertisers can get your precise location too...). Because ATSC 3.0 requires new hardware, consumers have to be motivated to buy new TVs or converter boxes—I don't see anything that motivates me to do so. I feel like it may be a lot like the (forever ongoing) HD Radio rollout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-power, and ideally authenticated, alternatives to space-based GNSS are desperately needed, given the sharp uptick in jamming and spoofing incidents in many places.In a true "end of history" moment, the US and other NATO members discontinued both of their ground-based systems (which are inherently harder to jam due to their much higher transmission power, since transmitters are not power limited) – Omega in the late 1990s and Loran-C in the early 2010s – in favor of GPS, while Russia kept their equivalent functional, and China completed an eLoran network last year.Add to that the FAA's reduction of their ground-based VOR/DME station network that lets planes navigate when GPS is unavailable...GPS jamming, and much more concerningly spoofing, will probably quickly come within reach of non-nation-states and smaller groups of all kinds, and ultimately individual actors, and that can't possibly end well for civil aviation if robust countermeasures don't become available very soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669308</guid></item><item><title>3.

All this lacks is the grand finale where the misunderstanding is revealed and they kiss &amp; make out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have immense respect for PKDs writings, he was far far ahead of his time, sad that he was such a mess mentally.His themes about the malleability of reality are just so prescient about the problems of the digital era. Neighbors no longer share the same narrative about what is actually happening in the world.I often wonder what PKD would say if he were alive today. Heck, I wonder what he'd be doing today in the digital era... Imagine if he had a YouTube channel...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This plot [about an intelligent beam of light] wouldn’t be out of place in one of Dick’s mind-bending novels.This experience was, in fact, the basis of a novel he wrote called _Valis_.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43660520</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the obsession with 1980s terminals. They're even less powerful than the contemporary 8-bit home computers. It's perfectly OK to be a retro enthusiast, it's another thing to claim that this is the peak tech to power our modern CLIs, or a solid foundation for portable UIs.From the docs:    Stop thinking in standard CSS units like px, em, rem, %
    Start thinking in Character Cells for spacing, sizing, and positioning

A VT102 already has a character grid, but it needs a serial protocol to allow applications on the mainframe to talk to it. You can loop around this and use the raw mode to address individual cells.The web browser has an insanely powerful typographic and layout engine. Now we're looping back into character cells. Something went wrong here, at least once.That said, I like the aesthetic and the default color palette. It's quirky, but it has its places.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks awesome and we're fans of the TUI aesthetic at terminal trove (1) (we're biased), it's also great that WebTUI has keyboard shortcuts to go with it.Not CSS but similarly ratzilla (2) also comes to mind, that allows you to build terminal-themed web applications with Rust and WebAssembly.Check out the examples (3) they look great!(1) https://terminaltrove.com/(2) https://github.com/orhun/ratzilla(3) https://github.com/orhun/ratzilla?tab=readme-ov-file#example...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not seeing any icons (on ios, tried a few browsers).

Well it looks like it's a poorly deployed Wordpress on top of Apache, with no caching enabled, no content compression, no HTTP 2/3. It would likely be fairly easy to get this serving super cheap on a very small machine, but of course doing so requires some expertise, and expertise still isn't cheap.Sure you could ask an LLM, but they still aren't good at helping when you have no clue what to ask - if you don't even really know the site is slower than it should be, why would you even ask? You'd just hear about things getting crushed and reach for the furry defender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re confused about what this is - it’s to prevent AI scraping.&gt; Anubis uses a proof-of-work challenge to ensure that clients are using a modern browser and are able to calculate SHA-256 checksumshttps://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/design/how-anubis-worksThis is pretty cool, I have a project or two that might benefit from it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43668433</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this with the Viture Pro XR glasses last year and it sucks. Can't use it with Linux, except in dumb monitor mode. No head tracking unless you're using a supported OS. Android app sucks becaus you can't use it with any old app, eg productivity apps (their app is like a demo of head tracking that only supports stuff like YouTube and local media). Maybe I should have purchased the Xreals?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been doing this a few months now with an xreal one and minisforum um790.Same ability to power via usb-C and have other ports available.It's worked very well, the 1920x1080 resoultion of the glasses is pretty clear but I find "anchoring" the screen to be most usable because the edges do get a little blurry, but with the screen anchored you can just "look around" a little to bring them into focus.The biggest drawback is the resolution. While still very sharp and clear, it's tough going from a framework laptop 2256x1504 to 1920x1080.I'm just used to everything being a little smaller and being able to fit more info into my FoV vs having to look around a "larger" screen for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AR glasses brings great accessibility improvements, especially those who are bedridden; I wrote the need-gap for wearable low latency computer displays[1] ~6 years ago when I was in bed recovering from a spinal fusion surgery as the only option available to me were those unwieldy bed mounts for monitors and it requires help from others to adjust the angles.[1] https://needgap.com/problems/16-wearable-low-latency-display...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43668192</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex themes and darker undertones present in Tove Jansson's Moomin series, delving into the author's background and the surreal, often melancholic aspects of her storytelling. It highlights how Jansson's personal experiences and the historical context influenced her work, revealing a nuanced perspective on the seemingly whimsical world of the Moomins. The piece also discusses the balance between lightness and darkness in her narratives, demonstrating that her stories resonate with both children and adults by addressing deeper existential themes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure how tongue in cheek this was, but I assume it's serious. Either way, it's a fun and smart read.The article spots well the dark side of the moomins, but in my opinion goes too deep into it. My disagreements boil down to this: "One of the oddest aspects of the Moomin phenomenon is how these complex tales of apocalypse, breakdown and disfunction have been consistently misread as cutesy celebrations of domestic life." Yes, all these things exist, but the point to me has always been that they are cutesy despite that! The stories paint a very typical family dynamic (at least of the time, at least in a Finnish swedish speaking family like Tove's), throws it into weirdest situations, and they all survive together thanks to, and despite, their dysfunctions. And Moominmamma is the most wholesome character ever, period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I lived in Finland for a couple years. Finns, like the Moomins, are whimsical yet profound, like midsummer’s fleeting joy before the long winter. They mirror Finland’s love of nature and quiet isolation, with their cozy valley echoing the Finns forest cabins by a lake. The happy vibe hides struggles—tough winters, heavy drinking—but the Moomins’ warmth reflects the Finns’ wholesome character.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question to Swedes: what were you child impressions of "Pettson och Findus"? I read it to children as an adult, and impressions are that it tells of the funny &amp; sad sides of taking care of children, and I sympathize to Pettson, of course. I wonder how you saw it as children.On topic: interesting read. I'd never think these stories had so much dark side to them.I got all 9 stories in 3 books at the age of 11 and read most of them, and was very happy with the stories, never noticing any of the dread the article speaks about.Especially the Midwinter story was fascinating - we lived not that North, but in cold winter mid-continent, and the story was like looking out watching for the first signs of the spring, that eventually always comes, but you shouldn't celebrate any of those too early -- when day temperature comes above 0 in March, you know it's going to be freezing in the evening. (Later I was stunned with foreigners in our city complain of this March weather, call it "winter" and be depressed!)A few years ago someone on social networks posted her impressions from reading them out loud to children -- that indeed it's depressive.So I guess, the conclusion is that people make opposite meanings and moods of the same events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43672593</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The project "whenever" on GitHub is a Ruby gem designed to help developers manage and maintain cron jobs easily. It allows users to define schedules in a straightforward Ruby syntax, eliminating the need to directly edit crontab files. The functionality includes generating cron definitions from a single file and provides a clear overview of scheduled jobs. The README contains instructions for installation, usage examples, and configuration tips to streamline the process of setting up automated tasks in a Ruby environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you've not read the blog post that explains why this library exists I recommend it. It's called "Ten Python datetime pitfalls, and what libraries are (not) doing about it"https://dev.arie.bovenberg.net/blog/python-datetime-pitfalls...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah nice it solves the Liskov violation that the standard library has. In the standard library, dates can be compared with &lt;, and datetimes are dates. But compare a datetime with a date with &lt;, and you get an error. This drove me nuts at work recently.I wonder what benefits this choice has that outweigh the risks of this behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve tried Arrow, Delorean, and Pendulum, plus the stdlib datetime of course, and settled on Whenever. It fits what I actually do with datetimes better, plus it seems more actively maintained. With the others I always seem to have a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I am missing a whole load of edge cases. With Pendulum that seems more baked into the API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43671308</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the origins and significance of the small house symbol found in IBM's code page 437, which is a character set used in early computers. It discusses the historical context of graphical characters in computing, particularly in the early personal computer era, and details how the house symbol became an iconic representation in ASCII art and gaming. The author also reflects on the cultural impact of such symbols and their role in digital communication, emphasizing how they evoke nostalgia for the early days of computing.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, it is linked 8 times in this article.  If this kind of thing interests you, I highly recommend following those links.  VileR's site is probably the best resource we have today that preserves the various PC OEM fonts from a bygone technological era -- an era that lives on in the memories of those of us who first encountered these machines early in life.I'm genuinely in awe of the time and effort VileR has poured into recovering each font, and their countless variants, from a wide range of ROMs.  The site not only archives them all with incredible attention to detail, but also offers live previews, aspect ratio correction, and other thoughtful features that make exploring it a joy.  I've spent countless hours there comparing different OEM fonts, and hunting down the best ones to use in my own work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow this is a beautiful article. I love Code page 437 - my first experiences with computers used it. I made two little things that are a homage to the pixelated and "cyberpunk" "screaming electron" "information superhighway" glory that is IBM Code Page 437:1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges faced by developers in using YAML for configuration management, particularly highlighting the "Norway Problem," which refers to issues related to ambiguous syntax, data type handling, and the complexity that arises with intricate structures. It examines how these problems can lead to errors and misinterpretations in programming, advocating for better awareness and thoughtful practices when utilizing YAML. The author also suggests potential solutions and alternatives to improve YAML's usability in development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even worse is the all-decimal MAC problem.Some genius decided that, to make time input convenient, YAML would parse HH:MM:SS as SS + 60×MM + 60×60×HH. So you could enter 1:23:45 and it would give you the correct number of seconds in 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 45 seconds.They neglected to put a maximum on the number of such sexagesimal places, so if you put, say, six numbers separated by colons like this, it would be parsed as a very large integer.Imagine my surprise when, while working at a networking company, we had some devices which failed to configure their MAC addresses in YAML! After this YAML config file had been working for literal years! (I believe this was via netplan? It's been like a decade, I don't remember.)Turns out, if an unquoted MAC address had even a single non-decimal hex digit, it would do what we expected (parse as a string). This is not only by FAR the more common case, but also we had an A in our vendor prefix, so we never ran into this "feature" during initial development.Then one day we ran out of MAC addresses and got a new vendor prefix. This time it didn't have any letters in it. Hilarity ensued.(This behavior has thankfully been removed in more recent YAML standards.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perl has a Poland Problem. The customary file extension for Perl files is *.pl. This worked well until Apache introduced content negotiation and the convention to add a language code as file extension. It had index.html.en, index.html.de, for example.index.html.pl is where the problem started and the reason why the officially recommended file extension for Perl files used to be (still is?) *.plx.I don't have the Camel book at hand, but Randal Schwartz's Learning Perl 5th edition says:"Perl doesn't require any special kind of filename or extension, and it's better not to use an extension at all. But some systems may require an extension like plx (meaning PerL eXecutable); see your system's release notes for more information."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RelatedThe YAML document from hell (566 points, 2023, 353 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34351503That's a Lot of YAML (429 points, 2023, 478 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37687060No YAML (Same as above) (152 points, 2021, 149 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29019361&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43668290</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide on understanding and managing equity compensation, aimed at employees who receive stock options or restricted stock units as part of their compensation packages. It covers key concepts such as the types of equity compensation, tax implications, and strategic considerations for exercising options or selling stock. The content is designed to empower individuals with knowledge to make informed decisions about their equity holdings, financial planning, and maximizing the value of their compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As our 30 person startup has grown, I made a conscious decision to stop pitching stock options as a primary component of compensation.Which means the job offer still includes stock options, but during the job offer call we don’t talk up the future value of the stock options. We don’t create any expectation that the options will be worth anything.Upside from a founder perspective is we end up giving away less equity than we otherwise might. Downside from a founder perspective is you need up increase cash compensation to close the gap in some cases, where you might otherwise talk up the value of options.Main upside for the employee is they don’t need to worry too much about stock options intricacies because they don’t view them as a primary aspect of their compensation.In my experience, almost everyone prefers cash over startup stock options. And from an employee perspective, it’s almost always the right decision to place very little value ($0) on the stock option component of your offer. The vast majority of cases stock options end up worthless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Netflix approach to this [1], where Netflix allows employees to choose how much of their compensation is cash vs options seems like the best approach - you can tune based on your risk tolerance.&gt; Each employee chooses each year how much of their compensation they want in salary versus stock options. You can choose all cash, all options, or whatever combination suits you. You choose how much risk and upside (down) you want. These 10-year stock options are fully-vested and you keep them even if you leave Netflix.[1]: https://jobs.netflix.com/work-life-philosophy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On this April 13 in these United States, I can't help but think of the incredible inconvenience of how RSUs and shares sold seem to be calculated for the sake of income taxes. Please just add it up and send me the bill.  I don't want to pay more than what's due. And I don't want to cheat. For whatever reason, the typical tax interview software guesses wrong or has insufficient inputs when I feed it info from employer + brokerage. So what remains feels like guesswork with liability on both ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43675126</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The rationale for the Fennel programming language emphasizes its design goals of simplicity, performance, and expressiveness, aimed at facilitating both learning and professional software development. Fennel combines the succinctness of Lisp with the efficient execution of Lua, enabling developers to write clean, maintainable code while leveraging Lua's robust ecosystem. Key features highlighted include a focus on functional programming concepts, clear syntax, and seamless interoperation with Lua libraries, making it an attractive option for developers looking for a versatile and efficient language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not understand the appeal of LISPy languages. I get that the parser is simple and elegant, but I believe the developer (of the compiler in this case) should serve the convenience of the user, not the other way around.Writing code like this is cumbersome and unnecessarily symbol heavy, and reading it isn't really nice as well.I'd rather have the language add that extra complexity into the parser than have me stare down these endless paretheses. Parsing something C-like is not that, hard, trust me, I've done it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love seeing new languages targeting the Lua runtime.  I've been adding Lua scripting support to pretty much everything I make now.  I recently made my SSE server programmable with Lua and it's extended the functionality far beyond what I would have had the patience and time to do myself. Highly recommend Lua with mlua-rs Rust bindings.[0] https://tinysse.com[1] https://github.com/benwilber/tinysse[2] https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fennel is nice.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is great that people are going out doing stuff, having fun and learning. But this project seems like a disaster in the making.-Making your own fuel.-Using inappropriate materials (e.g. PVC)-Poor storage of motors.-People are standing quite close to the rocket when it launches.-There seem to be buildings quite close to the launch in one of the videos.-Night launches. How are you going to get out of the way, if you can't see the rocket?2 stage rockets are particularly dangerous, because as the second stage can launch horizontally or downward if the first stage tilts (as shown in one of the videos).I think they are being irresponsible with the safety of themselves and anyone nearby. I would strongly recommend they learn a bit of safe practices and make a single stage rocket that works reliably, before even attempting 2 stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to build a two-stage water rocket, Air Command Rockets has detailed build series over on YouTube[1], from simple soda bottle setups to a custom rocket that they got[2] to over 1600m (5000 ft).That's air and water propelling a rocket a mile up![1]: https://www.youtube.com/@AirCommandRockets[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCaiK3Zqs4M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Turns out, PVC was never the move. It’s lightweight, yes, but also has the structural integrity of a soggy biscuit under pressure.I believe that PVC is not considered safe for model rockets, as it turns into shrapnel if it ruptures. Happy to be corrected, if that isn't right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669981</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting! I worked previously for a company that did automatic generation of short video clips from long videos. I fine-tuned a t5 model by taking many Wikipedia articles and removing the new line characters and training it to insert them.The idea was that paragraphs are naturally how we segment distinct thoughts in text, and would translate well to segmenting long video clips. It actually worked pretty well! It was able to predict the paragraph breaks in many texts that it wasn’t trained on at all.The problems at the time were around context length and dialog style formatting.I wanted to try and approach the problem in a less brute force way by maybe using sentence embedding and calculating the probability of a sentence being a “paragraph ending” sentence - which would likely result in a much smaller model.Anyway this is really cool! I’m excited to dive in further to what you’ve done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might want to take a look at https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplitIt uses a similar approach but the focus is on sentence/paragraph segmentation generally and not specifically focused on RAG. It also has some benchmarks. Might be a good source of inspiration for where to take chonky next.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me like chunking (or some higher order version of it like chunking into knowledge graphs) is the highest leverage thing someone can work on right now if trying to improve intelligence of AI systems like code completion, PDF understanding etc. I’m surprised more people aren’t working on this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652968</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of wasting inferences when using the Aider AI tool, emphasizing the importance of understanding how AI interprets language and context. It explores the potential pitfalls of relying on Aider for making inferences and the need for users to critically evaluate the AI's outputs. The author encourages readers to be mindful of the limitations of AI, suggesting that without proper oversight and context, the inferences made by Aider can be misleading or incorrect.

I'm stuck in a loop where every day I need to explain to a new hire why they made the exact same beginner's mistake as the last person on the last day. Eventually, I'd rather spend half an hour of my own time than to explain the problem once more...Why anyone thinks having 3 different PRs for each jira ticket might boost productivity, is beyond me.Related anime: I May Be a Guild Receptionist, But I'll Solo Any Boss to Clock Out on Time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current challenge is not to create a patch, but to verify it.Testing a fix in a big application is a very complex task. First of all, you have to reproduce the issue, to verify steps (or create them, because many issues don't contain clear description). Then you should switch to the fixed version and make sure that the issue doesn't exists. Finally, you should apply little exploratory testing to make sure that the fix doesn't corrupted neighbour logic (deep application knowledge required to perform it).To perform these steps you have to deploy staging with the original/fixed versions or run everything locally and do pre-setup (create users, entities, etc. to achieve the corrupted state).This is very challenging area for the current agents. Now they just can't do these steps - their mental models just not ready for a such level of integration into the app and infra. And creation of 3/5/10/100 unverified pull requests just slow down software development process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using Cursor and Code regularly for a few months now and the idea of letting three of them run free on the codebase seems insane. The reason for the chat interface is that the agent goes off the rails on a regular basis. At least 25% of the time I have to hit the stop button and go back to a checkpoint because the automatic lawnmower has started driving through the flowerbed again. And paradoxically, the more capable the model gets, the more likely it seems to get random ideas of how to fix things that aren’t broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43672712</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warning, always convert your colors to from sRGB to Linear RGB before doing any math on them, then convert them back to sRGB afterwards for displaying them.sRGB is the familiar color space you all know and love, it's what your display uses, and it's what has those RGB numbers between 0 and 255.  But it's not a linear color space.First think of values as being between 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 255.  To change sRGB to Linear, do X^2.2 (close to squaring the value).  To change Linear back to sRGB, do X^(1/2.2) (close to a square root).In Linear RGB, a value of 0.5 is halfway between black and white.  You can put a stripe or checkerboard pattern next to the color value, and it will appear to be the same brightness.  But in sRGB, a value of 0.5 is much darker.  Linear RGB of 0.5 is roughly equivalent to sRGB of 0.73.The actual method of conversion involves a complicated curve that isn't continuous, using X^2.2 is still an approximation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm of the belief that fruit and vegetable packaging is often designed to hide defects, and to make it harder to visually discern how fresh the produce is (on top of not letting you touch it).Some examples.Red netting on oranges makes it hard to see imperfections on the skin. Green netting does the same for avocados. Costco sells corn in trays that are cling wrapped with a wrap that is unmistakably designed to hide the ends of the corn (the easiest way to discern if corn has gone bad). Other fruits, and veggies like melons, onions, and potatoes  have similar netting with colors that seem to be carefully chosen to maximize visual clutter.Why aren't all the nets the same color?Costco sometimes sells pears in plastic trays with multiple creases that cause reflections that make it very difficult to see what the pears inside look like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;First, the average pixel is not what I would expect it to be at allIt looks like the averaging was done in default sRGB color space, with:magick "$f" -resize 1x1 txt:-Downscaling should instead be done in a linear colorspace. Human vision is non-linear, but the filtering required for downscaling is equivalent to blurring, which is linear because it's done optically not within the retina or brain. Using ImageMagick:magick "$f" -colorspace RGB -resize 1x1 -colorspace sRGB txt:-Additionally, JPEG supports chroma subsampling, which is usually enabled by default. I don't know what sips does, but with these small files you might as well use PNG and avoid the risk of losing color information this way.This should produce results closer to human perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43673761</guid></item><item><title>17.

I feel a deep sense of sadness that the internet that I grew up on where I would learn and discover amazing and interesting people and things every day has just disappeared. I used to think it was absolutely magical. Now it's just boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the 2020 Oxford report on state actor manipulation it's insanely prolific. 57 Countries use bot accounts, 79 countries use human propaganda accounts. This is a top 5 pressing issue of our times. I violently hate how little the public is informed by their governments about it.https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulati...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The square artifacts in the dithered image are caused by the distribution not doing second passes over the pixels already with error distributed, this is a byproduct of the "custom" approach the OP uses, they've traded off (greater) individual colour error for general picture cohesion.Me, I adjusted Atkinson a few years ago as I prefer the "blown out" effect: https://github.com/KodeMunkie/imagetozxspec/blob/master/src/...A similar custom approach to prevent second pass diffusion is in the code too; it is slightly different implementation - processes the image in 8x8 pixel "attribute" blocks, where the error does not go out of these bounds. The same artifacts occur there too but are more distinct as a consequence.
https://github.com/KodeMunkie/imagetozxspec/blob/3d41a99aa04...Nb. 8x8 is not arbitrary, the ZX Spectrum computer this is used for only allowed 2 colours in every 8x8 block so this seeing the artifact on a real machine is less important as the whole image potentially had 8x8 artifacts anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One style suggestion: nested `for` expressions can be combined into a single `for*`, helping reduce indentation depth:    (for* ([i height]
           [j width])
      ...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dithered images have the wrong brightness mapping.The reason is that the described approach will estimate the error correction term wrong as the input RGB value is non-linear sRGB.The article doesn't mention anything about this so I assume the author is oblivious to what color spaces are and that an 8bit/channel RGB value will most likely not represent linear color.This is not bashing the article; most people who start doing anything with color in CG w/o reading up on the resp. theory first get this wrong.And coming up with your own dither is always cool.See e.g. [1] for an in-depth explanation why the linearization stuff matters.[1] http://www.thetenthplanet.de/archives/5367&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43675309</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Cargo Mutants is a project hosted on GitHub that provides a tool for generating and managing mutant tests for Rust applications using the Cargo package manager. It allows developers to create a series of mutation tests that introduce small changes or "mutants" into their code to check if existing test suites can detect these changes. The purpose of this tool is to help improve the robustness and effectiveness of tests by ensuring they catch potential errors introduced by code modifications. The repository includes documentation on installation, usage, and examples to aid developers in integrating mutation testing into their development process.&lt;/p&gt;

It was heavily inspired by https://github.com/zimmski/go-mutesting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is called mutation testing and is very common in formal silicon verification.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testingA downside of naively changing source code is that you have to recompile the code for every mutant, which can be very slow (especially for Rust!). Obviously the right thing to do is to decide at runtime whether to insert a bug or not for each mutation point.I had a brief skim through the help for cargo-mutants and it looks like it takes the naive approach which is rather unfortunate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a near perfect use of coding LLMs and a useful way to implement reinforcement learning.“Add a major bug to this file that is not covered by existing tests” vs “Find the bug in this file” vs “write a sensible test in this file that protects against this type of bug”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647605</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed explanation of cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which are fundamental concepts in information theory and machine learning. It defines cross-entropy as a measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and KL divergence as a metric that quantifies how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected distribution. The text further illustrates these concepts with mathematical formulas and examples, highlighting their applications in optimizing machine learning models, particularly in classification tasks. Additionally, it discusses the relationship between both measures, emphasizing their significance in training algorithms and model evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the notation of this page, the entropy H(P) is best thought of as:"The mean number of bits to encode a member of P, assuming an optimal code."And the KL divergence KL(P,Q) is probably best thought of as:"The mean number of WASTED bits if you encode members of P assuming that they had come from Q."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I and clearly many other people have run into what one could only call “KL variance”, but it doesn’t seem to have an  established name.https://mathoverflow.net/questions/210469/kullback-leibler-v...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I often wondered about an alternative but related metric called "organization"Entropy, in some sense would seem to measure "complexity", but it's more accurately related as "surprise" I think.It's useful but limited (for example, you can measure the "entropy" present in a string -- of keystrokes, or text -- and determine how likely it is that it's "coherent" or "intelligent" but this is fuzzy, i.e., "too much" entropy, and you are at "randomness", too little and you are at "banality"). It seems like a more precise (but still 0 - 1 bounded) metric would be possible to measure "order" or "organization". Entropy fails at this: 0 entropy does not equal "total order". Just "total boringness" (heh :))I considered something related to some archetypal canonical compression scheme (like LZ), but didn't flesh it out. Considering again now, what about the "self similarity" of the dictionary, combined with the diversity of the dictionary?It's more of a "two-axis" metric but surely we can find a way to corral it into 0..1.Very self-similar, and rather diverse? Highly organized.Low self-similarity, and highly diverse? High entropy / highly disorganized.Low self-similarity, and low diversity? Low entropy / high banality. I.e., simplicity heh :)High self-similarity, low diversity - organized, but "less organized" than something with more diversity.I don't think this is quite there yet, but there's intuitive sync with this.Any takers???? :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670171</guid></item><item><title>26.

I know of Arch of course but have never run across Arco.From the post I can't tell it's actual reach or impact but it certainly seems to have been a significant piece of work in terms of scope.I hope to still noodle on open source in my retirement (when it is time) but I could certainly see wanting to get out from under the many expectations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Arco was my first introduction into Arch-based systems - it taught me invaluable amounts of information. I run Arch Linux now, but Arco always has had a special place in my heart.

But from a coding standpoint, and despite the marketing that Agent/MCP development simplifies generative LLM workflows, it’s a long coding mess that is hard to tell if it’s even worth it. It’s still the ReAct paradigm at a low level and if you couldn’t find a case for tools then, nothing has changed other than the Agent/MCP hype making things more confusing and giving more ammunition to AI detractors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need to define and write the functions to calculate interest… what exactly is the llm bringing to the table here?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I typed in a simple program to generate an animated graphical pattern, a program I remembered from when I was about 13 [...]I'm astounded that anyone would be able to remember such a complicated program after several decades. About all I remember from those days is:  10 PRINT "HELLO";
  20 GOTO 10;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How could the computer be operating well for the most part, yet also completely wrong?Anyone who has done any overclocking knows about that. When signals or timing are marginal, intermittentness appears. In the PC world, programs like Memtest86+ and Linpack are great at stress-testing to find marginality, but I'm not sure if such software was as common in the 8-bit era.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t personally have the time or inclination to do any retrocomputing, but I love seeing the repairs that people do for them. It’s interesting in a way I wouldn’t have expected.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the history and significance of the manicule, a small hand-shaped symbol often used in manuscripts and books to draw attention to specific passages. It explores its origins, evolution, and the various forms it has taken over time, highlighting how this seemingly simple graphic has played a role in directing readers' focus and enhancing the art of annotation. The piece also discusses the resurgence of interest in such historical symbols in the context of modern design and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the frustrating things about the manicule is what I think is the reason you don't see it used online, and it is "everywhere" only in physical media: cluttered pages/GUIs and low-DPI screens mean that almost all of those manicules you see as scans just don't work as a digital manicule. It's always easier to use some sort of arrow or background highlight or other way of calling attention to a particular line. Note that OP makes no use of a manicule in this web page, and the only web example OP gives is an emoji - which was intended for SMS chat messages (and looks very ugly, even ignoring the color or other issues with emoji). That is probably why it is honored mostly in the breach by contemporary web designers - many more know about it than use it.Like that gorgeous orange (letterpress, I assume) manicule you see in the middle of OP - that line-work will never work when scaled down and put into a web page as a normal little manicule. The details get lost in a blur, the hand becomes a solid blob of black, it looks goofy and out of place (note: for the mouse pointer, this is a feature, not a bug), or it ceases to look like a hand at all to someone who isn't primed for it by an article.I can tell you that because I tried one that looked a lot like that. I went through literally hundreds of manicules from Wikimedia Commons, Font Awesome, Google Images, and articles like this, trying dozens of them on my actual website, and it took that long to find a single one I was at all happy with in context. I was shocked. No other icon I use on my site was that hard to find an adequate version of. (We really wanted a manicule for our use-case, so we persevered.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Favourite uses: Terry Gilliam's Monty Python animations? Or Dungeon Keeper, where you got to swat your underlings with the floating hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639617</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have aphantasia and probably SDAM. I can barely remember my own life.Ive been waiting for years for glasses that can scan someones face, tell me who they are, and give me interesting points about them (kids' ages, wifes name, what they do etc).It is very common for me to be around town and have people come up to me and say my name, and I dont recall ever having met them before.On the plus side I live in today and dont dwell on the past. It is like a superpower for happiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is common with SSRIs/SNRIs.For me it is not at the same intensity at all times, but it can reach levels where I forget the name of my roommate or the name of my friends partner. However, I still know that I know their names. It feels like there is an error in the communication between parts of my brain. Like it's comming any time now. But it doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found my ability to recall names (or proper nouns) to decline as I entered my 60s more than any other cognitive facility, both names of people as well as objects that have one-off names, such as 'Montessori' schools or 'Schroeder', the musician in the Peanuts comics.  I suspect such name recall is done using a minimum of secondary cues and associations, relying entirely on a very limited subset of neurons and pathways to drive the retrieval.So far, I've not been able to devise any way to improve such recall, other than to guess the likeliest first letter of the name then step through successive letters to, hopefully, trigger remembrance.  But I bery much doubt most of the memory-enhancing techniques that are in vogue will help.  Regenerating a mnemonic to cue the name is no easier than recalling the name itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648536</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the use of Go channels, asserting that they can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. It highlights potential issues such as the difficulty in understanding channel operations, the risks of deadlocks, and the challenges in debugging channel-based concurrency models. The author suggests that traditional synchronization methods, like mutexes, can be more straightforward and efficient for managing concurrency, promoting clarity and simplicity in code design. Overall, the piece encourages developers to carefully consider alternatives to channels in Go for better software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670373"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Go since 2011. One year less than the author. Channels are bad. No prioritization. No combining with other synchronisation primitives without extra goroutines. In Go, no way to select on a variable number of channels (without more goroutines). The poor type system doesn't let you improve abstractions. Basically anywhere I see a channel in most people's code particular in the public interface, I know it's going to be buggy. And I've seen so many bugs. Lots of abandoned projects are because they started with channels and never dug themselves out.The lure to use channels is too strong for new users.The nil and various strange shapes of channel methods aren't really a problem they're just hard for newbs.Channels in Go should really only be used for signalling, and only if you intend to use a select. They can also act as reducers, fan out in certain cases. Very often in those cases you have a very specific buffer size, and you're still only using them to avoid adding extra goroutines and reverting to pure signalling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I did my 20% on Go at Google, about 10 years ago, we already had a semi-formal rule that channels must not appear in exported function signatures. It turns out that using CSP in any large, complex codebase is asking for trouble, and that this is true even about projects where members of the core Go team did the CSP.If you take enough steps back and really think about it, the only synchronization primitive that exists is a futex (and maybe atomics). Everything else is an abstraction of some kind. If you're really determined, you can build anything out of anything. That doesn't mean it's always a good idea.Looking back, I'd say channels are far superior to condition variables as a synchronized cross-thread communication mechanism - when I use them these days, it's mostly for that. Locks (mutexes) are really performant and easy to understand and generally better for mutual exclusion. (It's in the name!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlike the author, I would actually say that Go is bad. This article illustrates my frustration with Go very well, on a meta level.Go's design consistently at every turn chose the simplest (one might say "dumbest", but I don't mean it entirely derogatory) way to do something. It was the simplest most obvious choice made by a very competent engineer. But it was entirely made in isolation, not by a language design expert.Go designs did not actually go out and research language design. It just went with the gut feel of the designers.But that's just it, those rules are there for a reason. It's like the rules of airplane design: Every single rule was written in blood. You toss those rules out (or don't even research them) at your own, and your user's, peril.Go's design reminds me of Brexit, and the famous "The people of this country have had enough of experts". And like with Brexit, it's easy to give a lame catch phrase, which seems convincing and makes people go "well what's the problem with that, keeping it simple?".Explaining just what the problem is with this "design by catchphrase" is illustrated by the article. It needs ~100 paragraphs (a quick error prone scan was 86 plus sample code) to explain just why these choices leads to a darkened room with rakes sprinkled all over it.And this article is just about Go channels!Go could get a 100 articles like this written about it, covering various aspects of its design. They all have the same root cause: Go's designers had enough of experts, and it takes longer to explain why something leads to bad outcomes, than to just show the catchphrase level "look at the happy path. Look at it!".I dislike Java more than I dislike Go. But at least Java was designed, and doesn't have this particular meta-problem. When Go was made we knew better than to design languages this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670373</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that parts like this are more easily replaced using a hot air station than a soldering iron.Looks like the audio amp fed by the MOSFET is a Realtek ALC1304, which I can't find any data on, but searching for the pin names finds that it could be a clone/compatible to the TI TPA3131D2/TPA3132D2. This part has a power limiter, but if the Realtek one is configured the same way, then as implemented in the laptop, it has no power limit.It is very likely that the reason the transistor failed was because of poor cooling, as it is a low cost, high-resistance transistor that is running near its design limits.The MOSFET that blew up is rated for 2A continuous, and it's in the ~19-20V VIN circuit, so it begs the question of just how loud he was playing his music when it happened!That said, not the first time laptops have come with sub-par audio circuitry:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7205759https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2012/12/10/how-to-fry-spea...https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100530/can-volume-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;None of the images load for me.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, I wrote GeoDeep, what a cool writeup! Glad someone tried to run these on satellite imagery. I did most of my testing on drone derived orthophotos, so was curious to see how it would perform with lower resolution images. Some models like the car model seem like they did poorly. I suspect it's probably because the ground sampling distance (GSD) was in the 35-56 cm/px range, whereas the car model was trained for 10 cm/px. GeoDeep can downscale the input to match the model's input resolution, but can't (currently) upscale it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, love this write up, thank you.Id love to read a little more about why onnx was chosen specifically, and what it brings to the game.There is currently a gap in open and decent models which can be applied to high resolution orthographic imagery, specifically with regards to collection of additional community resilience artefacts such as solar panels and pools. Theres plenty of vendors who want to sell such data, but its so far out of reach of so many worldwide that an open source set of models would go a hell of a long way.Thanks also for including your PC specs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the blog funny for its disclaimer for the workstation specs.&gt; There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down.Good to know!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653078</guid></item><item><title>39.

I still don't quite get why we have to do this dance and can't just install from apt into home, but whatever (downloading the .deb file and unpacking it as an archive is also an option though, but still quite some manual effort.)A great tool to manage these home-based installations is GNU Stow. In fact I've written scripts that just take the tarball, compile it with the typical workflow (autotools or cmake), setting prefix and DESTDIR as needed and then use Stow to put it in place. Then if I want to "uninstall" something, I use `stow --delete`. Works well enough for most of the use cases, like installing a newer GCC or Cmake than available on a cluster etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flying in the face of convention for no apparent reason. Use the normal FHS/XDG directories, makes everything easier.`/usr/local` for system level, non-managed packages`~/.local` for user level, non-managed packages`/opt` for system level "add-on" packages. Typically proprietary upstreams. Zoom, Discord, the proprietary builds of Chrome or VSC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too bad the search for libraries has to be consolidated.

The AmigaOS 3.2 lineage began in 2021.I didn't really get why. Reading Wikipedia articles about AmigaOS and Hyperion wasn't helpful either.Anyone has insights why this project was started and how is it financed? Not that I object it in any way, lovely to see retro software being maintained. Just being curious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The versions and branches and spin-offs almost sound sane until you realise they didn't mention Haage &amp; Partner 'Amiga Forever' lineage, which is what I imagine most users are using today - via the included WinUAE, Amiberry, or various FPGA Minimig (e.g. MiSTer) based devices.This one claims to be AmigaOS 3.9 which is a best of breed cobbled together AmigaOS and roms.I have no idea if/when this might venefit from the fixes to 3.2.3, but I'm imaging never.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amiga is the future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670238</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses dynamic arrays and memory management techniques, particularly focusing on the concept of arenas. It explains how dynamic arrays are utilized for efficient data storage and manipulation, allowing for dynamic resizing as needed. The author presents various implementations and advantages of using arenas for memory allocation, highlighting how they can improve performance by reducing fragmentation and allocation overhead. The overall emphasis is on optimizing memory use in programming, particularly in scenarios requiring frequent resizing and allocation of arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like composable single feature allocators, a free list is just another kind of allocator that may be plugged in at any point.https://github.com/codr7/hacktical-c/tree/main/malloc1https://github.com/codr7/hacktical-c/tree/main/malloc2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You can only deallocate everything in the arena, not individual parts of it.Untrue; this excludes the middle.

An excerpt can be found here [1]. Whole essay is great but I especially liked this part:&gt; The word “domesticate” comes from the Latin domus, which means “house.” Who’s the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens.[1] https://www.ynharari.com/topic/ecology/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the point of the ugly genAI interstitial images? The blogging equivalent of wearing a dunce-cap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its a symbiotic relationship, we don't survive without them and they don't survive without animals that spread their seeds and provide the CO2. Life is interlinked in this way in a huge number of things we can't separate ourselves from nature both the impact we have had in changing the biodiversity and in the necessity of that biodiversity providing this diverse range of plants and animals. Its why its so heartbreaking we are wiping out species at a rate never seen before and causing a mass extinction event which might include us if we keep up at this increasing rate of damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669301</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a critical analysis of the Pascal programming language, authored by Rob Pike. It discusses the limitations of Pascal, particularly its strict typing, lack of certain programming constructs, and constraints that can hinder flexibility and creativity in software development. Pike argues that while Pascal was designed with educational intentions, it fails to cater to the needs of professional programmers and larger-scale software projects. He contrasts Pascal with other programming languages, highlighting aspects that may offer better functionality and expressiveness for developers. Overall, the document serves as a critique of Pascal's relevance and effectiveness in modern programming contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the European Space Agency's (ESA) newly proposed commercial launch strategy aimed at enhancing its role in the competitive space launch market. It outlines the agency's intention to create partnerships with private companies and highlights the potential benefits of this strategy for ESA member states. However, the article raises concerns regarding whether these member states will commit the necessary funding to support the initiative, questioning the financial sustainability and long-term viability of the plan amidst existing challenges in the European space industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta; US produces well funded startups presumably because the exits are good. Investors don't mind the risk, expecting an outsized return.Exits are good, perhaps, because US stock valuations are just much better. Investors are happy buying at a higher P/E ratio, expecting it to go up in even further, and make a good return.Now, for a long time, there has been talk of US equities being woefully overvalued. Of course a value is only what investors are happy to pay. But supposing this is true, and US is due a major correction, Trump's "shock therapy" on markets might actually achieve it. If that's true, US valuations would drop relative to the rest of the world (this hasn't really happened yet, most of developed markets moved roughly in unison - but it's early days perhaps).If that happens, US might actually stop looking like a most attractive VC market. This would presumably lead to a general drop of VC investments - but also to a greater geographic spread in VC investments. In particular, more money going into things like European space companies, as opposed to US ones.There's a lot of assumptions here. Maybe US equities have higher valuations because they are genuinely better, or a correction won't actually come. But it always puzzles me why the US seems better at churning out well-founded startups for no totally obvious reason, and maybe that's it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "The top factors ESA will consider in this first phase of the challenge are each proposer's business plan, technical credibility, and financial credibility."The grand European strategy is... to task government bureaucrats to review startups' business plans?? This is going to so predictably lead to more of the same—the creation of companies optimized for writing proposals, and for pleasing bureaucrats.- "ESA also isn't setting requirements on launcher performance, reusability, or..."That they're still ambivalent whether they should pursue reusability or not shows how hopelessly unprepared they are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43642959</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the practice of selling space in personal homelabs for hosting services or storage, emphasizing the risks and challenges associated with this approach. It highlights concerns such as potential legal issues, the complexity of managing multiple users, and the implications for personal privacy and data security. The piece encourages individuals to maintain their homelabs for personal use, experimentation, and learning rather than turning them into commercial ventures that could compromise their original purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

Amateur hobbyists (very little money there)2.) People with Bad Intentions (horrendous from a legal and security perspective, and ethics if that’s your thing)3.) People in your social circle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, can't read the article cos' there's a soccer match right now, and the head of the Spanish league, along with Telefonica, have decided that anyone behind Cloudflare and some other CDNs and hosts are guilty of pirating the TV signal. No reading this afternoon.https://imgur.com/a/DCiE4J0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a decently-sized homelab and I've been renting out unused disk space. I actually allocated 20TB of disk space (RAID 1) and have been renting the space out via the Storj network (https://www.storj.io).If you haven't heard of it, Storj is essentially a distributed S3 that's been around for many years now, and the way it works is that various people run Storj nodes while the Storj company runs a proxy server that breaks files up into small encrypted chunks and stores them across N peers for redundancy.In my case, I back up my family photos/videos/documents to a Synology NAS, and my NAS is backed up to Storj. So when I run a Storj node with part of my disk space, the payments they give me essentially cover my own backups. I'm not making a ton of money or anything, but it's enough to pay for my own backups and that's a great deal.If you're looking to do what the OP is talking about in a simple way, this is by far the best way I've found to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43674267</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Apple Music app on macos is one of the most horrible UI things I can think of.Search: You must scroll to the top of the playlists, it's not in the toolbar and always clickable. ALSO: the switch between local/downloaded and all Apple Music is on the Other side of the Screen. It's pseudo-browse ( the back button is inline with the content, and there isn't a Forward button).I haven't been able to find a way to not show the default view that takes up half the screen. It has an image of the album cover and some flat-ux "buttons" and a checkmark icon, plus a (...)  and a 1/4 of the screen just empty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not explicitly called out anywhere, but you can have this and the 'background noise' running at the same time.  This 'chill' music with some dark noise mixed in is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re using the Music app and putting your collection into it consider buying the itunes match subscription. This automatically uploads all your songs and syncs them to all your devices. I download ALACs from albums I buy on Bandcamp and put them into Music, it’s definitely the best feature.https://support.apple.com/en-us/108935&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643120</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Microgravity 101" provides an overview of the concept of microgravity, explaining that it refers to conditions where objects appear to be weightless, typically experienced in space environments like the International Space Station (ISS). It discusses how microgravity affects physical phenomena, including fluid dynamics, combustion, and biological processes, highlighting its significance for scientific research and technological advancements. The article emphasizes the opportunities microgravity offers for experimentation that cannot be conducted on Earth, ultimately contributing to fields such as medicine, materials science, and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Gravity is always present. What you feel as “weightlessness” is actually freefall.Article makes this seem true, regardless of whether or not you are in orbit. But doesn’t  this matter of perspective become ridiculous if you are floating freely in space? As in, yes, you’re “falling” but only because Earth is moving away from you or toward you? Honest question here…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused, the article simultaneously claims the ISS isn't "zero-G" and is "0G". Is it possible to conduct a true 0G experiment on the ISS, or is there always microgravity i.e. '10⁻³G to 10⁻⁶G'?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648423</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like that this review is written by someone who gave Math Academy a serious try. He mentions comments by a couple of other math educators (Michael Pershan and Dan Meyer), but I haven't seen any evidence that either of them has used Math Academy for enough time to evaluate it.(At the time I recommended my son start doing Math Academy, I had done 3722 XP myself, which is about 60 hours' worth.)It's true that there's a stronger emphasis on procedural fluency than on conceptual understanding. But honestly I think that's good: there's so much good material online for conceptual understanding.Imagine you're studying linear algebra: use Math Academy for rigorous introductions to topics and exercises and feedback, and watch 3Blue1Brown videos for conceptual understanding.For younger kids (my son is 8.5yo) I wish Math Academy had some animated or video explanations. For example, the prealgebra course includes the product rule for surds. It was hard for my son to grok based on reading the written explanation. Not because the explanation was bad, but because my son has the attention span of an 8.5yo. So I spent a few minutes walking through that same explanation with him, using a paper and pencil to guide his attention.I also wish they had a mascot and a streak feature. Those features on Duolingo somehow help to motivate my son.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This review reads very much like one written by someone who reluctantly is trying to find excuses to criticize it. Many of the things he says feel made up.For example,&gt; Many of the questions I answered correctly were in areas that I don’t feel I understand well, but where I suppose I had drilled enough in the past for my procedural fluency to survive 20 years of atrophy.The author is complaining that he felt like he should have done worse because emotionally he thought he knew it less than he actually did. This is an entirely fictional, made-up criticism. He obviously knew it better than he "felt" he did.The entire review reads like this, trying to make up real-sounding criticisms that to me just don't make very much sense. The DAG criticism as well doesn't make sense. There is no "one way". The DAG approach probably works for many if not most students, but of course there are other students it won't work for. Exactly like how phonics works for many students but some need to be taught whole word reading. You can't criticize the DAG approach just because some students can't learn that way, but they have to pick one method. I would expect a teacher to have a better critcism than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author mentions Simmons' Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes (1972), which is at Internet Archive:https://archive.org/details/differentialequa0000simm/page/n6...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43656481</guid></item><item><title>1.

They seem to be simultaneously asking for:- an end to diversity initiatives- a new diversity initiative for diverse points of view- a new policy of not admitting international students with certain points of view- ending speech-control policies- auditing the speech of certain departments and programs- ending discipline of students who violate policies related to inclusion- disciplining particular students who violated policies related to inclusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With their endowment above $50 billion, combined with Federal plus Non-Federal sponsored revenue at 16% of operating budget, it makes sense to me they just forgo Federal funds and operate independently.If all 16% is canceled, then they'd need to draw an additional $1 billion per year from endowment at current budget levels.That would put them above 7% draw so potentially unsustainable for perpetuity, historically they've averaged 11% returns though, so if past performance is a predictor of future, they can cover 100% of Federal gap and still grow the endowment annually with no new donations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684536</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinator of the authorization RFC linked in this post[1].The protocol is in very, very early stages and there are a lot of things that still need to be figured out. That being said, I can commend Anthropic on being very open to listening to the community and acting on the feedback. The authorization spec RFC, for example, is a coordinated effort between security experts at Microsoft (my employer), Arcade, Hellō, Auth0/Okta, Stytch, Descope, and quite a few others. The folks at Anthropic set the foundation and welcomed others to help build on it. It will mature and get better.[1]: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MCP is just a transport + wire format with request/response lifecycle and most importantly: tool-level authorization.The essay misses the biggest problem with MCP:  1. it does not enable AI agents to functionally compose tools.

  2. MCP should not exist in the first place.

LLMs already know how to talk to every API that documents itself with OpenAPI specs, but the missing piece is authorization. Why not just let the AI make HTTP requests but apply authorization to endpoints? And indeed, people are wrapping existing APIs with thin MCP tools.Personally, the most annoying part of MCP is the lack of support for streaming tool call results. Tool calls have a single request/response pair, which means long-running tool calls can't emit data as it becomes available – the client has to repeat a tool call multiple times to paginate. IMO, MCP could have used gRPC which is designed for streaming. Need an onComplete trigger.I'm the author of Modex[^1], a Clojure MCP library, which is used by Datomic MCP[^2].[^1]: Modex: Clojure MCP Library – https://github.com/theronic/modex[^2]: Datomic MCP: Datomic MCP Server – https://github.com/theronic/datomic-mcp/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author makes good general points but seems to be overloading MCP's responsibilities imo. My understanding of MCP is that it just provides a ready-made "doorway" for LLMs to enter and interact with externally managed resources. It's a bridge or gateway. So is it really MCP's fault that it:&gt;makes it easier to accidentally expose sensitive data.So does the "forward" button on emails. Maybe be more careful about how your system handles sensitive data. 
How about:&gt;MCP allows for more powerful prompt injections.This just touches on wider topic of only working with trusted service providers that developers should abide by generally.
As for:&gt;MCP has no concept or controls for costs.Rate limit and monitor your own usage. You should anyway. It's not the road's job to make you follow the speed limit.Finally, many of the other issues seem to be more about coming to terms with delegating to AI agents generally. In any case it's the developer's responsibility to manage all these problems within the boundaries they control. No API should have that many responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43676771</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article details how the author, Geoffrey Litt, created a simple AI assistant using just one SQLite database and a few scheduled tasks (cron jobs). He outlines the development process, emphasizing the minimalistic approach that leverages existing tools and technologies. The assistant is designed to perform useful tasks, demonstrating that complex AI applications can be built with limited resources by effectively employing data storage and automation techniques. Additionally, Litt shares insights and personal reflections on the project, showcasing how accessible AI can be for individual developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if I love this more for the sheer usefulness, or for the delightful over-the-top "Proper English Butler" diction.But what really has my attention is: Why is this something I'm reading about on this smart engineer's blog rather than an Apple or Google product release? The fact that even this small set of features is beyond the abilities of either of those two companies to ship -- even with caveats like "Must also use our walled garden ecosystem for email, calendars, phones, etc" -- is an embarrassment, only obscured by the two companies' shared lack of ambition to apply "AI" technology to the 'solved problem' areas that amount to various kinds of summarization and question-answering.If ever there was a chance to threaten either half of this lumbering, anticompetitive duopoly, certainly it's related to AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This made me think: what if my little utility assistant program that I have, similar to your Stevens, had access to a mailbox?I've got a little utility program that I can tell to get the weather or run common commands unique to my system.  It's handy, and I can even cron it to run things regularly, if I'd like.If it had its own email box, I can send it information, it could use AI to parse that info, and possibly send email back, or a new message.  Now, I've got something really useful.  It would parse the email, add it to whatever internal store it has, and delete the message, without screwing up my own email box.Thanks for the insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been kicking around idea for a similar open source project, with the caveats that:1. I'd like the backend to be configured for any LLM the user might happen to have access to (be that the API for a paid service or something locally hosted on-prem).2. I'm also wondering how feasible it is to hook it up to a touchscreen running on some hopped-up raspberry pi platform so that it can be interacted with like an Alexa device or any of the similar offerings from other companies. Ideally, that means voice controls as well, which are potentially another technical problem (OpenAI's API will accept an audio file, but for most other services you'd have to do voice to text before sending the prompt off to the API).3. I'd like to make the integrations extensible. Calendar, weather, but maybe also homebridge, spotify, etc. I'm wondering if MCP servers are the right avenue for that.I don't have the bandwidth to commit a lot of time to a project like this right now, but if anyone else is charting in this direction I'd love to participate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681287</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The OpenSourcing DeepSeek Inference Engine project on GitHub aims to provide an open-source framework for deep learning model inference. It includes a well-documented repository with resources for developers to implement and utilize the DeepSeek Inference Engine effectively. The project emphasizes accessibility and collaboration within the AI community, offering tools and examples to facilitate the integration of advanced neural network models into various applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In March, vLLM picked up some of the improvements in the DeepSeek paper. Through these, vLLM v0.7.3's DeepSeek performance jumped to about 3x+ of what it was before [1].What's exciting is that there's still so much room for improvement. We benchmark around 5K total tokens/s with the sharegpt dataset and 12K total token/s with random 2000/100, using vLLM and under high concurrency.DeepSeek-V3/R1 Inference System Overview [2] quotes "Each H800 node delivers an average throughput of 73.7k tokens/s input (including cache hits) during prefilling or 14.8k tokens/s output during decoding."Yes, DeepSeek deploys a different inference architecture. But this goes onto show just how much room there is for improvement. Looking forward to more open source![1] https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/03/19/how-we-opt...[2] https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/20...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really empathised with this part:&gt; Codebase Divergence: Our engine is based on an early fork of vLLM from over a year ago. Although structurally similar, we’ve heavily customized it for DeepSeek models, making it difficult to extend for broader use cases.I've been there. Probably a few of us have.Their approach of working on splitting out maintainable sublibraries and sharing info directly even if not integrated seems a really nice way of working with the community -- ie, they have obstacles, but they're not letting the obstacles cause them to take the easy route of not contributing at all. And while it might seem better to someone wanting to use their techniques to share only working code, not info on the techniques, at least it's still knowledge sharing. And again I think it'd be easier for them not to do it. So kudos to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What motivates the commercial AI companies to share their research results and know-how?Why did Google published the Transformer architecture instead of keeping it to themselves?I understand that people may want to do good things for humanity, facilitate progress, etc. But if an action goes against commercial interest, how can the company management take it and not get objections from shareholders?Or there is a commercial logic that motivates sharing of information and intellectual property? What logic is that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682088</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was thinking of building exactly this type of thing here. This is great and I love the simple/minimalistic styled pages.Things I was also contemplating to implement you can freely steal:1. Giving a list of potential interesting investments - these could also be behind paywall.2. Summarize based on sectors to see where there's downturns coming - again maybe paywall this3. Connect with news-sites or twitter etc.. to see what is happening and what is the sentiment. This is a lot harder as you'll need to either scrape or pay to get that info.Best of luck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read lots of quarterly report summaries. I like what you're doing here, but you need to be aware that AI summaries are already built into many existing platforms. So don't expect to be able to monetize this as it stands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love it! This is a very useful tool to provide me with introductory (but granular enough) information about new investment ideas that I have.Just two cents based on my usual workflow --1. I like to compare companies within the same industry, so it would be good if i can ask follow up questions after reading a report like "How does company Y compare with company X on XX metrics?"2. I understand that the reports are generated by a model; if that is true, maybe you could cross-reference the fillings with their corresponding earnings call transcripts (should be available for free on many investment websites) and highlight what is being discussed/asked in the calls as wellAgain, thank you for the great work. Already pinned your site to my browser's investment workspace XD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43675248</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, there's a lot of cynicism in this thread, even for HN.Regardless of whether or not it works perfectly, surely we can all relate to the childhood desire to 'speak' to animals at one point or another?You can call it a waste of resources or someones desperate attempt at keeping their job if you want, but these are marine biologists. I imagine cross species communication would be a major achievement and seems like a worthwhile endeavor to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work at Google on the Gemma team, and while not on the core team for this model, participated a bit on this project.I personally was happy to see this project get built. The dolphin researchers have been doing great science for years, from the computational/mathematics side it was quite neat see how that was combined with the Gemma models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not directly related, but one of those stories that is so bizarre you almost can't believe it isn't made up.There was a NASA funded attempt to communicate with Dolphins. This eccentric scientist created a house that was half water (a series of connected pools) and half dry spaces. A woman named Margaret Howe Lovatt lived full-time with the Dolphins attempting to learn a shared language between them.Things went completely off the rails in many, many ways. The lead scientist became obsessed with LSD and built an isolation chamber above the house. This was like the sensory deprivation tanks you get now (often called float tanks). He would take LSD and place himself in the tank and believed he was psychically communicating with the Dolphins.1. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/08/the-dolp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43680899</guid></item><item><title>8.

The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others," Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro said in a statement.Everyone knew at the time that Facebook bought Instagram because it threatened Facebook's dominance, and hindsight shows that exactly that happened. There's a huge swath of people that dropped off FB and now use Insta, but Meta owns both. It was a great move but it was absolutely anti-competitive at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who’s stuck with Whatsapp and no way out (friends and family won’t switch), I dearly hope for a split.I do struggle to understand how we here casually lump tohether totally different platforms as comptetitors.It’s not like I can use Youtube or Tiktok instead of Whatsapp with my family for direct and group discussion. Even X and Instagram would be a stretch, as their raison d’être is public social media and not instant messaging.Sure the platforms have overlapping features, but you ain’t gonna use a knife insted of a spoon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other articles posted about this:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/meta-antitrust...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long until such "rules" also become standardized (like we saw with MCP)? It feels redundant to have rules.cursorrules and rules.aiderrules where the rules content is the same. I predict companies will not only publish coding guidelines for their programmers, they'll publish these tiny coding rules for LLMs used in the company as well, so all code follows the same standards/idioms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have found Cursor to be frustrating and exhausting to work with, even with my rules file. When it works, it’s like magic. But most of the time, it feels like working with a Jr. dev who has a bit of a concussion. Code review is wearying work, and using Cursor means you’re doing a lot of code review. I have never once gotten into a flow state with it.That was a long preamble to this question: any senior devs out there (20+ years) who enjoy using Cursor? What’s the trick?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found this a tractable approach, but sometimes not enough. My escalation pattern with cursor looks like this:1. Document everything that you're doing and update a core architecture or technical doc that the LLM can read.2. Update your .cursorrules with specific instructions for .cursor which can grow more specific as you nail down parts of your stack and the patterns you're following. This can be updated (by cursor itself) if you find the same problems recurring.3. I have pre-commit script which runs some internal scripts. If I find the IDE is STILL making the same mistake after I've documented it and added cursor rules, the nuclear option is to add a script here which verifies the integrity of whatever construct is being violated (e.g. tests go into this folder structure, env variables are consistent between these files, import of this model that the LLMs like is forbidden)I would add: any time you expect to be working on a particular feature / enhancement / refactor, have the LLM create a temporary document with a description and an implementation plan and work from that.In addition: I have a specific workflow for resolving testing errors or pre-commit errors which follows the above pattern: Document each failure and work through them one at a time, running the test script and updating the document between runs.I've established these patterns slowly with usage, but it has improved my experience a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658923</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced its intention to adopt Anthropic's proposed standard for integrating AI models with data, which aims to enhance interoperability among various AI systems. This initiative is part of Google's broader effort to improve collaboration within the AI community, ensuring that different models can share data and insights more effectively. The move reflects a growing emphasis on establishing common frameworks for AI development, which could lead to more efficient and innovative applications in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks similar to most other mid-level remote procedure call protocols, from XMLRPC to CORBA.
The usual sync, async, poll, progress test problems apply.
Things I'd expected to see and didn't:- Client to server: "tell me what you can do". This has always been hard, but in the LLM era, it could potentially work, because a textural response would work.- Similarly, being able to ask "How do I..." might be feasible now. It should be possible to talk to a new server and automatically figure out how to use it.- "How much is this going to cost me?" Plus some way to set a cost limit on a query.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given their anti-trust  struggles, if Google for some reason dominates AI, they'd not want people to bring up anti-competitive behavior as a reason for that. Adopting open standards, especially open standards conceived outside Google is good for everyone including Google. They're well placed - from research to hardware to software and data.They'll also want the industry to rapidly move forward and connect data to AI. MCP has momemtum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google owns 14% of Anthropic, author of MCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646227</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a neat idea. It's not too dissimilar in spirit from gradient boosting. The point about credit assignment is crucial, and that's the same reason most architectures and initialization methods are so convoluted nowadays.I don't really like one of their premises and conclusions:&gt; that does not learn hierarchical representationsThere's an implicit bias here that (a) traditional networks do learn hierarchial representations, (b) that's bad, and (c) this training method does not learn those. However, [a] is situational, and it's easy to construct datasets where a standard gradient-descent neural net will learn a different way, even with a reverse hierarchy. [b] is unproven and also doesn't make a lot of intuitive sense to me. [c], even in this paper where they make that claim, has no evidence and also doesn't seem likely to be true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jsft3c/r_...I'm still not quite sure how to think of this. Maybe as being like unrolling a diffusion model, the equivalent of BPTT for RNNs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting idea for sure, but why only evaluate it on 28x28 pixel images? Why is their flow matching so much worse in some cases? Missing some analysis. Their words on it say nothing:&gt; For CIFAR-100 with one-hot embeddings, NoProp-FM fails to learn effectively, resulting in very slow accuracy improvementIn general any actual analysis is made impossible because of the lack of signal in the results.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering why it is so satisfying. It tells that what you pursue doesn't matter. It can be a wood-planing contest or some silly hobby. What matters is that you are motivated to pursue it. You believe in improving that pursuit, you see others doing the same, you believe it is the social norm, you see that it is valued and respected. And most importantly you feel good about it.Talk about things like investing in stocks, being known as a great techie or entrepreneur, exiting a great startup, running a venture capital, making a few million, becoming US citizen, having a great home etc. These goals are not bad. Just that they cost more, for the same returns (satisfaction). You are more successful when your happiness doesn't cost you a life-time running around or some herculean effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential but the name is a pun - "kezuroukai" translates to "shall we shave?" in Japanese, but "kai" can also mean something like "gathering" or "community".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow 10 micron is a lot smaller than I thought a handmade wood shaving would be. Th champions are even better in the single digits consistently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679004</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the experiences and insights of a former Google employee who transitioned to a different career path. It highlights their personal journey, lessons learned while working at Google, and the challenges faced when adapting to life outside the tech giant. The piece delves into the impact of corporate culture on individual growth and the importance of pursuing personal interests and passions post-Google.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Layoffs are a difficult thing for employees and their managers.  I have seen people (one was a VP of Engineering) escorted out of the building, sent in a cab to home along with a security guard (this was in India), not allowed access to computer or talk with other employees. 
 But, recently have had a very different experience. The current company I work for announced 30% layoffs. The list was made public within one hour of announcement. The CEO detailed the process of selecting people. The severance was very generous (3-6 months pay) along with health and other benefits. The impacted employees were allowed to keep the laptop and any other assets they took from the company.  They even paid the same severance to contractors.After the announcement, the laid off employees were given a few days in the company to allow them to say good byes. I love the CEOs comment on this ' I trusted them yesterday, I trust them today'. This was by far the kindest way of laying off employees imo. People were treated with dignity and respect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've skimmed through the comments; and seen that most people have commented on the cog in the machine thing, or on layoffs in general and how they suck.To me, the shock from this blog post was about seeing a Chrome developer relations engineer whom I have grown to admire and who has been doing a stellar job educating web developers on new html and css features, get the sack. He was one of the best remaining speakers on web topics at the Chrome team (I am still sad about the departure of Paul Lewis and Jake Archibald); and produced a lot of top-notch educational materials (the CSS podcast; the conference talks; the demos).What does this say about Google's attitude to web and to Chrome? What does this say about Google's commitment to developer excellence?I understand that this is a personal tragedy for Adam; but for me personally, this is also a huge disillusionment in Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But I was also immediately ripped away from my calendar, docs, code, and more.Layoffs are never easy. I've been through a few myself and it really takes the wind out of your sails. That being said, this sentence made me pause a bit. None of these things mentioned are actually yours. They are the property of Google.One thing that helped me immensely in my career is understanding that my relationship with a company is a business relationship. They pay me for my time and skills and nothing more. Today I can have a job and tomorrow maybe not. I recommended learning how to separate your value from your employer. It's not easy but it's necessary. I'm not saying you can't enjoy what you do or be excited by it but don't fully tether yourself and your well-being to a company.Godspeed!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658089</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an in-depth exploration of the internal workings of SQLite, a lightweight and serverless database engine. It covers various components and features of SQLite, including its architecture, the SQL language implementation, data storage mechanisms, and optimization strategies. The content is aimed at developers and database enthusiasts seeking to understand how SQLite operates under the hood, with detailed explanations, diagrams, and code examples to illustrate key concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This really would've come in handy when I was debugging my own SQLite parser a couple weeks ago.One thing that initially confused me was how exactly the pages worked w.r.t. the first page on disk... I misunderstood the SQLite documentation in different ways, but it's really rather simple: the very first page is just treated as containing the file header in it, and it pushes down the rest of the data, making the page shorter than the other pages. You can see that illustrated clearly if you click into the first page of a database using this tool: the database header comes first, then the page header.This tool will undoubtedly come in handy for anyone who has a reason to be dealing with SQLite data structures directly for whatever reason, especially since the SQLite documentation is a bit terse at times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I especially like that it provides a sample database. Would be nice it were downloadable as a file, so we could explore it with our own tools as well and get a better feeling for how the tool works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is super cool and will really help anyone studying how to build their own storage engines.A note: the table that describes the data structures (Field # | Description | Value) should also list the data type (uint8 uint16 int32 text etc.). If it's an enum ("Table Leaf"), reference other possible enum values. If its length depends on another field, reference that field No.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682006</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recently discovered vulnerability in GitHub Copilot and Cursor, highlighting how these code generation tools can be exploited by malicious actors. It explains that attackers can manipulate the input to these AI-driven code agents, potentially leading to the generation of harmful code snippets. The piece emphasizes the implications of such vulnerabilities for software security and calls for heightened awareness and protective measures within the developer community to mitigate risks associated with automated coding assistance tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article:&gt; A 2024 GitHub survey found that nearly all enterprise developers (97%) are using Generative AI coding tools. These tools have rapidly evolved from experimental novelties to mission-critical development infrastructure, with teams across the globe relying on them daily to accelerate coding tasks.That seemed high, what the actual report says:&gt; More than 97% of respondents reported having used AI coding tools at work at some point, a finding consistent across all four countries. However, a smaller percentage said their companies actively encourage AI tool adoption or allow the use of AI tools, varying by region. The U.S. leads with 88% of respondents indicating at least some company support for AI use, while Germany is lowest at 59%. This highlights an opportunity for organizations to better support their developers’ interest in AI tools, considering local regulations.Fun that the survey uses the stats to say that companies should support increasing usage, while the article uses it to try and show near-total usage already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; effectively turning the developer's most trusted assistant into an unwitting accomplice"Most trusted assistant" - that made me chuckle. The assistant that hallucinates packages, avoides null-pointer checks and forgets details that I've asked it.. yes, my most trusted assistant :D :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most concerning part of the attack here seems to be the ability to hide arbitrary text in a simple text file using Unicode tricks such that GitHub doesn't actually show this text at all, per the authors. Couple this with the ability of LLMs to "execute" any instruction in the input set, regardless of such a weird encoding, and you've got a recipe for attacks.However, I wouldn't put any fault here on the AIs themselves. It's the fact that you can hide data in a plain text file that is the root of the issue - the whole attack goes away once you fix that part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677067</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that the universe tends toward increasing complexity over time, examining various scientific perspectives and theories that explain this phenomenon. It highlights how complexity arises in different systems, from biological evolution to physical processes, and explores concepts such as entropy and self-organization. The piece also delves into the implications of this tendency for our understanding of the universe and its fundamental principles, suggesting that complexity is not just a byproduct of randomness but an integral aspect of cosmic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677232"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tried reading the paper [1]. I understand the authors are academics, which is why I'm surprised the paper reads like a layman's attempt at a contributing to a "theory of everything", or at best, an inquiry written by a 18th century European philosopher of science.- "identification of conceptual equivalencies among disparate phenomena were foundational to developing previous laws of nature" - what exactly is a "conceptual equivalence"? You mean models? Unifying disparate observations into models is basic science. Not sure why it is highlighted here as some important insight.- "The laws of classical physics emerged as efforts to provide comprehensive, predictive explanations of phenomena in the macroscopic world" - followed by a laymen's listing of physical laws, then goes on to claim "conspicuously absent is a law of increasing “complexity.”"- then a jumble of examples including gravitation, stellar evolution, mineral evolution and biological evolution- this just feels like a slight generalization of evolution: "Systems of many interacting agents display an increase in diversity, distribution, and/or patterned behavior when numerous configurations of the system are subject to selective pressure."At this point, I gave up.[1] https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310223120&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coincidentally, I'm reading Walker's book "Life as No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence" on the same topic. (Walker is one of the researchers in the article.) Summary: I don't like the book. The book was motivating me to write an article "Books I don't like", but I'll comment here instead :-)The book describes "Assembly Theory", a theory of how life can arise in the universe. The idea is that you can quantitatively measure the complexity of objects (especially chemicals) by the number of recursive steps to create them. (The molecule ATP is 21 for instance.) You need life to create anything over 15; the idea of life is it contains information that can create structures more complex than what can be created randomly. The important thing about life is that it isn't spontaneous, but forms an unbroken chain through time. Explaining how it started may require new physics.If the above seems unclear, it's because it is unclear to me. The book doesn't do a good job of explaining things. It looks like a mass-market science book, but I found it very confusing. For instance, it's unclear where the number 21 for ATP comes from, although there's an analogy to LEGO. The book doesn't define things and goes into many, many tangents. The author is very, very enthusiastic about the ideas but reading the book is like looking at ideas through a cloud of vagueness.The writing is also extremely quirky. Everyone is on a first-name basis, from Albert (Einstein) to Johnny (von Neumann) and Erwin (Schrödinger). One chapter is written in the second person, and "you" turn out to be "Albert." The book pushes the idea that physics is great and can solve everything, covering physics "greatest hits" from relativity and quantum mechanics to gravitational waves and the Higgs boson. (The underlying theme is: "Physics is great. This book is physics. Therefore, this book is great.") The book has a lot of discussion of how it is a new paradigm, Kuhn's paradigm shifts, how it will move astrobiology beyond the pre-paradigmatic phase and unify fields of research and so forth. It's not a crackpot book, but there are an uncomfortable number of crackpot red flags.I'm not rejecting the idea of assembly theory. To be honest, after reading the book, I don't understand it well enough to say which parts seem good and which parts seem flawed. There seem to be interesting ideas struggling to get out but I'm not getting them. (I don't like to be negative about books, but there are a few that I regret reading and feel that I should warn people.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Complexity" is a hugely problematic term when used in this way - remember that entropy and complexity are related, but they are not interchangeable. A complex system can have lower entropy than a simpler system, and conversely, a system can have high entropy but be relatively simple.  By mingling these terms without specifying objective reference points, it all just comes out as word salad.This paper just reads like an attempt at sounding smart while actually saying little.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677232</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The project provides TypeScript definitions for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) generated code, allowing for seamless integration of protobuf with TypeScript in applications. It aims to enhance the TypeScript developer experience by offering type safety and improving readability when working with protocol buffers. The repository includes installation instructions, usage examples, and details on how to contribute, making it a comprehensive resource for developers looking to leverage protobuf with TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that the source is so small is wild. I would have expected a huge convoluted parsing library implemented in types.On the other hand, the fact that this is even possible is more wild. Instead of replacing JS with a proper statically-typed language, we're spending all this effort turning a preprocessor's type system into a turing-complete metalanguage. Pretty soon we'll be able to compile TypeScript entirely using types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s pretty rad how flexible template literal types are, but I can’t imagine wanting this kind of shenanigans hanging out in a production app slowing down compile times. I prefer to define types in TypeScript and generate proto from that, since the TypeScript type system is so much more powerful than the Protobuf system. Types are much more composable in TS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This would be even nicer if TypeScript added type inference for tagged template literals, like in this issue [1]. Then you could write:    const schema = proto`
      syntax = "proto3";

      message Person { ... }
    `;

    type Person = typeof schema['Person'];

And you could get built-in schema validation with a sophisticated enough type definition for `proto`, nice syntax highlighting in many tools with a nested grammar.We would love to see this feature in TypeScript to be able to have type-safe template in lit-html without an external tool.The issue hasn't seen much activity lately, but it would be good to highlight this library as another use case.[1]: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33304&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682547</guid></item><item><title>18.

I wonder if there’s a way to “escape” from the system. It looks nice for getting started but in practice at some point you’ll want programmatic access for e.g. advanced API features.E.g. a well behaving system independent pipeline serialization could work. Didn’t find anything about this with a quick glance of the docs.Edit: with a bit longer glance there is a plugin system that allows adding custom code quite easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43660952</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces Docker Model Runner, a new tool designed to simplify the deployment and management of machine learning models. It allows developers to run models as containers in a standardized environment, ensuring consistency across various stages of development and production.

Docker Desktop is free for personal use, but it requires a paid license if you work for an organization sized 250+. This feature seems to be available in Docker Desktop only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why add another domain-specific command to a container manager and go out of scope for what the tool was designed for at first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643944</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of porting classic Infocom text adventure games to modern platforms using the Cosmo environment. It outlines the challenges encountered during this porting process, such as adapting original source code to run on current systems while preserving the games' original functionality and experience. The author shares insights into the technical aspects of the process, including issues related to graphics and user interface adaptations. Additionally, the article highlights the importance of maintaining the charm and narrative style of the original games while making them accessible to newer audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny coincidental timing - I just played HHGTTG a couple of times last night for the first time in thirty+ years or so.I first played the game, way back - prior to having read the novel. It was mind-blowing. I had no idea what was going on but I got a real sense that it could be pretty funny if I did. So I read the novel eventually, and it was as good as I expected. I don't think I'd gone back to play the game until this week, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its interesting to see how developers get into a mindset, based on their life experience.What we're seeing here is 40 year old code compile and run with minimal effort. Largely because the C language has respected backwards compatibility.Yes, there were breaking changes along the way, but they were trivial to resolve in hours. And (more interesting) the author believed that to be true and so persevered.I saw this recently as well. I run a lot of programs on Windows. Many are 32 bit, written in the 90s for Windows 95, or 98. They all still run. Microsoft bends over backwards to keep things compatible.I also get to write a lot of web API clients. I tell customers that it won't work forever. Web APIs are constantly changing. The service (especially Google) will change something soon to break it.The people building those APIs are expecting only currently-maintained apps to run. They have no concept (or experience) of 40 or 30 year old code "just running". Crumbs, if you get 5 years out an API client you're doing well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone needs to do the sort of "fix up scattered declarations and move them to headers", you really want to use:  gcc -Werror=missing-declarations -Werror=redundant-decls

(last I checked, Clang's implementation of this was buggy and half-useless, but I'll admit I stopped using Clang)I recommend this for well-maintained code too, just as another way to keep the code smells away. For a lot of projects this will only require adding a bit of `static` that you were too lazy to write.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677909</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Karen Wynn Fonstad, a cartographer from Wisconsin, has gained recognition for her detailed maps of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world, particularly "Middle-earth." Her work includes intricate illustrations that help fans better understand Tolkien's stories and settings. Fonstad's passion for mapping extends beyond fantasy, as she also creates educational maps and emphasizes the importance of geography in literature. Her unique contributions to the intersection of cartography and literature celebrate Tolkien's legacy and have solidified her position as a significant figure in both fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atlas of Middle-earth is a truly monumental feat.I think the article writer misses how much of it is really about The Silmarillion, rather than about Lord of the Rings. Tolkien put a lot of work into First Age geography, an entire (interminable, excruciating) chapter of The Silmarillion. Very little of it would be familiar to viewers of the films, and a lot of it opaque even to readers just of LotR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A wonderful atlas -- my favorite are her trail maps where she depicts a character's daily journey in the book.The article (almost) footnotes her other work which was equally impressive:* She also created atlases for the worlds of fantasy authors Anne McCaffrey, creator of the “Dragonriders of Pern” series, and Stephen R. Donaldson, who wrote “The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant” series.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love fantasy in general, and have read a ton of it. other than tolkien, I have never read a novel with that strong a sense of geography in a constructed world - specifically, that there is an entire rich land out there, and not just a graph of interesting places with the focus shifting from one point to another. when the hobbits have to go from the shire to rivendell, or aragorn has to take the paths of the dead to reach his destination in time, tolkien really manages to convey the experience of a difficult journey that takes a significant amount of time even when nothing plot-significant is happening along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43656267</guid></item><item><title>23.

I just wish they would update the extension on the firebase extensions hub[1] because the current version available uses node 14 which is not supported by cloud functions on GCP so the extension is not usable at all.
What's weird is that the latest version available on their repo has upgraded the node version but they are not offering it in the extensions hub.[1]: https://extensions.dev/extensions/meilisearch/firestore-meil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43680699</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of entropy in various contexts, primarily in thermodynamics and information theory. It discusses entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, highlighting its significance in understanding energy distribution and transformations. The author also touches on how entropy relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Additionally, the article explores entropy's implications for data and information, illustrating how it quantifies uncertainty and information gain. Overall, the piece aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy and its relevance across different fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I throw these quotes by Y. Oono into the mix because they provide viewpoints which are in some tension with those who take -\sum_x p(x) log p(x) definition of entropy as fundamental.&gt; Boltzmann’s argument summarized in Exercise of 2.4.11 just derives Shannon’s formula and uses it. A major lesson is that before we use the Shannon formula important physics is over.&gt; There are folklores in statistical mechanics. For example, in many textbooks ergodic theory and the mechanical foundation of statistical mechanics are discussed even though detailed mathematical explanations may be missing. We must clearly recognize such topics are almost irrelevant to statistical mechanics. We are also brainwashed that statistical mechanics furnishes the foundation of thermodynamics, but we must clearly recognize that without thermodynamics statistical mechanics cannot be formulated. It is a naive idea that microscopic theories are always more fundamental than macroscopic phenomenology.sources:

He has a foundational/philosophical bent and likes to point out that there are competing definitions of entropy set on different philosophical foundations, one of them seemingly observer dependent:
- https://youtu.be/x9COqqqsFtc?si=cQkfV5IpLC039Cl5
- https://youtu.be/XJ14ZO-e9NY?si=xi8idD5JmQbT5zxNLeonard Susskind has lots of great talks and books about quantum information and calculating the entropy of black holes which led to a lot of wild new hypotheses.Stephen Wolfram gave a long talk about the history of the concept of entropy which was pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/live/ocOHxPs1LQ0?si=zvQNsj_FEGbTX2R3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the last few months, I've been developing an unorthodox perspective on entropy [1] . It defines the phenomenon in much more detail, allowing for a unification of all forms of entropy. It also defines probability through the same lens.I define both concepts fundamentally in relation to priors and possibilities:- Entropy is the relationship between priors and ANY possibility, relative to the entire space of possibilities.- Probability is the relationship between priors and a SPECIFIC possibility, relative to the entire space of possibilities.The framing of priors and possibilities shows why entropy appears differently across disciplines like statistical mechanics and information theory. Entropy is not merely observer-dependent, but prior-dependent. Including priors not held by any specific observer but embedded in the framework itself. This helps resolve the apparent contradiction between objective and subjective interpretations of entropy.It also defines possibilities as constraints imposed on an otherwise unrestricted reality. This framing unifies how possibility spaces are defined across frameworks.[1]: https://buttondown.com/themeaninggap/archive/a-unified-persp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684560</guid></item><item><title>25.

And the "loving couple holding IA hands and then dancing", well, the input is already cringe enough.For all these diffusion models, look like we are 90% here, now we just need the final 90%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;really the next big leap is something that gives me more meaningful artistic control over these systems.It's usually "generate a few, one of them is not terrible, none are exactly what I wanted" then modify the prompt, wait an hour or so ...The workflow reminds me of programming 30 years ago - you did something, then waited for the compile, see if it worked, tried something else...All you've got are a few crude tools and a bit of grit and patience.On the i2v tools I've found that if I modify the input to make the contrast sharper, the shapes more discrete, the object easier to segment, then I get better results. I wonder if there's hacks like that here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video to audio examples are really impressive! The video featuring the band showcases some of the obvious shortcomings of this method (humans will have very precise expectations about the kinds of sounds 5 trombones will make)—but the tennis example shows its strengths (decent timing of hit sounds, eerily accurate acoustics for the large internal space). I'm very excited to see how this improves a few more papers down the line!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683907</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without arguing the merits of the Altera investment or divestment, a common pattern for Intel seems to be a wild see-sawing between an aggressive and a defensive market posture - it’s a regular occurrence for Intel to announce a bold new venture to try to claim some new territory, and just as regular that they announce they’re halting that venture in the name of “consolidating” and “focusing on their core.” The consequence is that they never give new ventures time to actually succeed, so they just bleed money creating things they murder in the cradle, and nobody born before last Tuesday is investing in bothering to learn the new Intel thing because its expected lifespan is shorter than the average Google product.Intel either needs to focus or they need to be bold (and I’d actually prefer they be bold - they’ve started down some cool paths over time), but what they really need is to make up their goddamn minds and stop panicking every other quarter that their “ten-year bets” from last quarter haven’t paid off yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rest in Peace Altera I guess? I still drink out of my color changing Altera mug (that's long stopped changing color) most days. PE ruins everything so it's only a matter of time before they're gutted and sold for scraps by the vultures at Silver Lake. (though honestly the writing was on the wall since the Intel acquisition I had held onto some hope) If only we had a functioning government interested in actually maintaining our technological dominance and enforcing/expanding antitrust legislation. I wrote my first Verilog on an Altera chip and I'll remember them fondly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's worked at Xilinx before and after the merger, it's a surprise they were even able to sell it for that much. Altera has been noncompetitive to Xilinx in performance and to Lattice in terms of low-end/low-power offerings for at least the last 2 generations.I'm concerned about the future of FPGAs and wonder who will lead the way to fix these abhorrent toolchains these FPGA companies force upon developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43686773</guid></item><item><title>27.

All because docker &amp; nft (nftables firewall) don't play nice together.I have my finely crafted nftables ruleset that I want to keep. Docker is going to abuse the crap out of my ruleset/make me jump through extra hoops to have it work.Having the containers operate under systemd looks fine (ignoring the fact that it is systemd, I guess I have finally accepted systemd is here to stay).I was interested in using traefik &amp; docker labelling to have ingress sorted out and I believe this will all play nicely enough to replace docker-compose on a single server.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683641</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The late PowerPC-era Macs are really fun to play with, because they're an interesting blend of modern niceties like USB and Ethernet but are limited with how old most software is. There's still a scene of people working on bringing newer versions of GCC and other *nix utilities to Tiger or Leopard, working with the pre-release PPC betas of Snow Leopard, and trying to keep online services working despite aging TLS versions and retired APIs. Compiling takes forever until it fails with an obscure C11 error or missing C library features. And that makes for a fun, if often frustrating, challenge.But PPC32 Linux support is quickly falling off. Gentoo isn't just used because it's fun to leave your lampshade iMac G4 compiling a kernel for days, but because it's one of the few distros still supporting the platform. There's unsupported testing repos for Debian (and maybe Ubuntu?) plus the up-and-coming Adelie. Otherwise your best bet is OpenBSD - FreeBSD and NetBSD usually lack precompiled ports, and FreeBSD has announced the next major release will almost definitely drop 32 bit PPC.The 64 bit G5 systems are much better supporte. I'm pretty sure they can boot ppc64le that many distros target. They're also even more modern - the final models had PCIe, SATA, and up to 16GB of DDR2 RAM. Sadly there's nothing modern about the power efficiency, nor the self-destructing water cooling system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of fun reading that.I'm a bit of a hoarder when it comes to technology, truth be told there's a certain rose tinted nostalgia that I get from thinking about early 00's technology.It was still the era where UI's felt immediate and snappy- that anything related to actual computation or internet was jank and slow, but it had a whiff of a hopeful future about it. Every PC upgrade made things more snappy back then... Now I dread upgrades.Hey ho.It's endearing to know that one more bit of early 00's technology has been given a new lease on life. Would be cool to write some native software for it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, that's me! (in the Discord screenshot)I think I took the PRAM battery and hard drive out because both were dead. But the RAM I cannot remember what happened, either me or someone else might've scavenged it for another project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677165</guid></item><item><title>30.

I got lost at around chapter 5 because the author couldn't use words like "gravity" and "acceleration" and I got confused by which one is "new pull" and which one is "old pull". It's too bad, as it was interesting up to that point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of "Gadsby", a 50.000 word novel without the letter "e":https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678312</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great work! I love commitment to make it at no cost as @liamwire mentioned. Still not sure why on Earth car manufacturers would not just release APIs open to all owners (basically issue API key based on VIN) and let them use it. For developers to build apps that will only require API key to be entered would be win/win for everyone....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's pretty cool! It's extremely frustrating that they go through so much effort to block third party apps, but the solution of just downloading and emulating the android app is simoultaneously very clever and very straightforward.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers using the KATRIN experiment have reported new findings that narrow down the mass of neutrinos, fundamental particles that have intrigued physicists for decades. The experiment, which involves studying the behavior of electrons emitted from tritium decay, has provided a more precise measurement, suggesting that neutrinos are lighter than previously thought. This advancement aids in understanding the role of neutrinos in the universe's formation and could have implications for particle physics and cosmology, particularly in developing theories beyond the Standard Model. The improved mass limit enhances our understanding of the universe’s structure and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This measurement was performed in a lab in Germany.  The main spectrometer of the apparatus used for the measurement was fabricated in Germany.  The delivery route was almost 9000 km.  https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/march-2007/deconstr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hm, one thing I’m unclear on is…Well, from what I understand, the mass eigenstates and the flavor eigenstates for neutrinos aren’t the same, so a mass eigenstate is a linear combination of the different flavor eigenstates, and a flavor eigenstate is a linear combination of the different mass eigenstates,But, in these experiments with the electron neutrino, which is a flavor eigenstate, well, it isn’t in a mass eigenstate, so, what does that say about the momentum and such?And like, when they use this to get a bound on the mass, is this like, a bound on the mass of the largest of the 3 mass eigenstates, or of the expected value of mass when in the electron neutrino flavor eigenstate, or what?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love to see KATRIN represented here. I am a student at the university this is at. The area (nothern campus) this is at is a bit secluded and normally not accessible to students but I managed to take part in a tour of the northern campus. I even got some points (ects) for it which is nice.It was really impressive. The whole northern campus is full of giant science experiments like this one, old nuclear test reactors and so much more. I'm glad I got the opportunity to see it. They even got an entire water treatment plant, direct heating and direct cooling networks and produces more electricity than it uses on average.I was really fascinated by the scale of everything. The direct heating plant for example uses a few giant room sized gas-burning generators and uses their excess heat. But just for backup, in case gas drops out there are also 2-3 absolutely massive tanks next to the building that hold something like 2 million or so liters diesel fuel each, just as a backup. One of the technicians joked "yeah, we fill up a few thousand liters now and then when its cheap"All in all absolutely amazing experience and really cool campus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648922</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the most commonly-cited (but not actually all that practical) example for rejection sampling is estimating the value of pi (as hinted by the first example under uniform random sampling): generate two random numbers between 0 and 1, then check the fraction of points that satisfy x^2 + y^2 &lt;= 1. As number of samples tends to infinity, this will converge to pi/4. (You can instead take x,y from (-1,1) if you want to generate points on the full circle.)&gt; However, rejection sampling is only efficient when f_Omega can make use of a significant proportion of the probability density in f_D.Perhaps a more relevant example: the unit n-sphere encloses a vanishing amount of volume as the number of dimensions increases.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_an_n-ballThis is one of those weird consequences that gets labeled as the curse of dimensionality, especially in ML contexts."As the dimension d of the space increases, the hypersphere becomes an insignificant volume relative to that of the hypercube."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality#Distan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly related, I once created an app that calculate the volume of a random shape using Monte Carlo https://github.com/victorqribeiro/monteCarlo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681990</guid></item><item><title>34.

    set_property(SOURCE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/binaries.c PROPERTY GENERATED 1)

Or using `EMBED_FILES`I just happened to be looking at this very thing today that had to do this: https://github.com/espressif/esp-serial-flasher/blob/master/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go for the SPI version, which is the same chip but just s different breakout board.Many ESP32's can only do 400kHz I2C, whereas their SPI peripheral can often do 80 MHz or more (although you wouldn't want to go that fast here). 400kHz sort of works, but if you also want to handle other I2C devices it can easily become a problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really love the SSD1306 for its educational value. If you've bought a sensor kit for Arduino or ESP32 or Pico or whatever, chances are decent that you already have an SSD1306 lying around. There's so much example code for it. And the datasheet was pretty easy to grok IMO. My first exposure to it was in the pico-examples repo: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/i2c...There's a few Rust libraries for it, too.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did Advent of Code in Janet the year before last I think, and really loved the PEG support. Essentially every day started out with making a quick grammar to parse the problem into whatever data structures I was using. It's intuitive, pretty easy to pick up and adjust, and powerful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a fan of PEG. It is straightforward to write a fast parser generator for languages that require just one character of lookahead to disambiguate any alternation in the grammar. This gets you most of the expressivity of PEG and nearly optimal performance (since you only need to look at one character to disambiguate and there is no backtracking). Just as importantly, it avoids the implicit ambiguities that PEG's resolution algorithm can hide from the grammar author that lead to unexpected parse results that can be quite difficult to debug and/or fix in the grammar.It does require a bit more thought to design an unambiguous language but I think it's worth it. While there is a learning curve for designing such languages, it becomes natural with practice and it becomes hard to go back to ambiguous languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:10:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649781</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are several advantages to intrusive node-based data structures that I haven't seen stated in the article or the comments:- the same object can move between containers with no allocation and no need for a dedicated complex API- the same object can be part of multiple containers at once; particularly useful for intrusive binary trees, for indexing data with different criteria.- the container can be fully polymorphic, no need for all elements to be the same dynamic type.- no need for complex allocators, you can just store the objects as you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The new version isn't generic. Rather, you embed the linked list node with your data. This is known as an intrusive linked list and tends to perform better and require fewer allocations.I don’t get this. In the generic version the data is embedded with the linked list node, so there’s only one allocation per node. ‘T’ isn’t a pointer (or doesn’t have to be) there’s no indirection between data and node.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like a net negative result. It removes some of the complexity of using generics, but it couples between the data type and the collections it can be indexed by.What are the benefits of this approach? Is it limited to data alignment, or is it out of a greater desire to remove generics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679707</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So story time.I've been hosting a DnD campaign with a group of college friends for almost a decade at this point. Since we've all moved away, we use Tabletop Simulator to play weekly.In one of my adventures, the players met a creature named Dorian with the same backstory as the classic tale The Picture of Dorian Gray. Later, the players discovered the secret to the creature's immortality was an indestructible painting of the creature.Nearly a month before encountering this creature, my players had explored a random dungeon I’d made where one of the rooms had a huge, ornate mirror on the wall. It made everything in the reflection appear older, covered in a layer of cobwebs and dust.Although this was not the primary solution to defeating Dorian, I laid subtle clues to see if anyone would remember that far back. Well, one of them did in fact remember the dungeon. They stole the painting and brought it back to the dungeon along with a secondary mirror. They then placed the mirrors across from each other along with the painting to create a sort of “hall of mirrors” effect on the painting itself, which caused the painting of Dorian to accelerate in age—creating a feedback loop that infinitely aged Dorian (think drinking from the wrong Holy Grail).It was amazingly satisfying to all my players, and it's also the exact sort of thing that I don't think the current batch of SOTA LLMs (even with the temperature cranked to 1) would ever think of in a MILLION years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using an LLM as DM Assistant for almost a year, now, by way of EchoDelphi[0], a tool we built at a public weekend hackathon[1].It listens to the game, then sends the transcript for inference. I've been prompting the LLM to generate "threats" and "setbacks" based on the current scenario, and that way I always have something handy when the dice[2] indicate fortunes' turn.I use this for about three hours a week, 50+ weeks in a row. Pretty good for a weekend hack!0. Https://EchoDelphi.github.io1. Thank you Hacker Dojo, Mtn. View2. https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FyXSpsn-z28/WgfgacmVdtI/AAAAAAAAA...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would really like to see what a reasoning model with access to player character information, resources available in the location, and the monster manual could do. One of the hardest things as a DM, in my experience, is creating a balanced encounter without fudging. This has always made it hard for me to justify presenting a truly deadly encounter which I feel has lowered the stakes of the game. It seems like it should be possible to create a system that knows the strengths/weaknesses of a party and that could create a challenging but not overwhelming encounter most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677265</guid></item><item><title>39.

Got to do what they got to do, and it's not something I want to do, but I'm proud of them. They started with my technology, and I wish them well.¹: https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/20...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with just the 65C816, the register modes (8 or 16) bit can be a challenge to work with. When working on the PANCAKE-ROM project, I got bit by mixing up what mode the CPU was in while writing some memory locations. The memory manipulation was assumed to be in 16 bit mode, but it was 8 bit. The 65C832 makes this even more rough.I've done a little 65816 coding and I quickly learned that it was best to standardize on register sizes throughout most of the code and for routine calls, only switching to optimize things. 8-bit A and 16-bit X and Y made the most sense by far for small-scale asm code. It let you work in 8 bits when dealing with registers and using common 8-bit variables, while being able to loop over larger data structures with X and Y as memory addresses and counters, and also manipulate 16-bit values to some degree (copying, incrementing/decrementing).Other common CPUs of the time instead either had different registers names for different sizes (80x86), or coded the size in the instruction (68000). This avoided the mode bits and issues with code written for different modes (which even affected instruction length of the 65816 when using immediate data).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The W65C816 is a 16 bit version of the 6502 CPU.The 32 bit version, called the W65C832, only exists as a datasheet 
This is a FPGA version."builds with the regular opensource FPGA tools: yosys, nextpnr-ice40, icepack, and iceFUNprog.

And there's no an actual unencrypted HTTP/2 traffic, so there's no incentive to censor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The obvious follow-up is to then put a (possibly obfuscated) TLS connection in the request and response bodies, creating another tunneling method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:11:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684492</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide for individuals planning to bike across the country, outlining essential preparations and tips for a successful journey. It covers topics such as choosing the right bike, planning your route, packing efficiently, training for endurance, and ensuring safety while on the road. The guide emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and being mentally prepared for the challenges of long-distance cycling. Additionally, it offers insights into potential resources and support systems available for cross-country cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One theme that pops out to me here is the reliance on other people being a positive experience for the author. In the software field, we tend to live pretty high up the economic value chain, which can abstract us a bit from participation in the more grassroots co-operative aspect of society. This can be alienating and warp worldview.When I'm hitchhiking to support packrafting trips or get back to where I launched my paraglider, I have no say in who I'm going to be chatting with and feeling gratitude towards. Initially that feeling of being reliant on whoever comes my way was difficult to adjust to after the false sense of individualism that a high paying job in a bubble of similar people brings.The benefit though is enormous. Now I stop to help anyone who's broken down on the side of the road despite the flash judgements their car or bumper stickers might bring. I'm much more aware of the value and interconnectedness of our society, and feel inspired to actively seek to contribute instead of remaining aloof. Most importantly, I realize that there's a whole lot of people out there looking to help people out at any turn, and that gives me a lot of faith.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that finding free camping outside when you are in some shit nothing town is probably the most important skill to have, which is easy with satellite maps. Once you get the hang of it you realize that every town has at least one site where you can definitely get away with pitching a tent for one night. I think I have camped this way about 80 times and have never even been asked what I'm doing. That said, state and national park campgrounds are a great deal and you sometimes meet other tourers there, so they're good for a day when you want to take it easy for a morning. I sometimes get a kick out of zooming in on nowhere, USA and looking for spots.And some advice for anyone doing this for the first time and feels compelled to pay to camp - never stay at a KOA, consider them an absolute last resort. There is no bigger waste of money and RV culture is extremely cursed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Props to the author for grinding through this, but I think a very strongly worded and formatted warning is needed at the top. Embarking on this trip with so little knowledge meant putting yourself far away from civilizations while criminally underprepared.I love the energy of Supertramps, but there is a reason they are controversial. It would be very easy to make a mistake and be in big trouble - underestimating water needs in a barren stretch, a hole in your tire (not tube) and not knowing how to fix it, etc. it’s pure luck you didn’t not over exert a small muscle or ligament locking you out of cycling during recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681936</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a humorous take on finance and investing, particularly highlighting the concept of "stonks," a meme that symbolizes the rise of stock prices and investment trends. It features a variety of stock market statistics, charts, and advice, often presented in a light-hearted and accessible manner. The content aims to engage both novice and experienced investors by combining entertainment with relevant information about making smart financial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious if anyone else reading this knows about the equivalent of US "pink sheets," publicly traded companies that have either never been listed or have been delisted due to low share price / market capitalization.Here in the US, you can buy publicly traded companies in the US for a song; in fact, that was the source for the "acquiring" company in a lot of those reverse-acquisitions of the late 2000s / early 2010s: publicly traded companies that had a ticker, but were basically defunct. A company that wanted to go public without the scrutiny of an IPO process could "buy themselves" with the tiny, publicly traded company, thereby getting a ticker and access to retail investors. (This was not a good phenomenon, fwiw, though it definitely anticipated the SPAC craze... which was also not good, for similar reasons.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies like these are hard to find in the US because of the twin curses (or joys, depending on your views) of "maximizing shareholder value" and "SEC regulation".If you list on a big exchange, your investors will expect revenue and profit to go brrr quarter after quarter forever. It's a treadmill you can never get off. Amazon is uniquely special in that Bezos persuaded investors to keep faith for the best part of a decade. Or perhaps "lucky": one wonders what their stock price would have done without the incredible luck of the former side hustle of AWS becoming the engine of their business. (Not to denigrate the incredible feat that it is, or the work that went into it.)Regulation provides some practical limits on how small you can be, too. All those 10-Ks and audits and SOX compliance don't come cheap. You need to be big enough to employ specialists to do it or rich enough to partner up with Deloitte.The alternative is to list on a pink sheet exchange, but then you are keeping company with a long long tail of companoes that give off sketchy vibes. A one man Nevada corporation selling healing oils, or an interest in a hitherto-undiscovered source of limitless energy. I cant think of any company that graduated from this part of the market into full DJI/Nasdaq respectability. Maybe someone knows of one?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before Covid I thought I'd chuck a few hundred dollars into a trading app to understand that 'game' a little bit better. I chose a few companies I knew from work and some biotechs that had fun ticker names. One company had 'mRNA' which I thought was funny, so I bought 50 dollars of stock.Turns out mRNA stands for Moderna and I wish I put in more than 50 dollars as it went from ~$19 to almost ~$400 per share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678988</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Apple's advancements in differential privacy, a technique designed to enhance user privacy while allowing for data analysis. It outlines how Apple employs differential privacy to aggregate trends from user data without compromising individual privacy. The research highlights the methods used to implement this approach, its effectiveness in preserving user confidentiality, and its application in improving user experiences across various Apple services. The article emphasizes Apple's commitment to privacy and its efforts to leverage machine learning in a way that benefits users without compromising their data security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on a similar system at Google for gboard, the Google branded android keyboard that we called “federated analytics” - it worked with device-to-device communication and invertable bloom lookup tables. I’m still not super sure how the Apple system works after reading it, but I don’t see ant mention of using data structures like that, instead they are polling the devices themselves it seems? Does anyone else have more insight to the mechanics, because that seems super inefficient?https://research.google/blog/improving-gboard-language-model...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This approach works by randomly polling participating devices for whether they’ve seen a particular fragment, and devices respond anonymously with a noisy signal. By noisy, we mean that devices may provide the true signal of whether a fragment was seen or a randomly selected signal for an alternative fragment or no matches at all. By calibrating how often devices send randomly selected responses, we ensure that hundreds of people using the same term are needed before the word can be discoverable. As a result, Apple only sees commonly used prompts, cannot see the signal associated with any particular device, and does not recover any unique prompts. Furthermore, the signal Apple receives from the device is not associated with an IP address or any ID that could be linked to an Apple Account. This prevents Apple from being able to associate the signal to any particular device.The way I read this, there's no discovery mechanism here, so Apple has to guess a priori which prompts will be popular. How do they know what queries to send?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Improving GenmojiI find it odd that they keep insisting on this to the point that it's the very first example. I'm willing to bet 90% of users don't use genmoji and the 10% who have used it on occasion mostly do it for the lulz at how bizarre the whole thing is.It seems to me that they don't really have a vision for Apple Intelligence, or at least not a compelling one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43685714</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprisingly enough, this partially exposes the link between depression and some of the autoimmunal diseases. One example is how patients with psoriasis have significantly elevated levels of proteins from the IL-17 family (namely, IL-17A, IL-17C, and IL-17F) - up to 4 to 8 times above nominal values.At the same time, bimekizumab, one of the bleeding-edge psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatments, suppresses production of IL-17A and IL-17F (methotrexate does that, too, albeit to a much smaller degree). As a result, people receiving IL-17 suppressors become happier over the course of years, and not only due to months-long remission - I had a chance to see this in one of the experimental treatment programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read a study a while ago, the study found common vitamin deficiency in depressed humans.I researched more about it and looks like some of the deficiency in the vitamins in the study are correlated with higher IL-17 levels.Carnitine: Seems to have some effect in decreasing IL-17?Vitamin D: Highly impacts IL-17 (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4609465/)COQ10: Decreased plasma levels of IL-17 (https://www.clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(22...)Folic Acid: Reduces IL-17 (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8839991/)Lutein: I didn't find any study that seems to study the effect on IL-17Citrulline: No relevant studiesThis is the study I'm referring to: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-023-02696-9I think we're getting closer to find some blood level correlations, so we can fix them!I can say for a fact when I take CoQ10, I feel my energy levels going up so it really has some effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related paper on receptors: https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00279-XPaper suggesting mood alteration: https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00278-8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682686</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun thing to study and read about. The differences are quite small though. Wouldn't the error bars dwarf the differences? I'd assume you could tweak various assumptions and easily arrive at another conclusion.I know that the Romans were good at record keeping for their time. But I understand the best population estimates for the Roman empire are based on economic metrics like agricultural modeling which in turn must make assumptions about wealth distribution. As for the Han, I don't think they've left us a complete census either.To quote "How Many People? Ancient Demography" [0]:&gt; We generally estimate uncounted women, children and elderly males by using demographic modeling based on model life tables – data tables which project mortality simulations based on real-world populations. But how do you know what tables to use? The answer here has typically been that you comb the evidence you have (grave inscriptions, fragmentary census records that survive in Egypt) to create a statistical snapshot of your population and then try to match that, as best you can, to one of the extant models that ‘best fits.’ [...]&gt; That leaves the question of how many enslaved persons and those too poor to be counted in some of our figures.[0] https://acoup.blog/2023/12/22/collections-how-many-people-an...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there some assumption here that inequality is bad? Or that there's some ideal number? Or that there's a meaningful comparison with modern economies?I see "inequality" as a concept like "uncertainty", it can be pointed to as the source of social and economic issues, but only is undesirable that rain is seen as undesirable weather. Nobody likes being on the wrong end of these, but they are inevitable and natural (to some extent) and I think we're better off trying to acheive a society that works with an equilibrium wealth distribution. Umbrellas rather than weather control machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the first two maps, there seems to be little difference between income per capita and income inequality: the regions with greater per capita income also show greater inequality. Is this because some people always end up at zero no matter the region, so that increasing per capita income from X (lower) to Y (higher) stretches the ranges of income from zero to Y and thus increases disparity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43642568</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; C doesn't try to save you from making mistakes. It has very few opinions about your code and happily assumes that you know exactly what you're doing. Freedom with responsibility.I love C because it doesn't make my life very inconvenient to protect me from stubbing my toe in it. I hate C when I stub my toe in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  #define hc_task_yield(task)   
  do {     
    task-&gt;state = __LINE__;   
    return;     
    case __LINE__:;           
  } while (0) 


That's just diabolical. I would not have thought to write "case __LINE__". In the case of a macro, using __LINE__ twice expands to the same value where the macro is used, even if the macro has newlines. It makes sense, but TIL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reason I believe C is and always will be important is that it stands in a class of its own as a mostly portable assembler language, offering similar levels of freedom.When your computer is a PDP-11, otherwise it is a high level systems language like any other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:12:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679781</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is meta, but I really hate the way this post is written. It's full of the "startup cool" aesthetic, which I'm really averse to.The main elements of the aesthetic that I can pinpoint are things like everything being a superlative ("security leaders" instead of just "people who work in security", "legendary investors" instead of just "experienced/well-known investors"), the bullet format, heavy use of buzzwords when more everyday words would do, etc.It comes off as trying to elicit a fake "let's all get hyped up and build unicorn moonshots wooo" feeling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Of course, in retrospect, Wiz had many key ingredients working in their favor:&gt;Strong, proven founding team (Adallom founders + Microsoft Cloud Security Leadership)
Great, sticky product
Solving deeply felt pain point(s)
Timing (founded just as the world goes remote due to COVID-19 + cloud boom)
Legendary investors + network effects (Sequoia Capital, Cyberstarts, Index Ventures etc.)
Lots of early funding ($480M+ within a year of emerging from stealth )
Relentless executionWhy is nearly half a billion in funding so far down on the list?That’s probably the most important factor here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Lots of early funding ($480M+ within a year of emerging from stealth )&gt; By May 2023, ARR reached $200M, and by February 2024, it was $350MThere is little substance about how the invested money was absorbed and how that absorption led to such an ARR. Did it pay for integrations and hand holding for each contract? Or was it used to bluntly bribe the CISOs to use their product?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678123</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting ... it's presented in the context of drugs for curing infections.I wonder if this is being used for other drugs.  My curiosity stems from personal experience: I had Migraine headaches from age 17 to about 35.  I was put on ancient seizure medication that's common prescribed for Bipolar[0] because this doctor had three other patients that it nearly eliminated Migraine from.  It was fall, a time when I'd get about one a week.  After five days of taking it, I had my first Migraine ... if you could call it that -- I could only identify that it was a Migraine by the aura; the pain was about 10% what I'm used to).Searching through the web, I found a forum that was filled with Migraine sufferers.  Sure enough, there were a handful of people who swore by it.  There were also a handful of people who it didn't work for.  Looking at the more official sources, there was no indication that this drug could have any effect on Migraine; they listed all of the other off-label uses[1], but Migraine was not among them.This medication had been in the news several times (and on the front page, here[2]) over the last few years and a year ago (or so), I looked it up on the "official sources", again.  It now indicated that it was prescribed for Migraine.It made me wonder ... how are things like that figured out/communicated down-stream?  Is it entirely informally amongst doctors?  I went to four different specialists before I found one who suggested this drug -- and he did so in a "half-hearted manner" not truly expecting it would work.  It'd be nice if this was centrally tracked/managed as it might surface both "new uses for old drugs" and "new problems with old drugs."[0] Which I do not have.[1] It's rarely, if ever, prescribed for what it was originally approved for.[2] It's Depakote, I'm not being cagey for nefarious purposes, I just didn't want this to be a drug advertisement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just today I read about this in the book "Who is Government" by Michael Lewis where he presents the case on how it can help find cure for rare diseases. You can read his article at https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2025/mic....Also highly recommend the book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many interesting, off-label novel uses for drugs that have already been developed. Recently my wife &amp; I adopted a kitten that developed FIP, a disease caused by a feline coronavirus that was nearly 100% fatal up until just a few years ago.Turns out, a drug developed by Gilead Sciences (GS-441524) which is the active metabolite of remdesivir, is remarkably effective at treating the disease. It's a nucleoside analog, so it essentially is a slightly modified adenosine molecule which disrupts the virus RNA replication process.Within 12 hours of the first dose our cat went from dying to making a full turnaround and complete recovery following treatment. For us it was truly a miracle drug, and it only gained awareness recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. It still isn't technically "approved" for this use case, but is prescribed off-label by vets as of 2024 once the FDA relaxed its position [2]. Folks needed to seek it out on the black market (and still do in some areas).[1] https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/remdesiv...[2] https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-announ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:13:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648649</guid></item></channel></rss>
