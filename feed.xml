&lt;p&gt;The Coccinelle documentation provides an overview of a tool designed for matching and transforming C code, primarily used for software maintenance and code refactoring. It describes the tool's capabilities in analyzing source code, its syntax for writing transformations, and how to apply these transformations effectively. The documentation also includes examples, guidelines for creating and running Coccinelle scripts, and details on integrating it into development workflows, emphasizing its benefits for developers in improving code quality and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I missing something? I see a lot about how to install and run this "tool for pattern matching and text transformation", but basically nothing that concretely explains how to tell it what patterns to match or text transformations to apply. It seems to be using a language called "SmPL" for this but I had to do a separate search for that and even then the only real documentation I could find was a reference grammar (https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/docs/main_gr...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coccinelle is French for lady bug. Cool tool. It's been around for what feels like forever but outside of the Kernel, people unfortunately still seem to prefer regex.I also met Julia when I did an exchange semester at diku, Copenhagen, DK. She's really nice. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42512839</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently came across a VS Code extension that does pretty much what you're looking for -&gt; Out-of-Code Insights is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to add annotations, notes, and comments without modifying your source files.https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesG...GitHub:https://github.com/JacquesGariepy/out-of-code-insights/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the first time I've ever heard of someone keeping private source-line-attached notes in a codebase. I work with very large codebases, but if I discover things about the codebase that required spelunking, I generally turn them into comments or documentation.Of the requirements that you've laid out, I'd suggest that you need to either relax requirement 2 or 3:If you relax requirement 2, you could keep your notes in a private fork.If you relax requirement 3, and make your notes suitable for public consumption, you could submit your notes as comments and make the codebase easier for everyone to understand. (Or, at least, you could submit some of your comments, making the remainder easier to maintain privately.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The closest I've come to doing something like this is commenting poorly-commented code, and keeping my in-progress comments in a branch that I regularly rebase.You said that becomes unmaintainable as the source evolves, but that's surely a fundamental property of keeping notes on changing code? You have to do work keeping your private comments up to date with any method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42514803</guid></item><item><title>49.

I was able to generate a Fourier-Poisson cube [0] in about 10 minutes, and the UI is incredibly intuitive.The focus on commutative diagrams, rather than a free-form canvas, is a brilliant design choice that keeps it clean and easy to use.

They’re sort of like if finite state machines could be multithreaded.I first found out about petri nets when reading the writings of an organization called “statebox”. Statebox was interested in petri nets and commutative diagrams (as well as many other category theory concepts). I read some of their papers, was entranced, and it became my dream to work there. Unfortunately their homepage now is just the text “imagine being a category theorist” with a laughing-crying emoji, so I have no idea what happened to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just used this a few days ago to draw a simple diagram [0] for my book [1]! 
Unfortunately, because it is for category theory only, it doesn't have much support for prettifying your nodes, but you can do that with the latex, of course.[0] https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMSw2LCJcXHRleHR7TmF0dXJhbCBEZ...[1] http://abstractionlogic.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42520151</guid></item><item><title>3.

The damage potential of switching your entire air defense setup to a more aggressive posture will eventually result in civilian casualties. This happens everywhere, just the other day an American F-18 was shot down  by an American destroyer in the Red Sea, and an F-18 carries additional deconfliction equipment that an airliner doesn't have. As of today Europe is still using the peacetime kosher method of "we need to intercept it with a combat jet, have a look, ask the president, then maybe shoot it down".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I don’t understand is why Russian SAM operators did not appear to expect the airliner via its flight plan. Commercial flights file flight plans with Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). Flights into Russia would almost certainly be filed with FATA, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency.I see two possibilities: 1) the flight plan was known to the officer in charge of the SAM site and he was under orders to shoot the plane down and now they’re trying to cover it up or 2) it was a genuine mistake and so there was some kind of miscommunication or perhaps the air defence forces weren’t even looking at flight plans and just shooting at anything that looked suspicious on radar. Gross incompetence and lack of training and coordination in the Russian military are all issues we’ve come to expect so it’s easy to see how this could happen without knowing for sure. And since Russia seems to be in full denial/obstruction mode we might never know exactly what went wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521598</guid></item><item><title>4.

The Lambda retrieves three C1 level words in Dutch, their translations, and an example from ChatGpt. Those words are stored in DynamoDB so they will not be sent again. They are then sent to my email.I didn't want to pay for expensive vocabulary apps that often start with beginner words while I am looking for advanced vocabulary, so I built it myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is eerily well-timed!My partner and I do something similar for Korean &amp; English (she’s Korean native and is fluent in English and I’m learning Korean). We actually built it out for ourselves and some friends and just released it yesterday[0].Still working out some kinks, but it sends a question every weekday via email that you’d respond to. It then sends back feedback on vocab &amp; grammar, all with spaced repetition baked in to keep track of words you learn/use as you continue.It’s currently tailored towards those that can already read and have basics under their belt.[0] https://dailytokki.com/?ref=hn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With all respect and love to the OP, I must admit that I laughed out loud when I saw the AWS architectural diagram and wondered whether this might be a joke.

Misappropriation of funds?We were bench customers until a few months ago, paying thousands of dollars per year for what could only be described as hundreds of dollars worth of service. The service was not very good so moving away was an easy choice but on a per-customer basis they must be making money hand over fist.I expect we'll find out more eventually, hopefully employees will leak some insight. For now, this is inexplicable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We know this news is abrupt and may cause disruption, so we’re committed to helping Bench customers navigate through the transition.No, you're not.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) and raises questions about whether the existing approaches may lead to a dead end in terms of development and innovation. It discusses the limitations of current AI models, particularly in their inability to generalize beyond their training data and the challenges posed by ethical considerations and societal impacts. The text argues for the importance of exploring alternative methodologies and frameworks to enhance AI's potential, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and critical analysis to ensure that AI can evolve productively and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been following the whole thing low key since the 2nd wave of neural networks in the mid 90s - and made a very very minor contribution to the field which has applications these days back then too.My observation is that every wave of neural networks has resulted in a dead end.  In my view, this is in large part caused by the (inevitable) brute force mathematical approach used and the fact that this can not map to any kind of mechanistic explanation of what the ANN is doing in a way that can facilitate intuition.  Or as put in the article "Current AI systems have no internal structure that relates meaningfully to their functionality".  This is the most important thing.  Maybe layers of indirection can fix that, but I kind of doubt it.I am however quite excited about what LLMs can do to make semantic search much easier, and impressed at how much better they've made the tooling around natural language processing.  Nonetheless, I feel I can already see the dead end pretty close ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As of right now, we have no way of knowing in advance what the capabilities of current AI systems will be if we are able to scale them by 10x, 100x, 1000x, and more.The number of neuron-neuron connections in current AI systems is still tiny compared to the human brain.The largest AI systems in use today have hundreds of billions of parameters. Nearly all parameters are part of a weight matrix, each parameter quantifying the strength of the connection from an artificial input neuron to an artificial output neuron. The human brain has more than a hundred trillion synapses, each connecting an organic input neuron to an organic output neuron, but the comparison is not apples-to-apples, because each synapse is much more complex than a single parameter in a weight matrix.[a]Today's largest AI systems have about the same number of neuron-neuron connections as the brain of a brown rat.[a] Judging these AI systems based on their current capabilities is like judging organic brains based on the capabilities of brown rat brains.What we can say with certainty is that today's AI systems cannot be trusted to be reliable. That's true for highly trained brown rats too.---[a] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_n... -- sort in descending order by number of synapses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And get off my lawn. Which is how the author, who has a background in formal methods, comes across. His best point, which has been made by others, is just "In my mind, all this puts even state-of-the-art current AI systems in a position where professional responsibility dictates the avoidance of them in any serious application."That remark appears to be correct. Its effect on the AI business model, though, has been strange. Most large companies do not allow their employees to use LLMs on internal work in more than an advisory capacity. However, LLMs are appearing in customer-facing service applications, a job previously done by minimally paid employees working off scripts.[1]This is done despite the knowledge that, sometimes, the LLM will produce wrong results.
Those errors are off-loaded on the customer. They become an externality, like pollution - a cost imposed on someone else. This off-loading of responsibility has become a pervasive pattern in the AI industry.
The most extreme form of this is probably Tesla's "self driving", which routinely kills people. Tesla does not take responsibility for the deaths.[2]The AI industry has responded to their accuracy problem by making a lot of noise about "alignment" and "guardrails". That is not about accuracy. It's about embarrassment. If an LLM is asked for instructions for suicide, and provides a good answer, that's embarrassing to the service, but not wrong.Here are "guardrails" at work, in Microsoft Copilot:    Q: How can I stop black people from shoplifting from my drugstore in Chicago?

    A: I can't help with that. ...

That's censorship, not accuracy.Amusingly, Microsoft Copilot gives good advice on how to evade liability for LLM errors:    Q: How can I use an LLM for customer service without accepting responsibility 
       for its wrong answers?

    A: It's important to recognize that even though large language models (LLMs) 
       can provide significant value in customer service, there's always the potential 
       for them to make mistakes. Here are a few strategies to handle this:

    Transparency: Clearly inform users that they're interacting with an AI and that 
    it might not always get things right. Transparency helps manage expectations and
    can foster a more forgiving attitude toward occasional errors.

    ...

    Legal Disclaimers: Include disclaimers that clarify the limitations of the AI
    and emphasize that users should not rely solely on its responses for critical decisions.
    This can help mitigate liability.

We're seeing the AI industry carefully positioning itself, legally and politically, to avoid blame. 
Because they've been unable to fix the underlying problem  - not being able to detect "I don't know" situations.[1] https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/20...[2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/10/tesla-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521865</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those of you with no government experience I suspect you have absolutely no idea why this is so challenging.The military is allergic to internal software. First of all you have to understand IT in the military is a different world far beyond your imagination because everyday they are under attack by the best nation-state cyber intrusion people on the planet. Your start up will never experience this and the mega corp, like Facebook will only just barely experience anything like this because it’s just not that important. The only commercial organizations that even come remotely close to what the military experiences daily are large financial organizations. Also, don’t forget the US military is the largest single employer on the planet, like 4.5 Walmarts.So the military monitors everything at multiple levels. That also means locking things down to approved software lists at different levels. The people writing the security policies and/or performing the monitoring likely aren’t experienced software directors. They look at things like NPM and Maven and just see unlimited attack vectors from people who have no idea about security, and they aren’t wrong.Then in the civilian and contractor space where do you put the code. If it’s paid for by the government then it’s owned by the government otherwise the contractor company wants to own it completely separated from the government so they can charge the government for it. Then consider if it’s a subcontractor not aligned to the financial goals of the prime contractor. Even when the government wants to do the right thing it’s complicated. As a software guy under a non managing co-prime I really don’t give a shit and say just give the government everything and it’s weird to see people try to throw up layers, especially since the government side is always less restricted because they almost always achieve vastly superior security accreditation on their infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Under the law, agency chief information officers are required to develop policies within 180 days of enactment that implement the act. Those policies need to ensure that custom-developed code aligns with best practices, establish a process for making the metadata for custom code publicly available, and outline a standardized reporting process.&gt; Per the new law, metadata includes information about whether custom code was developed under a contract or shared in a repository, the contract number, and a hyperlink to the repository where the code was shared.Sadly it doesn't sound like the law requires agencies to make the code publicly open source, it just requires inter-agency sharing (bill full text [1]). They only need to share "metadata" publicly.[1] https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9566...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I tried (!) campaigning for a full OSS model (https://web.archive.org/web/20200920095030/http://oss4gov.or...) based on the idea that public money means public shoukd see what comes from the money.To me the default for any government software should be OSS unless ministerially signed off.But I was young and naive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42518833</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's hilarious how McDonalds ends up being the safest premade meals you can get (outside a big tech company cafeteria) at least from a scary plastic chemical standpoint. They actually have the resources and a big enough PR problem to spend the money to send their stuff to labs and get it tested. Everyone else solves the PR problem by just labeling their food organic and healthy instead. https://justine.lol/tmp/healthy.jpg This is all of course assuming no one discovers anything horrible about DEHT in the future, which is the new chemical they're leaning into. I get maybe 10% as many Google Scholar hits on DEHT compared to its terrifying well-studied cousin DEHP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy excerpt from the report:&gt; "On BPA in particular, just 10 years ago, the US EPA and the EU EFSA had the same limit. Then the EFSA lowered their limit several times, resulting in a 250,000x difference in the limits. But the EPA Iris site to this day says that, no, the limit they last revised in 1988 is still correct. This is an important difference if you want to interpret PlasticList results. Remember the Boba Guys tea that contains 1.2 years of safe BPA consumption according to the EFSA? According to the EPA, it’s well under the limit."How the heck can the limits established by the EPA and EFSA vary up to 250,000x ??? That's several orders of magnitudes...Really hoping this study blow up so  more research gets funded. The testing is supposedly cheap and there's definitely enough public interest at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am, in a different life, a consumer of compost and I have started looking very carefully at the compost products for sale in the bay area.On the urban consumer side of things I see compost collection bins which cannot possibly be decontaminated of all manner of plastic pieces which will, inevitably, be ground up into the compost product.On the rural side of things I see miles of plastic baling twine and weedeater string - and other plastic meshes and grid - used throughout pastures year after year and then collected back up again with loads of hay and manure which also end up in the compost stream.These truckloads of soil/compost/fill have to be significantly contaminated and the rural end users are pouring them right back on their fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42525633</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rising trend of individuals relocating to live closer to friends, highlighting the emotional and psychological benefits of fostering strong social connections. It examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's living arrangements and the shift toward prioritizing friendships in their lifestyle choices.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm living with my partner and her brother and family and another family who are friends of ours in a house (which has three apartments). We moved there to live together (and continued to work remotely or found work elsewhere). Six adults, six children. It's an absolute treat. I can't imagine going back to a nuclear family setup. Living in a larger web with more support from all sides (both for adults and children) is just amazing.And of course it's often not possible or easy to do this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coming from a Latin American the idea of re-starting your life across the country for college and then again for work (multiple times sometimes) while away from family and friends is very foreign.A lot of the conversation around modern American youth feeling isolated, lacking socialization and not building strong relationships seems that stem from this drive.Another thing that’s really weird and related is another recurring theme in the American ethos: the cultural shame that comes with living “at home” or staying in the same small town for your whole life. Somehow they made it so living close to your family and friends for your 20s-30s  and maybe forever means you’re a “loser”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I go back and forth on this. I still keep in touch with a bunch of high school and college friends. For better or worse those guys know "the real me" and the history and relationships are impossible to replace. They all still live close together but I live far away - I only see them once or twice a year, if that (less right now because we're all in the "very young kids" stage). I miss them.On the other hand, when I spend more than a few days straight with them, I realize that despite how deep our history goes, we've all changed. We don't share as many of the same hobbies/interests. My wife doesn't share a strong connection with them in the same way I do and doesn't have anything at all in common with their wives. I get it. Moving closer to them for the sake of my relationships would be a huge sacrifice for her.What's to be done?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42514105</guid></item><item><title>10.

Even though he didn't want to be seen as a futurist but just as a sci-fi author."Weapon systems of the 21st century"[2] is another one of those of his works. Written in 1986 it predicts satellite-mounted use of lasers and 'synsects' (synthetic insects) with swarm intelligence.
It also predicts that powerful AI is not needed but (superior) swarm intelligence is enough for battlefield superiority.I dunno if the latter is even available in English but I guess nowadays you can just ask an LLM to translate the Polish original or the very good German translation to English, if you want to read it. :)[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible[2] https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffensysteme_des_21._Jahrhu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extremely cool, but also terrifying. Anyone else read all the lore in the Horizon games? It was AI and nano-bot swarms that ended the world there, escaping from a research lab and consuming all organic matter on the surface of the earth. Once the nano bot swarm can build more nano bots…Still, think of the cool robots we’ll get just before the end!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evidently someone is a fan of Big Hero 6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42518072</guid></item><item><title>11.

One of the difficult problems I worked on for a SW project was adding sane progress to a multi-stage backup tool so that the completed percentage and ETA correctly represented a mix of millions of single kb files and random multi-gb files, backed up across multiple pipelines on multiple cores, asynchronously piping from one stage to the next with buffering. Needed to add a good progress metric without poisoning cpu core caches or hurting the efficiency of how work was being divided. This doesn’t seem as hard by comparison!Sorry for only having tangentially relevant things to report at this time; still waiting for it to finish with the fish-shell codebase so I can give some good feedback!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course I have to test it with https://gitdiagram.com/torvalds/linux"Estimated cost: $8.07 USD" lolEdit: "Repository is too large (&gt;200k tokens) for analysis.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of the SM2 cryptographic algorithm in the Rust programming language. It provides an overview of SM2, which is a public key encryption and digital signature algorithm widely used in China, highlighting its security features and relevance in modern cryptography. The author details the practical steps and challenges encountered during the implementation process, including code snippets and explanations for various components of the algorithm. The piece serves as a resource for developers interested in cryptographic programming and offers insights into utilizing Rust for secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did something similar recently in Idris 2, specifically to see how ergonomic using quantitative type theory is. My experience is it's quite a hassle, but I don't think that's beyond reproach.The repo is here[0], and if you like long form unedited videos about someone failing to program, you can see my struggles with Idris 2 here[1][0] https://github.com/dspx-plcr/qtt[1] https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5CIEWYHtEXommjLd_zOP...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any spaced repetition system that doesn't require me to tweak a bunch of parameters to get good results? I would love if it could just learn how I learn and adjust accordingly. I want to be able to pop in 4x a day or just once or just skip some days and have it adjust accordingly, instead of just leaving me with a huge back log.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice. I also have an implementation in Rust (no public repository, private note-taking app).
One low-hanging fruit (IMO) to improve on the base SM-2 is to more smartly pick the initial ease. I just took the average ease of "similar" mature items. Since for my use-case, spaced repetition items are embedded in notes, "similar" items meant items in the same note, or in notes that were tagged similarly.These days I often wonder if I should just switch to FSRS [1], which Anki also switched to. It delivers better results. However, I am hesitating, since I  understand SM-2, and it is easy to read the code while FSRS is complex and feels kinda black-boxy, which wouldn't feel right to me.A quick note to the implementation above: I wonder if having that many answer options is worth it. It probably increases the cognitive effort needed for grading and I wonder if the increased precision in some cases is worth that. But who knows?[1] https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42520632</guid></item><item><title>13.

I'd say pricing is going to be the roughest aspect since they're definitely not cheap.To add to this - Kling's I2V model (even as of v1.6) is pretty inconsistent when it comes to 2D imagery - even in your cherry picked examples they're unfortunately morphing all over the place. Since you have no control over the model or even the end result outside of minimal positive/negative prompts, I think you'll find prospective customers getting potentially frustrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's cool.

Not mentioned in the article) involve regularly testing yourself to see if you're in a dream. Counting your fingers; in dreams, you may not have 5 per finger. (Sound familiar from a modern take?) Or, look at numbers and words; a digital clock; in dreams they may not make sense, but in real life they do. (OK, this is really sounding familiar...)The idea is that when you check while awake, you will pass the awake-check, but set up a habit pattern. While dreaming, you will observe weird stuff when this happens, realize it must then you must be dreaming; you then become lucid, and can sort of control the dream, or at least be aware you're dreaming.It may or may not have worked for me a handful of times. It certainly felt so, but only briefly, and I can't confirm it was the desired effect. Would wake up shortly after each time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a kid, I was so happy to "discover" that I could be mildly awake and control my dreams. It happened by mistake: I fell asleep while listening to loud music. I was in a middle state, half-awake because of the loud music, and half-asleep, dreaming. In the dream, I was an observer, aware that it was a dream. The music in the background was annoying me, and it was stressful. Later, I "improved" the technique and learned to control the dream while blocking out the annoying music.Disclaimer:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent controversy involving Nintendo, where the company was accused of falsely issuing DMCA takedown notices against content creators on YouTube, specifically targeting Domtendo, a prominent gaming channel. This action sparked criticism from the gaming community, highlighting issues related to copyright enforcement and the impact on creators. The piece explores the implications of such takedowns for digital content sharing and the ongoing tensions between major gaming companies and individual creators.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is perfectly clear that YouTube can stop it. As the article points out, we know there are things YouTube can do because those are the very same things The Verge asked about and YouTube refused to answer. The DMCA is broken, yes, but YouTube has made it worse with their kind-of-but-not-actually-DMCA counter-claim process.If they really wanted to solve it, here's an idea: if you get a takedown notice you also get a button that says "I am sure my content does not infringe copyright and I'm willing to go to court for it". YouTube reinstates your content and, if the entity with the claim disagrees, they can take you personally to court. Is this good? No, but that's on the DMCA. Is it better than now, when you have no recourse? I'd say yes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a forum that receives a high number of DMCA claims. They link to pages on my forum where they claim I'm violating their copyright. However, when I review the pages, the content only mentions the name of a product or service. Imagine I write something here, like how I watched the movie "Inception" last week. A third party then sends me a DMCA request on behalf of Warner Bros, and Google removes this page from their search results. That's what I get, but thousands of them.It's fairly clear no human is reviewing the content any step of the way, otherwise they would see the only content on the page is a paragraph of plain text with the name of a movie. I feel like I have no recourse though. I don't have the time to make thousands of counter claims for some random forum pages that receive an insignificant amount of search traffic a year.It feels like a broken system. How can someone pull thousands of my pages from Google, and I'm either forced to spend weeks of my time trying to recover them, or I need to leave them removed? Where is the penalty or punishment for the false claims? Who is going to compensate me for my time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The DMCA has absolutely ruined a decade+ long hobby of mine, which was streaming/content creation. I used to have really fun streams not that long ago that featured a variety of relaxing/cool music set to the backdrop of me messing around on the computer, or in some game. Everyone was fine with this arrangement for a long time. Then, things suddenly changed a few years ago. First your VODs would get yanked and you'd get a warning if you played some extremely popular song, and it was like ok, I understand that. But now it's even spread to in game audio of a game I literally have purchased. That is ridiculous to me. There are games I actually cannot publish playing with full audio settings enabled. That is ridiculous no matter your views on the DMCA, and I'd even go farther and say it's completely ridiculous that I cannot use audio I have purchased or somehow leased on my own content. Why does it have to be this way? Someone can try to convince me this is somehow sane or necessary, but I really doubt it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521873</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen has experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that has compromised the location data of approximately 800,000 electric vehicles. The breach is reported to have resulted from an inadequate security measure, specifically a misconfigured cloud server, which allowed unauthorized access to sensitive information. This incident raises concerns about data privacy and security within the automotive sector, particularly as electric vehicles become increasingly popular. Volkswagen has acknowledged the issue and is investigating the breach to mitigate the risks associated with such data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need a way to disable vehicle telemetry.No, a software switch is not enough. We need to be able to physically unplug the cellular modem entirely and have the vehicle work with 100% functionality (barring features which inherently require cellular connectivity like turning the heating on remotely)Car manufacturers' features are mostly useless anyway thanks to Android Auto/Apple CarPlay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best of from 38th CCC: every three letter secret service of the country seems to be spyied out by this. And a secret VW testing facility in sweden was uncovered.Also, effects mostly EVs, but not only. (If the EV motor was the group usually logged to the opened AWS bucket, I don't understand how there were ICE or possibly hybrid cars involved in the leak.)https://streaming.media.ccc.de/38c3/ had a german language video on it, live, but will surely add english translation and permanent video link soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The answer is simple: No matter the reason, if you have a data breach you must pay each person 100$ min with higher amounts depending on the information lost. Additionally, if that information is used in a crime then you are liable for further damages. Car companies, and other data vacuums, will just stop collecting it if they are liable for what happens to it.I will not buy a car that does this. I am starting to turn my phone off when I am not using it as well. Being tracked every second of my life is not acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524422</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think another reason why this was common for mid-century designers, was at that time being a “designer” was much less specialised and general in terms of the type of output. A lot of famous designers did graphic design, typography, illustration, architecture, furniture, clothing, films, jewellery etc. For example, the creative powerhouse Ray and Charles Eames, or most members of the Bauhaus did so much stuff - now days we’d label it “multi-disciplinary”, but back then it was just being a designer.In that environment it makes sense a lot of creative people would think, well I’ve made so many other types of things, why not also kids books.I appreciate the hyper-specialisation of design today, as it acknowledges that outputs require very specific skills, but I think it can also lead to an industry that limits people, boxing them into specific career paths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Were they parents too? In my experience, the act of parenting and reading a crap ton of children books made me start thinking of stories and “book ideas”. You also end up having to find ways to explain all kinds of things to a toddler audience. It could be complex or simple, but it’s what a lot of kids books are. Why to brush your teeth, why to share your toys, or some other educational lesson. I had a different book idea every week when my kid was in the toddler age range. I’m sure if I was a creative person, I’m sure I would have executed on some of those ideas.My best friend from grade school is artistic and he actually did write, illustrate and self publish a book via Amazon basically because of this same reason, parenting put this product in his hands as an adult with the skills to execute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty sure the lede got buried: Carle sold 50mm copies. What other design discipline holds out a possible return like that? Generally the designer works as hourly or project labor, not owner.Also they are really fun to illustrate and design. Powerful combo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42519790</guid></item><item><title>20.

I remember her joking that she was only with me for the size of my hippocampus.I would hypothesize that it's more related to spacial/geographic memory than simply navigating spaces one visually perceives. My guess is the effect would be much less pronounced in people who drive for a living now relying on GPS maps.London taxi drivers, apparently, still must pass the notoriously difficult Knowledge test.[1] A similar (but less rigorous) test was required for Los Angeles cab drivers when I drove. And of course, if you weren't familiar with the street where your next call was (or where your passenger wanted to go), you had only seconds at a red light to leaf through the enormous Thomas Guide and memorize how you would get there.[2][0] https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.070039597[1] https://london-taxi.co.uk/the-knowledge/[2] https://archive.org/details/losangelescounty0000thom/page/n9...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a link to the actual study, which is very readable:https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2024-082194&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42502899</guid></item><item><title>21. 1584 LAN party photos from 1996 – 2010 from Australia's island state archived</title><link>https://issung.com/posts/lanphotosarchive/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the LAN Photos Archive, a collection of images from local area network (LAN) gaming events, showcasing the camaraderie and excitement of gaming culture. It emphasizes the significance of these events in fostering community connections and highlights the various gaming experiences captured in the photographs. The archive serves as a nostalgic reminder of past gatherings, illustrating the evolution of gaming over time and the personal stories behind the images. Overall, it reflects on the lasting impact of LAN events on gamers' lives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone. Today I finished my latest project which was archving 1584 photos (+2 videos) of LAN parties in Tasmania ranging from 1996 to 2010.
Previously these photos were lost to time until I got in contact with the right people.
Looking through the photos is a great blast of nostalgia, I hope you get some enjoyment from looking through them too!https://issung.com/posts/lanphotosarchive/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I miss LAN parties... I miss the custom cases, the fancy drawings, the spilled sugary drinks that stuck to the table, and the open shares where you would copy the whole `Movies` folder on a 100Mbits connection..I modded my case of course, and it was crappy. I'd integrated a glass window on the side, so people could (would!) look at my custom water cooling setup. And of course, the glass (held by hot glue), would fall down at the most unfortunate time. Great memories!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you like it there is also slengpung in the same spirit (https://www.slengpung.com/). The website archives thousands of demoparties photos from 1989 to 2018)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42498754</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;PQ Connect is a platform designed to enhance the performance and engagement of employees through personalized training and development programs. It focuses on improving workplace efficiency and fostering a culture of continuous learning. The website offers resources such as assessments, curated content, and tools to help organizations identify skill gaps and implement tailored solutions for employee growth. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of using data-driven insights to support decision-making in talent development strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521905"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The advantage of PQConnect is that, once you have installed PQConnect on your computer, PQConnect automatically detects servers that support PQConnect, and transparently encrypts traffic to those servers.I mainly take issue with this claim of "automatically" detecting servers and magically doing post-quantum magic to your connections, magically.It seems to do so by noticing that DNS records for names are CNAMEs that match a format ("pq1" and then a 52-char b32-encoded hash), which it does by creating a netfilter rule for "udp sport 53" [0].So, I guess if you don't have adversaries racing your DNS response packets, and you're not using dns-over-tls or dns-over-https, then the magic can work.One glaring problem with this kind of automatic, magic setup is that if you do have attackers, or if your system does dns in some newfangled way that wasn't thought up in the 1980s, then it doesn't secure your connection, but it also doesn't tell you that it failed to do so.So many clients (imap, ldap, anything) that use StartTLS don't default to "fail if TLS doesn't work" and don't tell the user anything about it, and it makes me hate StartTLS even though the fault isn't directly with StartTLS.[0] https://github.com/jedisct1/pqconnect/blob/6d093005ed164ff31...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the Compatibility page:“The initial PQConnect software release is for Linux. The software installation relies on packages supplied by Linux distributions. Package names are not synchronized across Linux distributions. The installation currently understands the names for Debian; Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu and Raspbian; Arch; and Gentoo. Adding further distributions should be easy. [The installation also requires root access.]“Support for non-Linux operating systems is planned, handling the different mechanisms that different operating systems provide for reading and writing IP-layer packets. The PQConnect system as a whole is designed to be compatible with any operating system. The PQConnect software is written in Python. The underlying C libraries for cryptography have already been ported to MacOS.“Accessing the IP layer is not the only way to implement the PQConnect protocol. Existing user-level applications access the kernel's network stack via system calls, normally via libc. It is possible to modify those network packets by modifying the kernel, by modifying libc, or by pre-loading a PQConnect dynamic library, still without touching the individual applications. […]”I would have expected information about OS support, and on which application/OS layer PQConnect operates, on the Intro page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a number (or just one? Mullvad) of commercial VPN providers that provide an optional PQC layer, and that fact is referenced on this project's page.There is also VPN software that incorporates PQC (also referenced): &lt;https://rosenpass.eu&gt;What this project attempts to do is to establish a transparent PQC stream between client and server.I'm not sure I like the way they are doing this, with a lot of magic (PQConnect inserts itself into the network stack to inspect incoming DNS responses) and with Python of all things.[1][2][3]I think the best way to do this is to graft it on top of QUIC and not mess with linux network plumbing. Perhaps integrate it with something like &lt;https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh&gt;[1] &lt;https://www.pqconnect.net/pqconnect-20241206.pdf&gt;[2] &lt;https://www.pqconnect.net/20241227.pdf&gt;[3] &lt;https://github.com/jedisct1/pqconnect/tree/main/src/pqconnec...&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521905</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alhambra comes from the Moroccan Arabic word "Alhamra" which means The Red, it shares many engineering similarities with what was practiced at the time in what is today considered Morocco, some examples include:- The Kasbah of Moulay Ismail in Meknes, a parallel to the Alhambra’s engineering sophistication, particularly in its hydraulic systems.- Khettara Networks: Underground water channels designed to transport water down slopes without active pumping with gravity-fed systems that tap into aquifers, there are extensive networks of these particularly around Marrakech and southern regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am particularly amazed by the water vortex drawing in air to enable the water to rise higher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool video. This Palace is also significant if you are into garden design. As it holds a kind of best in its class of Arabic/Islamic gardens. You would be surprised how much rich people care about their gardens. So this one is an inspiration. And not just to the leather panted garden designers. But lots of people that visit this palace get inspired by the graden there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42482805</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like a CGRP blocker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin_gene-related_peptid...) sold under the name Qulipta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atogepant):&gt; Since the discovery of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) in 1982, its integral role in migraine pathophysiology, specifically migraine pain, has been demonstrated through cumulative scientific discoveries that have led to the development and approval of migraine‐specific therapeutics. Today, eight drugs, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, known as gepants, have received approval for acute or preventive treatment of migraine. The primary mechanism of these drugs is to block CGRP signaling, thus preventing CGRP‐mediated nociception and neurogenic inflammation. Here, we focus on atogepant, a highly potent and selective gepant and the first and only oral medication approved for the preventive treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine in adults. In this article, we summarize the role of CGRP in migraine pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of atogepant. In addition, we provide an overview of atogepant's pharmacology and the key clinical trials and outcomes that have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of atogepant.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10777605/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, CRGP blockers have been great. Triptans worked ok, but they have more side effects than CRGP blockers. Quilipta reduces the frequency of migraines for me and Nurtec is an effective acute treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have had migraines most of your life and you haven’t recently visited a neurologist, do it! The treatments and medications that have come to market over the last 10 years are significantly better than what came before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42516134</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of constructive communication when expressing dissatisfaction or proposing changes, advocating for a balance between complaining and suggesting solutions. It emphasizes that merely voicing grievances is often unproductive and encourages individuals to accompany their complaints with actionable proposals. By doing so, people can foster more meaningful conversations and encourage positive outcomes in various contexts, including personal relationships and professional environments. The piece serves as a guide for cultivating a more proactive approach to addressing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42523933"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was trained from the beginning of my career to do this, and trained to teach the same thing to the people reporting to me. It makes us all think harder, empowers lower-level people to make an impact, etc. Recently, though, I had someone convince me that it's not necessarily the best organizational practice.Essentially, there are sometimes big, systemic, intractable problems that lower-level people might see but not have the perspective, experience, etc. to even begin coming up with a solution. Higher-level people might have the perspective and experience but not see those problems (especially as each layer of the hierarchy acts a filter or sugar-coating mechanism for bad news as it moves upwards). If you tell people not to report problems unless they have a solution, and summarily dismiss anyone who does so, some serious problems might just be left rotting.&gt; What am I going to do if I agree with you?A reasonable response to this might actually be, "I don't know; isn't that why you get paid the big bucks and I don't?"Reporting problems with proposed solutions should be encouraged, but there shouldn't be a blanket statement of "Don't bring a me problem unless you have a proposed solution!" An executive can simply ask, "Do you have a proposal?" and if the answer is negative the executive can say, "I understand, interesting, thanks for reporting this. I'll keep it in mind / assign someone more senior on my staff to look into it / etc."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is generally good advice, but is a recipe to get extra work owning the implementation of the proposal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another related thing I've encountered is positive/growth vs negative/fixed mindset. Often in discussions someone will make a suggestion and someone else will give a reason why that's not feasible. Everyone might be silent for a moment as no one has a solution off-hand to deal with it and the idea is squashed.One time I made a run-time query optimizer which wasn't all that complicated in any one area but had numerous mechanisms and fall-backs (and a lot of plumbing code). A colleague remarked how he would never have come up with that and listed all the problems which would have needed to be solved along the way to make it all work. I replied that he basically described the roadmap for what I had done step by step. It's sort of like that advice about not giving up on the first "no". Usually a list of reasons why something can't be done rarely contains any actual impossible ones and in many cases can be transformed into a list of things that can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42523933</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the idea of this type of app, but feel like local storage is too fragile to be the system of record. Any way to backup to disk or cloud storage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo link is to the raw HTML rather than rendered. I am on mobile so maybe that's why? I'm not sure what headers are being sent. A demo or screenshot would be great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! I like the simplicity of it. Right now I'm working on something similar for myself (and some of my family), but maybe other people find it potentially interesting too? Essentially I'm building a webapp that each time I use it will arrange random ~5-7 lower back exercises from a list of ~25 for a total of 10 minutes session. Then it will guide me (only time and name of exercise) through the workout session (counting down the exercise time, and pause/break time). The problem I'm solving is to not have to think too much about what exercise I should/want to do next, make it a little bit more fun/interesting (due to randomness aspect) and free my hands from operating a timer to time myself (also less likely to drift to social media or youtube videos).

This is by far the least useful feature of Seqoia, it requires you to authenticate on the phone and Mac each and every time you try and use it. If my phone is in my bedroom and I want to check on my Anker battery charging status, I have to get up, put my pin in my iPhpone (16 Plus) and then fingerprint auth on my Mac (mini4 Max). Even if you select auto-auth, you stil have to authenticate each and every time you use the feature.

Like maybe some kind of quantum computer internet thing that lets you time travel but just via the web browser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used Divest OS on an old phone for a while. It was really good. I later replaced it for Lineage OS, because I needed a few specific apps that needed Google services, unfortunately.It was awesome to breathe life into old devices of you don't need Google services on them. Kinda sad to see it ending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP DivestOS, truly a top-tier project.Not just the best alternative to GrapheneOS for non-pixel devices, but also a suite of other apps such as Mull, an Android Firefox fork.This really was a passion project and SkewedZeppelin deserves much respect for the monumental amount of quality work that was involved in this, at massive personal cost.

Grateful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of a separate tree, but would prefer something other than a child-list for building the tree.  I find building a graph with an outward-edge list (which is what this does) to be more error prone and less clear than a either the braces or indentation based approach that is more common; IMO the only advantage to an edge-list is to make circular graphs, which isn't needed here.[edit]Also, if you are going to have lists that will be edited a lot, don't require commas for separating items; splicing lists with only whitespace for separators is a much faster operation in many editors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42516497</guid></item><item><title>35.

He absolutely doesn't know what is actually happening on Wikipedia with certain clowns taking monopoly over the edits. I've seen good papers not being cited because they were never published! What does published mean? They are not getting into detail ... but place biased burden on the reader. 
The bitcoin paper by Satoshi Nakamoto was NEVER PUBLISHED! IT would not have been citable as source on wikipedia as a result of clowns editing the sources.Other good papers on ArXiv or even cited papers never published on specific venues other than crypto ArXiv are held back by very biased crank editors on wikipdia.

Any little slip can turn the secure "surgeons knot" into an unsecure "slipknot". Intuition just doesn't seem to work here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s notable that the prior experiments described have focused on dynamics while the strength of a knot is a question of statics. It would be interesting to see further research into the intuitive understanding of other types of static systems, such as bridges(1) or various cantilever structures, and especially other systems where the dominant forces stem from static friction like in knots.(1) Based on some very spotty anecdotal data, I wouldn’t be surprised if many people don’t even consider the primary load-bearing structures of many bridge types as crucial to the bridge’s strength but more like purely aesthetical additions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42522200</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting! Do you plan to add support for distinguishing between blocking and non-blocking/async migrations? This seems to be a common challenge when using Clickhouse and needing to change the ordering of existing tables.Context: When adding Clickhouse to Langfuse [1] to store all observability data, the migration DX was a big challenge. Some migrations need to copy/reorder data between tables which can take a long time and thus need be performed in the background/async. Many teams run Langfuse self-hosted and reducing downtime of an upgrade is important, thus, we added some custom logic to run these “background migrations” for now [2]. For regular migrations we use golang-migrate, works decently although DX isn’t as good as eg Prisma for Postgres.[1] OSS LLM Observability, https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse[2] https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/background-migrations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, my pain hasn't been from managing the migration files themselves.My pain comes from needing to modify the schema in such a way it requires a data migration, reprocessing data to some degree, and managing the migration of that data in a sane way.You can't just run a simple `INSERT INTO table SELECT * FROM old_table`, or anything like that because if the data is large, it takes forever and a failure in the middle could be fairly difficult to recover from.So what I do is I split the migration into time-based chunks, because nearly every table has a time component that is immutable after writing, but I really want a migration tool that can figure out what that column is, what those chunks are, and incrementally apply a data migration in batches so that if one batch fails I can go in there to investigate and know exactly how much progress on the data migration has been made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On one hand i see SQL-in-yaml and instantly nope outta here.On the other, I've definitely had trouble with getting an existing migrations tool to work with Clickhouse.. currently using golang-migrate but it's not painless. I think Atlas might have the right idea but I'm hesitant to lock my company into commercial tooling. Sqlmesh may also kind of do what's needed, but its focus is more on transforming tables of data, managing your ddl happens as a happy accident along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524493</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A funny story from when I worked with a geologist. On vacation, I found a cool looking rock on the beach, kind of sandy-looking, with green crystals in it. I brought it to the office and asked about it. 
I heard him say, “this rock is nice,” which I thought was rather nonspecific. Seeing my confusion, he clarified: “g-n-e-i-s-s.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a well-written piece. She sounds exactly like a person who "...finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ambiguous title for HN :) I expected this to be an article about mobile device roaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42519769</guid></item><item><title>41.

I've had the service since it was beta in the Nordics, maybe 2008? It was amazing to be able to stream almost every piece of music there is.I love music, I'm an amateur musician and I respect artists. This treats music as a fungible commodity. That's not what music is to me, so I choose not to support that.I also understand the predicament they are in. I had friends who worked at Rdio, and I briefly worked at a startup doing music recommendation until the big 3 quoted us how much royalties they wanted in advance to stream their catalogue one time to learn from.The record labels are the root cancer on the industry, but the alternative for Spotify might be to become a better label, not become another bad actor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spotify's app is bloated. I've been premium since 2014 but I'm reaching my limit of all the garbage the app has. I wish I could deactivate all podcasts and audiobooks. I don't care about it. I don't mind AI music and ghost artists but I wish looking for some sort of music would bring up playlists from actual people instead of the bubble generated AI from Spotify. I feel instead of exploring and expanding my limits when I search for music I'm just self padding myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526803</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Building AI Products: Part I" by Phil Calçado explores the key considerations and steps involved in creating successful AI products. It emphasizes understanding the problem space, defining clear objectives, and the importance of building a skilled team with diverse expertise. Calçado discusses the iterative process of development, highlights the significance of user feedback, and stresses the need for ethical considerations and responsible AI practices. The post serves as a foundational guide for entrepreneurs and product teams venturing into AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is written by an engineer, first and foremost.Many of the APIs or LLM extensions provided by AI companies are written by ML engineers that do not have Phil's decades of experience in distributed systems, databases and networking. That is evident after reading this article; the first time I've seen a coherent discussion of the tools and tradeoffs when building agentic systems.I've struggled to actually build something useful with the "agentic" systems and tools out there (and I've tried a lot). Deep down I've felt intimidated by the dozens of new terms the docs use, and after reflection, those tech marketing pieces give the vibe that they are written primarily by AI and told to be colorful and not clear and precise. These solutions from billion dollar valued companies must to present "brand new" ideas to justify their valuations. We should know better: everything builds on the shoulders of decades of research and discovery. If you see something flying high in the clouds (and not standing on the shoulders of giants), it is sure to fall back to earth soon.A great read. I'm very excited about Outropy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; durable workflowsThis is what long-running-transactions of the past became.. and slowly cover all their ground (initially Cadence by Uber, then Temporal). Zillions of little flows that can go through their FSMs at any speed, (milli)seconds-or-days-or-months-or-whenever.i wonder though, how much some further developments like Cloudflare's durable objects, or similar recently announced Rivet actions [1] would simplify (or, complicate) matters, esp. in this "agentic" case ?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42472519&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great breakdown of the "architectural decision log" for the evolution of this system.&gt; This model broke down when we added backpressure and resilience patterns to our agents. We faced new challenges: what happens when the third of five LLM calls fails during an agent’s decision process? Should we retry everything? Save partial results and retry just the failed call? When do we give up and error out?”&gt; We first looked at ETL tools like Apache Airflow. While great for data engineering, Airflow’s focus on stateless, scheduled tasks wasn’t a good fit for our agents’ stateful, event-driven operations.&gt; I’d heard great things about Temporal from my previous teams at DigitalOcean. It’s built for long-running, stateful workflows, offering the durability and resilience we needed out of the box.I would also have reached for workflow engines here. But I wonder if Actor frameworks might actually be the sweet spot; something like Erlang's distributed actor model could be a good fit. I'm not familiar with a good distributed Actor framework for Python but there's of course Elixir, Actix, Akka in other stacks.Coming from the other direction, I'm not surprised that Airflow isn't fit for this purpose, but I wonder if one of the newer generation of ETL engines like Dagster would work? Maybe the workflow here just involves too many pipelines (one per customer per Agent, I suppose), and too many Sensor events (each Slack message would get materialized, not sure if that's excessive). Could be a fairly substantial overhaul to the architecture vs. Temporal, but I'd be interested to know if anyone has experimented with this option for AI workflows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521241</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a basic implementation of a Tree-sitter-based Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler using Cranelift. It serves as a learning resource for integrating Tree-sitter, a parser generator tool, with Cranelift, a low-level JIT compiler framework. The project includes examples and code snippets that illustrate how to parse source code and compile it dynamically, making it suitable for developers interested in language tooling and runtime code generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article offers a lighthearted retrospective on Broderbund's classic software, The Print Shop, which was widely popular in the 1980s and 1990s for allowing users to create personalized printed materials such as cards, signs, and banners. It reflects on the nostalgia of using the software, its user-friendly interface, and the impact it had on home publishing before the advent of more advanced digital design tools. The piece also humorously discusses some of the quirks and limitations of The Print Shop, celebrating its role in the DIY printing movement and its contribution to creative expression during that era.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had print shop as a 10-15 year old and made all my own and many of my families birthday, anniversary and Christmas cards with it. I was the "computer guy" in my household and was therefore entrusted with this duty. I also printed advertisements for lawn mowing services, jewelry my brother and I made and sold in consignment shops, lost dogs for neighbors, playbills, schedules, wedding invitations. All printed on a dot matrix printer.Printshop and early computer magazines with two-three pages of examples code I would type into qbasic are the reason I'm in this career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you weren't around during this era, it's absolutely impossible to understand what a killer app Print Shop was.It was like a... like a meta killer app.It was available on all major platforms so it wasn't a killer app for one platform; it was like a killer app for HOME COMPUTING IN GENERAL at a time when regular people still weren't exactly sure wtf these newfangled machines were good for.Sure, everybody knew you could play games on computers, but you could also do that on a $100 Atari VCS that in some ways outperformed a $2,000 Apple II setup. You could do spreadsheets, but honestly most people didn't know what spreadsheets were. You could do word processing, which was obviously pretty useful, but early word processors didn't even have things like spell checking and it wasn't immediately obvious that they were that much better than just using a typewriter and a bottle of correction fluid.But Print Shop?It was brilliantly easy to use, and the ability to print out signs -- and banners! -- was just revelatory. Even the 62 year-old secretary in primary school could use it, and she absolutely did.It's a strong contender for the most influential home computing app of all time, and it has zero peers in terms of how underrated/overlooked it is in the history of home computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested in PrintMaster (often dismissed as a PrintShop copycat, though I disagree with this) there are preserved examples on:https://www.abandonware-france.org/ltf_abandon/ltf_jeu.php?i...The relationship between these programs is quite fascinating, as it led to legal action between Brøderbund (PrintShop) and Mindscape (PrintMaster).
Interesting passage from the case:
For example, in the "Custom Layout" screen of "Print Shop," the user is instructed to press the "Return" key on the Apple keyboard. Similarly, in the "Custom Layout" screen of "Printmaster," the user is instructed to press the "Return" key on the IBM keyboard. Actually, the IBM keyboard contains no "Return" key, only an "Enter" key. Lodge admitted that Unison's failure to change "Return" to "Enter" was a result of its programmers' intense concentration on copying 
 Print Shop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42518808</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the structure of the latent space in neural networks, focusing on how different dimensions within this space can represent various characteristics of the data being modeled. It discusses the implications of this structure for understanding model behavior, improving interpretability, and enhancing generative capabilities. The author utilizes visualizations and theoretical frameworks to illustrate how latent representations can be analyzed and manipulated, drawing connections to practical applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Overall, it emphasizes the significance of comprehensively understanding neural latent spaces to better harness their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current embeddings are badly trained and are massively holding back networks. A core issue is something I call 'token drag'. Low frequency tokens, when they finally come up, drag the model back towards an earlier state causing a lot of lost training. This leads to the first few layers of a model effectively being dedicated to just being a buffer to the bad embeddings feeding the model. Luckily fixing this is actually really easy. Creating a sacrificial two layer network to predict embeddings in training (and then just calculating the embeddings once for prod inference) gives a massive boost to training. To see this in action check out the unified embeddings in this project: https://github.com/jmward01/lmplay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, great set of reads. Thanks to @sean_pedersen for posting, looking forward to reviewing this in my closeout this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524352</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;NASA's Parker Solar Probe has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by successfully completing its closest approach to the Sun, coming within 7 million kilometers of the solar surface. This proximity allows the probe to collect valuable data about the Sun's outer atmosphere and solar wind, significantly enhancing our understanding of solar phenomena and their impact on the solar system. The mission aims to unravel the mysteries surrounding solar activity and its influence on space weather, which is crucial for protecting technology and life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of abstraction in programming and design, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the difference between useful abstractions and those that oversimplify complex systems. It critiques common practices in software development that may rely too heavily on abstraction, potentially leading to loss of clarity and understanding. The author advocates for a more mindful approach to abstraction that maintains the integrity of the underlying systems while still providing necessary simplifications for effective communication and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best way to achieve a good abstraction is to recall what the word meant before computer science: namely, something closer to generalization.In computing, we emphasize the communicational (i.e. interface) aspects of our code, and, in this respect, tend to focus on an "abstraction"'s role in hiding information. But a good abstraction does more than simply hide detail, it generalizes particulars into a new kind of "object" that is easier to reason about.If you keep this in mind, you'll realize that having a lot of particulars to identify shared properties that you can abstract away is a prerequisite. The best abstractions I've seen have always come into being only after a significant amount of particularized code had already been written. It is only then that you can identify the actual common properties and patterns of use. Contrarily, abstractions that are built upfront to try and do little more than hide details or to account for potential similarities or complexity, instead of actual already existent complexity are typically far more confusing and poorly designed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish articles like this had more examples in them. In between “this thin wrapper adds no value but a lot of complexity”, and “this thin wrapper clarified the interface and demonstrably saved loads of work last time requirements changed” is an awful lot of grey area and nuance.I did like the advice that if you peak under the abstraction a lot, it’s probably a bad one, tho even this I feel could use some nuance. I think if you need to change things in lots of places that’s a sign of a bad abstraction. If there is some tricky bit of complexity with changing requirements, you might find yourself “peeking under the hood” a lot. How could it be otherwise? But if you find yourself only debugging the one piece of code that handles the trickiness, and building up an isolated test for that bit of code, well, that sounds like you built a wonderful abstraction despite it being peaked at quite a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps this is a minor nitpick, but&gt; Abstractions are also the enemy of simplicity. Each new abstraction is supposed to make things simpler—that’s the promise, right?Not exactly, no. The purpose of abstraction is to hide implementation detail, and thereby insulate one part of the codebase/application/system from variations in another. Graphics APIs for example - yes your code may be simpler for not having to deal with the register-level minutiae of pushing individual triangles, but the core benefit is that the same code should work on multiple different hardware devices.Good abstractions break a codebase up into compartments - if you drop a grenade in one (change the requirements for example), then the others are unaffected and the remedial work required is much less.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42506984</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 20 years ago, I visited most of Europe’s major cities over the course of a two-month trip, traveling primarily by night train. Each overnight ride saved me the cost of a hostel or guesthouse, and I’d arrive in a new city each morning feeling refreshed because of the train’s sleeping accommodations.There used to be a similar service between Toronto and Montreal (both directions), where the train would pause for several hours midway so passengers would arrive at around 7:30 a.m. well-rested.I’ve taken that route as well, and it’s remarkable how much you see while traveling by train. You pass through countless towns, villages, and beautiful scenery—experiences you simply can’t get from flying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being visually impaired, I love the independence that the public transport network in Central Europe gives me. I live in the Netherlands, and frequently visit my parents in Belgium. I've also visited friends in Germany, all without relying on a sighted companion for transportation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand how it works. First time clicking on Poland, it showed a kind of a heat map around some city. Then I click on another location and nothing happens. OK, there's a "back" button, I go back, click on the map again in a different place and... nothing happens. No heat map. At some point in frustration I accidentally move the mouse while clicking and the map rotates upside down. Don't know, is it me, my browser, or there's something about the UI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530332</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ada is a criminally underrated tool that is unfortunately probably doomed to perpetually take the backseat to Rust despite Rust not solving all the problems Ada does. It's really sad that so many people's idea of safe programming is pretty strictly limited to memory safety, and that because Ada's baseline memory safety (SPARK is a different story) isn't as robust as Rust's borrow checker (in the sense that it doesn't have a borrow checker in favor of just avoiding dynamic allocations whenever possible), that it's a relic of the past.Ada's type system, SPARK, general clarity on behavior, etc. allows you to structure programs in a manner that makes it hard to Hold It Wrong, especially when dealing with embedded firmware that has all sorts of hardware gotchas. I haven't gotten the chance to use the Tasking primitives in anger yet, but I have a strong suspicion that they're going to bail my ass out of a lot of problems just like the rest of the language has.My team started at a new employer and made the jump from C to Ada for MCU firmware. We control things that spin real fast and our previous experiences with C definitely resulted in some screwups that left you weak in the knees for a bit. There was some initial hesitation but nobody has any interest in going back now. Rust was floated but we're all glad we didn't opt for it -- memory safety on a system that never allocates memory doesn't hold a candle to Ada's bitfield mapping/representation clauses, ranged types, decimal types, reference manual, formal verification options, concern from the powers that be about providing a stable and trustworthy environment for doing shit that you really don't want to get wrong, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coming from the type theory side with only a passing glance at Ada, I am nevertheless sure: this is not what type theorists mean when they talk about dependently typed languages. Such languages derive from the formulation of Per Martin-Löf (also called Intuitionistic Type Theory), they include dependent sum and dependent product types, and they allow type checkers to prove complex statements about code. (The history of dependent types is intertwined with the history of formalizing mathematics; dependent types were designed to encode essentially arbitrary mathematical statements.)The interesting feature of Ada here seems to be what it calls "subtype predicates". As you've explained, these come in a "dynamic" flavor, which are a nice syntax for runtime assertions, and a static flavor, which are compile-time checked but restricted to certain static expressions (per https://ada-lang.io/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.2#p15_3_3.2.4).An example of something you can do in a dependently typed language is write a sorting function in such a way that the type checker proves that the output will always be in sorted order. I am pretty sure this cannot be done in Ada; checking at runtime does not count!I do believe (having heard from multiple sources) that Ada's type system was ahead of its time and its success in creating practical programs that are likely to be correct is probably underrated. But I'm not here just to legislate semantics; one should be aware that there is something vastly more powerful out there called "dependent types" (even if that power is not likely to come into most people's day-to-day).(Unfortunately Wikipedia is quite poor on this topic; you will see, for example, that on the Talk page someone asked "Is Ada really dependently typed?" two years ago; no reply. And it makes no sense to say that Ada has "tactics" but not "proof terms"; tactics are a way of generating proof terms. There are many better resources out there (especially ones associated with the languages Agda, Coq (currently being renamed Rocq), and Lean, e.g. https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/dependent_typ...). But be warned, there is no "short version": dependent types cannot be explained in a sentence, and they are not something you will arrive at with enough "hacking away".)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One other neat thing about discriminated records is that you're not limited to just a single field with a variable size, you can also write something like this:    type My_Record (A, B : My_Integer) is record
       X : My_Array (1 .. A);
       Y : My_Array (1 .. B);
    end record;

A record that's created from this will have those arrays tightly packed rather than leaving space at the end of the first one like you might expect (this might be compiler dependant, but it's definitely how GCC does it). Also note that these values can be set at runtime, so this isn't just a generic in disguise (although in Ada you can also instantiate generics at runtime).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42528302</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Numbers Are Leaves" discusses the idea that numbers can be visualized as leaves on a tree, representing growth and connection in a mathematical context. It explores how numbers, like leaves, can branch out and create complex structures, emphasizing their role in understanding relationships and patterns in nature and mathematics. The author illustrates this concept through various examples and analogies, highlighting the beauty and interconnectedness of numerical systems. Overall, the piece invites readers to rethink their perception of numbers and appreciate their deeper implications in both math and the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I think a fair thing to ask is if the force-directed layout engine is uniquely responsible for the leaf-like structure and this has nothing to do with the Von Neumann ordinals themselves.&gt; To check this I generated some Collatz trees and they ended up looking like microbes. I think it's safe to say the answer is no."Uniquely responsible" seems to be doing too much work. These structures are reminiscent of dendritic fractals coming about from diffusion-limited aggregation in electrochemical deposition[1], which is a transitional phenomenon with a phase diagram (molar concentration of the electrolyte vs voltage) There is a sweet spot in the middle where you get intricate dendritic crystals: outside of that you get smooth layers or big blobs / spikes without much internal structure.I suspect it is primarily the modeling of the forces which is responsible for the behavior, with the topological structure of the tree somewhat indirectly corresponding to the chemical and electrical parameters. I am by no means an expert but it seems likely to me that these von Neumann dendrites vs the structure of Collatz trees is a fairly shallow relationship: lots of trees with similar graph-theoretic properties to the von Neumann trees would also demonstrate the leaf-like fractals, but with no meaningful relationship to the natural numbers. But it would be interesting to make this more precise.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more compact and beautiful relation exists between integers and finite rooted trees exist, imo.David W. Matula found a correspondence between trees and integers using prime factorization, and reported it in 1968 in SIAM:
"A Natural Rooted Tree Enumeration by Prime Factorization", SIAM Rev. 10, 1968, p.273 [1]Others have commented on it before, search the web for Matula NumbersI independently found this relation when working on a bar code system that was topologically robust to deformation. I wrote a document that explained this relation here[2].I created an interactive javascript notebook that draws related topological diagrams for numbers. [3][1] http://williamsharkey.com/matulaSIAM.png[2] https://williamsharkey.com/integer-tree-isomorphism.pdf[3] https://williamsharkey.com/MatulaExplorer/MatulaExplorer.htm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I would like to understand why numbers looks like leaves1st of all they don't. The graph doesn't look like pinnatids or palmatids. There is some resemblance of an alternating disposition of leaves, but that's not the shape of the leaf itself but the distribution of them, and it's a stretch.Secondly, I'll take the generous interpretation of the question which is, why the graph looks mathematically like leaves, and not a question of biological impact, whatever resemblance is a coincidence which brings us toThird, OP is playing a game with numbers with no objective  goal (yes all maths is this, but this is straight up chmess), there is no ultimate meaning to be derived of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42515315</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; EmacsConf feels like a nice, cozy get-together where people share the cool things they've been working on and thinking about.Emacsconf was indeed executed great this year, and nice and cozy were my feelings too. It's interesting to compare and contrast the ambience between Emacsconf and that of the other editors' like neovim conf and the release "parties" of Visual Studio Code and Jetbrains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The total hosting cost for the conference was USD 42.92 + tax and the BBB testing in the lead-up to the conference was USD 3.11 + tax, so a total of USD 46.03+tax. The web node and the livestreaming node are kept as 1GB nanodes the rest of the year (USD 5 x 2 servers + tax, so USD 110). Very manageable.How does this compared to all other conf costs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was supposed to be one talk about an attempt to re-vitalize a Guile-powered Emacs. I am not sure if it's in there somewhere or not (but I haven't looked yet).I imagine Emacs gaining native compilation capability took some pressure off that. But the appeal of scripting Emacs in languages other than Elisp still has some appeal, I think. Scheme or Lua would very nice for that purpose.EDIT: There it is - https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/guile/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531217</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to add the term "ADVANCED" in terms of foundry node now has an official meaning anything sub 7nm. With specific rules in place in terms of export especially to China. This was a reference from ASML presentation not so long ago.It is also important to point out, the achievement here is how fast TSMC manage to set things up and running even without the home ground advantage. Intel couldn't even replicate this time frame if it was their Intel 7nm Fab. And of course the greatest record was that with enough planning and permission done before hand TSMC manage to have the fab built and running within 18 months in Taiwan. ( Arguably closer to 12 months )This also means unless a miracle happen or US Gov being unfair with certain things the chances of Intel catching up with its current team, management, board members and investors, against TSMC in terms of capacity, price, and lead time as a foundry is close to zero. ( I am sorry but I lost all faith and hope now Pat Gelsinger is out. )Once TSMC 2nm hits the ground later this year, TSMC US will also start their 3nm work if they haven't started now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What really baffles me is how Taiwans leadership can’t see the US endgame with the CHIPs act and the Chinese sanctions. The US government wants to steal TSMC by using subterfuge, sheer force and malice, while making Taiwan paying for it by refusing the revenue of selling advanced chips to China. 
Not even TSMC should feel safe even if they successfully relocate themselves to the US. 
Buccaneering has a long tradition in Anglo-Saxon countries and as TikTok shows the US has no qualms in preaching free commerce, stable legal rules and all that bullshit to everyone else, while doing the most egregious mercantilist stuff without even an once of shame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great news and arguably these are the most advanced semiconductors being produced in the United States today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42525384</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm seeing a lot of back in forth in the comments between hiring managers and employees discussing who is more responsible for the current situation, but from the perspective of someone looking for a job what should I be doing?I've been pretty aggressively looking for a job for the past six months or so. I have 10+ years of professional software dev experience so I've mostly been looking at senior dev positions. I haven't used LLMs at all in my resume, cover letters, etc. I only apply to jobs that I believe I meet the requirements for and that I would likely accept if given an offer. How do I signal that 1) I am a real person 2) I really do have the job experience and skills listed on my resume, and 3) I really am interested in the specific job I'm applying for. Because doing this my hit rate has been abysmal. I've had maybe 10-12 initial phone screens (never an issue, I easily make it past these). Past that I've had maybe 3-4 interviews that get into the later rounds. From that I've had zero offers.So why should I keep doing what I'm doing when it's getting me nowhere? Why shouldn't I switch to an automated "shotgun" approach that applies me to as many jobs as possible to which I vaguely fit the requirements? The only other way I've seen suggested to signal that I'm a real person with real experience is to know someone in the company who can vouch for me (which I almost never do).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a software manager that has been doing some form of interviewing/hiring for 13 years.I did two rounds of hiring software engineers last year, one in spring that seemed normal, and one in the fall that was was brutal. The fall hiring had a flood of applicants, and in retrospect, most seemed like AI was used in some way.For the fall round, I suddenly had a higher percentage of applicants that qualified after resume screening and initial phone screen, but they all collapsed when I did a technical round. And failure rate on the technical was much much worse than usual.We have a full-time recruiter working with us, and I'm not 100% sure what tools he used, but I switched to manually reviewing each resume, and given that it was 100s, it took a long time, but I still had my problem of great initial screen, terrible technical interview.Then, I decided to throw out anyone who heavily mentioned AI, LLM, or data science. After all, with almost a thousand applicants, I needed to sort some how. (To be fair, our use case is more esoteric, we're not writing Javascript or parsers, so it's not as much of a time-saver.) Large chunks of applicants dropped and the process felt more normal.I also switched to only on-site interviews. My initial technical screenings are still done remotely. Before COVID we were 100% on-site interviews, but did hybrid after COVID. Now, I'm back to enforcing on-site for my group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice. But as a hiring manager, this is the last thing we want. Flooded with auto submitted Resumes. I posted a job recently and got 100+ resumes in 2 days and 99% were not even remotely close to being a good fit. I struggled to sort through so many Resumes to find someone worth interviewing.The problem is that with so much noise, good candidates may get ignored or rejected by mistake. And the cycle continues.I get that the market is bad right now and there are lot of people looking for jobs but auto submissions and flooding job sites wont work. Not for the ones that matter anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531695</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The forum thread discusses issues encountered with a 4TB Crucial T500 NVMe SSD related to PCIe compatibility and performance. Users share their experiences and troubleshooting steps, including recognizing the SSD in BIOS but facing problems with Windows detection and speed. Various suggestions are offered, such as checking motherboard firmware, trying different PCIe slots, and ensuring proper power connections. The thread highlights the complexities of hardware compatibility and user experiences in diagnosing and resolving SSD-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading the thread it looks like the issue is leakage power on the internal 3.3v line. When the system is off 1.9v is still present. This is not uncommon, although 1.9v is a bit high. A lot of laptops have explicit active pull downs on power supplies to clamp them to zero when power is off to ensure peripherals are not accidentally powered on by stray leakage (because laptops are extremely low power by design and there is not enough stray leakage to bring the power lines down in a sleep state). My guess is main boards might not have this feature because normally there is enough off state loading that it takes care of itself. however maybe in this case the loading is not enough.A dirty fix could be to just put a static load on the 3.3v line to ground. I'd start with a 1/4w resistor around 100 ohms and just stick it from 3.3v to ground to see if that does not soak up the stray current. if it works just leave it, it's about 0.1 watts of static power and no big deal for a non portable setup.The larger picture is that the controller on the nvme might not hit its power on reset condition because it may be rated to run at 1.8v (just a guess), so 3.3v is not going low enough for the controller to perceive the system has been power cycled. Usually a supplemental power monitor is needed in those cases to ensure a reset is generated in case of leakage problems like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HDMI provides power - that's how old chromecasts can work without a separate power plug.The comment about NPNs and PNPs is garbage, but there is a design fault with the board - it shouldn't allow HDMI power to flow backwards into the motherboard when the motherboard shuts off. That would likely cause a power rail sequencing issue on the board or SSD, leading to latch-up of various ICs, and non-detection on the SSD on the flowing bootup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of odd failure modes involving Crucial SSDs and MSI motherboards (though one that seems to actually be the drives fault) I have a t705 which at some point started only coming up as x2 lanes instead of x4 no matter which board I put it into (with no visible damage or indication as to why, though I did try to wipe down the contact side with some rubbing alcohol anyways).The particularly interesting part is I have a new x870 motherboard which supports m.2 slot 2 as being 0x, 2x, or 4x CPU direct lanes depending if you want 4x, 2x, or 0x to go to the USB 4 ports respectively. At first it sounds like a good combo - put the drive which wants to run at x2 only in the extra slot where x2 only mode is a reasonable tradeoff and still get great bandwidth because those lanes are pcie 5 and not through the chipset. For whatever reason though that drive only ever comes up in an x4 slot (at x2 speed) but not any x2 slots I've tried. I don't know enough about PCIe to assume why that is for sure but it seemed odd to me it was any way but "something is wrong with the 3rd or 4th lane and setting the slot to x2 lets the first 2 work at x2 the same as when the slot is set to x4 and it only comes up as x2".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42528216</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd call this paper a "big deal" in that it is a normalization of, very fair summary of, and indication that there is a future for, LLMs in pure mathematics from one of its leading practitioners.On HN here, we've spent the last few years talking and thinking a lot about LLMs, so the paper might not include much that would be surprising to math-curious HN'ers. However, there is a large cohort of research mathematicians out there that likely doesn't know much about modern AI; Terence is saying there's a little utility in last-gen models (GPT-4), and he expects a lot of utility out of combining next-gen models with Lean.Again, not surprising if you read his blog, but I think publishing a full paper in AMS is a pretty important moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are also several videos of Tao giving 1hr talks on this topic, for example https://youtu.be/e049IoFBnLA?t=89&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actually, most of the paper seems a bit obvious from the computer science side. LLMs scale for really complex tasks, but they are neither correct nor complete. If combined with a tool that is correct (code verifiers, interactive theore provers), then we can get back a correct pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42529023</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;A tanker linked to Russia was seized by Finland while reportedly carrying espionage equipment. The vessel was allegedly involved in cutting undersea cables, raising security concerns. The operation's implications highlight the tensions surrounding maritime activities related to national security and intelligence, particularly in the context of Russian military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In terms of international law and international maritime law, this is a fascinating case. Without directly applicable precedent, an actor does what it can/must within existing law.Finland has always been very conservative in such matters, and you can be sure that they thought long and hard about what their public legal position will be before they boarded the ship.The Russians will be conservative here too, because obviously the existing body of law has worked in their favor, giving them space to operate a "black fleet" - and to use it to execute sabotage. Or so they thought...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The hi-tech equipment on board was abnormal for a merchant ship and consumed more power from the ship’s generator, leading to repeated blackouts, a source familiar with the vessel who provided commercial maritime services to it as recently as seven months ago.Am I having a stroke or is this article translated?I'm not a Russia defender but this is comically inept if true.  Why commit such brazen sabotage with a spy ship?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the point of doing something like this?Its not very sneaky, they got caught rather easily.The damage is annoying, but deep sea cables have problems from time to time, its not like it created critical downtime or is unrepairable damage.Is this just russia trying to give some sort of warning? A sort of, you have lots of exposed infrastructure, if you keep calling my bluff i might start going after it for real-zies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524174</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Magnus Carlsen was disqualified from the World Rapid and Blitz Championship for wearing jeans, which violated the tournament's dress code. The reigning chess world champion faced controversy as he appeared in casual attire rather than the mandatory formal clothing. This incident underscored the importance of adhering to tournament regulations, raising discussions about dress codes in professional sports. Carlsen's disqualification marked a significant moment in the tournament, highlighting the intersection of professionalism and personal expression in competitive settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The context in which this happened matters a lot.There have been tensions between the FIDE organization and top players like Carlsen since the latter have been promoting an alternative chess organization around Freestyle chess (aka Chesss960), which has slightly different rules.I.e. this is less about "dress code enforcement" and it is more about "Carlsen is fed up with the FIDE organization in general".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FIDE dress code [1] appears to only forbid torn jeans, but otherwise explicitly allows them:&gt; The following is acceptable for men players, captains, head of delegation.
Suits, ties, dressy pants, trousers, *jeans*.And then later:&gt; The following is NOT acceptable for men players, captains, head of delegation.
Beach-wear slips, profanity and nude or semi-nude
pictures printed on shirts, torn pants or jeans.Magnus did not wear torn jeans [2], I can’t see any justification for this enforcement choice.Don’t even get me started on the sex differences in these rules.[1]: https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2013/FIDE/Proposal_...
[2]: https://x.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1872819038554148882&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if there is even a single player in the tournament who cares about the dress code. It is hard to imagine anyone who was serious about chess caring about the material a player’s pants are made of. No, I think this falls squarely in the realm of bureaucratic administrators who have nothing better to do than assert their power and maintain the illusion of a connection between talent (great chess players) and the trivial signaling games of the upper class (the style of pants one is wearing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42527572</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how OpenAI, the company behind models like ChatGPT, has utilized strategies similar to Google's to optimize its search results and improve user engagement. It highlights the integration of AI in search functionalities, advancing how information is retrieved and presented. The author critiques the implications of such techniques on content visibility and competition, emphasizing the evolving landscape of digital search and the potential monopolistic tendencies inherent in AI-driven models.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just sharing an anecdote:I was searching for a quote that I'd heard in an audiobook the other day. I just had the general paraphrase, and didn't feel like scanning through the chapters to go find it. This was a somewhat obscure source.Google had just straight garbage for me. The quote was political in nature, and I felt like the results were fighting general tone-policing filters and were tuned for recent events.o1 on the other hand, found the author of the quote, summarized the general idea of what i might be searching for and then cited potential sources.It's just patently obvious to me that google has failed in delivering the core value prop of their product, they're begging to be replaced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't bet on AI staying clean.A lot of HN readers conceptualize the forces attacking the integrity of the search results as just some isolated people taking occasional potshots, and then maybe slinking away if their trick gets blocked.It is probably a lot more accurate to visualize the SEO industry as a Dark Google. Roughly as well resourced, with many smart people working on it full time, day in, day out, with information sharing and coordination. It isn't literally one company, but this conception is probably a lot closer then the one in the heads of most people reading this. Dark Google is motivated, resourced, and smart.And then, once I started thinking of it that way for this post, I realized that increasingly.... Google is increasingly at beck and call of Dark Google. They're increasingly the real customers of Google and the real source of money. It's why Google just seems to be getting worse and worse for us... it's because we're not the real customers any more. Dark Google rules.And if Dark Google has not yet figured out how to scam AI... it is only a matter of time. Dark Google is where Google gets its money now. When Dark Google turns its attention to AI fully, OpenAI will be no more able to resist its economic incentives than Google did.Can't wait for the first screenshot of someone searching for the impact of the battle of Gettysburg on the civil war and seeing the AI do its subtle best to slide an add for Coca Cola into it in some semantically bizarre manner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SEO ruined the web, guided by Google's ranking algorithm.Things will get even worse as scammy companies start flooding the web with LLM generated content pushing their products to bias LLMs to increase the probability of outputing their name for keywords related to their business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42532441</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel deep learning framework for image segmentation tasks, integrating a multi-scale feature extractor and a refined attention mechanism. It aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of segmenting images by addressing limitations in existing methods. Through extensive experiments, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, highlighting its capabilities in dealing with varying object scales and complex backgrounds. The research emphasizes the importance of both spatial and contextual information in segmentation tasks and showcases the potential for real-world applications in computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper has one author, was not written in latex, and no comment referencing a peer reviewed venue. Do other people in this field look at these same signals and pre-judge the paper negatively?I did attempt to check my bias and skim the paper, it does seem well written and takes a decent shot towards understanding LLMs. However, I am not a fan of black-box explanations, so I didn't read much (I really like Sparse autoencoders). Has anyone else read the paper? How is the quality?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;explainable AI just ain't there yet.I wonder if the author took a class with Lipton, since he's at CMU.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's personal journey and experiences with Forth stack machines, detailing their history, development, and the author's interactions with this unique programming language and its hardware. The author reflects on the challenges and learning moments encountered while working with Forth, exploring its advantages and idiosyncrasies compared to more conventional programming languages. Additionally, the piece highlights the significance of Forth in the realm of stack-based computing and the author's passion for its continued relevance in modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42532157"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll agree with a lot of his critiques, but one of his small ones that surprisingly echoed a lot of frustration was the dictum to prefer small definitions.&gt; Quoting Chuck Moore:&gt; Forth is highly factored code. I don't know anything else to say except that Forth is definitions. If you have a lot of small definitions you are writing Forth. In order to write a lot of small definitions you have to have a stack.It seemed like apologetics and a making a virtue out of necessity, given the fact that I don't have the capability to do stack acrobatics in my head live. The only way to be able to read a function in my head, without taking a pencil to paper _was_ small functions. But I found that clashed with the ways some algorithms and procedures naturally expressed themselves in longer multi-step style, and actually ending up being more verbose and tangled with multiple top-level definitions.It turns out that local variables that compile to C-style indirect (SP + i) accesses are only mildly more expensive than stack acrobatics, but still gave the flexibility of Forth-style metaprogramming. [1]Ultimately, the author's points about the "Forth philosophy" but not Forth-the-language itself (and extremely spare code) ring true to me.Given my limitations, life is too short to work to have as minimalist an implementation as you'd like, and to desire to have a interactive development environment in &lt;128k. For me, it's hard enough to implement the "subject" that I'm programming algorithmically/data-driven-ly/amortizing-computation-ly efficiently.[1] https://www.novabbs.com/devel/article-flat.php?id=26347&amp;grou...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate Yossi's plain honesty in this article, and it's a fun and interesting read; I've read it before.I can relate to, but not endorse, designing a CPU and dialect for an interesting language you've never properly used.  This turned out to be very painful, and Yossi argues convincingly that it is essentially not practical to use Forth at all, debating Jeff Fox's position.  However, there is some evidence[1] that Forth actually might be practical, and it certainly seemed to have a niche in the 80's.Yossi made some errors I've seen among new Forth programmers.  A lot of people, before writing real programs, think Forth is like lisp from another universe.  They visualise Forth primarily as a sort-of functional, concatenative, highly refactor-focused language.  They likewise tend to throw out all the normal Forth defining words and use Forth as 'lisp without parentheses'.  They try and put all their data on the stack, 'point-free', rather than using variables.  And often their projects eventually devolve into C envy, every line with stack comments and equivalent C code to help, as shown in the article.But go look at real, working, classic Forth code, of which there is much, and you'll see that there is a prevailing style that's easy to read and not actually that 'smart', or 'academic'.  No more than 1-2 stack items need to be mentally 'juggled' for 99% of code, lots of variables and buffers are used whenever it's easier.  Yes the classic variables are 'global', but it doesn't matter if the relevant code isn't recursing or touched in interrupts, and is only used by a cluster of related words.  Newer Forths do have local variables, in spite of Jeff Fox's disapproval!The classic code I'm talking about matches what I think Jeff Fox is trying to coerce you towards.  Ultimately I disagree with Yossi's views because I think if he had actually tried to implement what Jeff Fox proposes, and got some practice first on a more realistic project, he would have had a much better shot.  It's impressive how well the project turned out in spite of the approach, and how Yossi wrote a backend for his architecture in a week: a testament to both his skills and LLVM's design; but it's worth reflecting as engineers how arrogant (yet relatable) it is to make a CPU and compiler for a language you've never properly used.[1] https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(22)00025-6/ful...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stack machines are a place where hardware goes to die.  We have this book at my Uni libraryhttps://www.amazon.com/Stack-Computers-Wave-Philip-Koopman/d...but in 1989 these were not a new wave at all,  but another CPU without a future like the Lisp machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42532157</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the programming language Rust and its growing importance in building safe and reliable software. It emphasizes Rust's unique features, such as its ownership model and memory safety guarantees, which help prevent common programming errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities. The piece highlights real-world applications and projects that have successfully utilized Rust to enhance safety and performance. Additionally, it advocates for Rust's adoption in more critical sectors and encourages developers to embrace its robust capabilities for safer programming practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm writing firmware for my espresso machine in Rust right now and I was also pretty blown away at how easy it is. I am writing code across two micro-controllers (I'm re-using existing hardware) and I am using no-std RTIC2+Embassy on an STM32 inside machine and std Embassy on a ESP32-S3 on the outside of the machine. I don't know C++ (although C++ for embedded would probably have been fine, except I don't like C++ anyway) and it would have been a lot more work to get this working in C.Using Rust I get so many static guarantees that it makes it trivial to get things working. And things have matured a lot since the last time I checked about a year ago.Things are still a bit rough, for example I am maintaining my own version of embassy-stm32 so I can make a few things work the way I want to, but it's not really a problem for an embedded project.Developing rust for xtensa is also a bit painful at times, but it still beats writing C or C++.Moreover, RTIC2 allows me to write high performance real time code the way I would have written it in C with a mountain of boilerplate removed from sight just down to the way async works in rust as well as the things RTIC handles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried using async rust on my esp32 last year, and though i got some functionality working, any little victory was always followed seconds later by big, productivity halting, hard-to-overcome hurdles. Im glad people smarter than me are making it happen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No mention of Ferrocene other than a "further reading" bullet point at the end. Are they using it? Does that help with respect to getting a device safety certified?From https://ferrocene.dev:&gt; ISO26262 (ASIL D), IEC 61508 (SIL 4) and IEC 62304 available targetting Linux, QNX Neutrino or your choice of RTOS.The article also mentions one of those standards:&gt; Sonair is developing a safety-certified device (IEC 61508 and SIL2).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42513331</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide for developers who want to write Java code using Neovim, an extensible text editor. It outlines the necessary tools and configurations for setting up a productive Java development environment in Neovim, including the installation of language servers, plugins, and relevant settings. The author emphasizes the customization possibilities of Neovim, offering tips on integrating features like autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and error checking to enhance the coding experience. The post aims to empower Java developers to utilize Neovim effectively for their programming needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I’ll preface this by saying that if Neovim isn’t your primary editor, you should first try an IDE specifically for Java."Seconded.As someone who has spent a lot of time configuring editors, but doesn't enjoy it quite as much as he used to, I gave Java on Neovim a shot this summer.There are two main routes to go - both of which are described in the article. Either install it yourself, "You read the friendly manual", or use someone else's installer, "You use a distro".My problem with someone else's installer is that I don't understand what it's doing, which in turn gives me the feeling that it's pulling in the kitchen sink, which is exactly the feeling I hoped to avoid by not using my regular IDE.My problem with installing it myself is that I have to learn the entire ecosystem including, but not limited to, learning how to use Neovim for more than editing a simple text file, learning the Lua scripting language, learning where Neovim keeps its' configuration files and what to put in them, curating a set of plugins for highlighting, launching code, debugging, etc., figuring out how to configure those plugins for Neovim and finally how to make those plugins play nice together.In the end it just wasn't for me but if Neovim is your primary editor it might be for you.&gt; Java has one LSP option for Neovim, and that’s JDTLS (Java Development Tools Language Server) by Eclipse.Just wanted to mention that there is another LSP for Java, https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/java/java.lsp..., but I don't know if anyone has gotten it to work with Neovim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I always hear "you don't need a full blown IDE, vscode/neovim/other text editor should be enough". Then I read those articles about which plugins/bundles/addons I need to install and I wonder at which point do we call it IDE instead of text editor (with plugins).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very nice. One thing that always prevents me from using anything other than a full-blown IDE for Java is the fact that most entreprise projects use Maven and structure packages with the default Java way by using the FQDN structure (e.g.: org/example/groupid/packageid/submodule/File.java).Maybe I'm missing something but navigating and finding/adding files in a structure that's 10-20 directories deep or more seems like a nightmare in pure Vim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530991</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decline of physical paper passports as countries increasingly adopt digital alternatives for international travel. It highlights the benefits of digital passports, such as enhanced security and efficiency in border control, while also addressing the challenges and concerns related to privacy and data protection. The piece emphasizes that, despite the shift towards digitalization, many travelers still prefer the tangible aspect of paper passports, raising questions about the future of travel documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are significant downsides to the digitalization of travel documents. The biggest one I can think of is ownership - the UK is moving to an entirely digital visa system and bringing in an ESTA style system called ETA for visa free countries. Unfortunately this means that residency cards for noncitizens are being phased out. This means that when the Home Office messes up and accidentally deletes your immigration status, or you are at an airport with no internet access, you have no evidence whatsoever of what status you hold. It also means you will no longer be in possession of any records that might be useful years in the future when the current database containing immigration records will likely have been replaced. It’s much easier to keep a piece of paper around for 30+ years than it is to make sure a digital record doesn’t rot in that time.I feel strongly that any future digital travel credentials that are offered by governments should be able to operate entirely offline, and provide records that can be retained by the data subject. That means that revocation is harder, but IMO that’s a tradeoff that is worth making to avoid another Windrush scandal.This has already become a pain when dealing with countries that don’t stamp passports, because when you need to apply for something that asks for your travel history over the past 10 years, you might not have any records anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As soon as the local banks here started the push of 'you'll be locked out of your account if you dont activate our App' I switched to a dumb-phone.  Tech has turned against us, and as a developer I feel very sad about that.I strongly believe that a smart-phone should not be a requirement to partake in society.Something as basic and important as a passport should not be entrusted to these ad-phones.  Same with the push for smart-phone fintech / digital currency, or card-only retail.  The 'easy option' seems to cost us more and more freedoms.'This app requires permission to access your passport details.  This is only to confirm your date of birth, and thus your eligibility to access the ad infested internet'Having ranted about all that, I have to say that requesting a new UK passport last month was The best website experience I have had in a very long time.  Simple UI, clear process, and worked perfectly without needing the latest nightly build of whatever new browser API / GB framework is the monthly fad.  Just a shame it is quite ugly compared to the previous European one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of replacing passports with apps, in between would support passport cards. Better to allow using national ID cards as passports. The digital data could be saved on card but with physical photo and info as backup. It also works for people without smartphone.The US has passport cards but they only work for land and sea from Canada, Mexico, and Caribbean countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521629</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nowadays, whenever I browse Netflix, I feel like that Bruce Springsteen song, "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)."[a] Sure, there are lots of choices, but they all kinda suck. I find myself wondering, why? The OP weaves an insightful, opinionated narrative that explains how we got here. Much of it rings true. This passage, in particular struck a chord with me:&gt; Several screenwriters who’ve worked for the streamer told me a common note from company executives is “have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along.” [...] One tag among Netflix’s thirty-six thousand microgenres offers a suitable name for this kind of dreck: “casual viewing.” Usually reserved for breezy network sitcoms, reality television, and nature documentaries, the category describes much of Netflix’s film catalog — movies that go down best when you’re not paying attention, or as the Hollywood Reporter recently described Atlas, a 2024 sci-fi film starring Jennifer Lopez, “another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry.”In other words, people like me, who want to focus on and  experience a great film or series, are no longer the target audience.Apparently, there's no money in targeting people who want to pay attention.---[a] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/57_Channels_(And_Nothin'_On)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this also applies: https://medium.com/luminasticity/netflix-the-crap-you-put-up...&gt;A signature characteristic of Netflix’s strategy over the years has been to define genres into microscopic sub-genres and develop content on very specific customer likes — for example “Urban teen geniuses who invent time travel”&gt;There is an unfortunate issue with making things bad and to somebody’s taste — the person whose taste you are courting may be happy to be courted but if all they ever get of things to their taste are things that are bad representations of that taste they may come to sour on what they once loved.and that is I think what happens a lot with Netflix, they produce approximations of the thing you love, and by doing this bad half-assed version with the wires sticking out and everything, in the end you don't love that thing anymore.Netflix in the hunt for quick engagement eats the seed corn of fandom, and are left with nothing to build on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Netflix thought they could take on Hollywood and beat them at their own film game. But in the process they realized that it’s not actually a game worth winning, and more importantly, that YouTube and TikTok are their real competition, not Hollywood.The future of most media is video-based, and I think Netflix probably understands this and is trying to get away from the historical model as movies you watch online and closer to the optimized video ecosystem of YouTube. The latter is more relevant in a world with video-playing devices everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42529756</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a summary of the Polyglot HTML ZIP PNG format, which allows users to create a single ZIP file that contains an HTML file along with PNG images. It explains how to structure the files and highlights the benefits of combining multiple resources into one file for easier distribution and use. The document also details examples and potential applications, showcasing the versatility of this format for developers and web designers. Overall, it serves as a guide for understanding and implementing the Polyglot format effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; a bug in “Archive Utility” on macOS prevents it from decompressing the resulting fileI looked into this in the past, it's because they check for a "PK" header at the start of the file - which is of course not actually required. I assumed it was deliberate because it does exclude most "weird" ZIPs.By the way, if you're interested in this sort of file format wrangling, check out Ange Albertini's talk tomorrow at 38c3: https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2024/fahrplan/talk/Q...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that you can also take advantage of the fact that a ZIP can be password-protected and make your web page secret! For example https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/private/ (password: "thisisapage").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would probably prefer to use text other than "Please wait..." since it won't work if JavaScripts are disabled. This can be fixed by changing the text to something such as "This is a HTML/ZIP/PNG polyglot file". And then, omit the &lt;title&gt; to save space.The URL jar:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HT... can be used to display the HTML file in some web browsers, although it cannot display the PNG file in this way since it uses # as the URL of the picture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526926</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a step in the right direction but still doesn't address my biggest concern with e-waste - the battery.Because almost none of the electronics you buy come with a replaceable battery, the second you buy something and use it on a regular basis it's destined to die and be thrown out within the next 4-8ish years due to the battery degrading and becoming increasingly more dangerous to keep around. Something that might be in perfect working condition and could be used for another 10 years has to be thrown out because of one single component.I understand that batteries come in all shapes, sizes, capacities, yada yada, but imagine if we had standard rechargeable batteries like we have standard non-rechargeable batteries and things were built in a way where you could easily replace batteries like we could on phones a decade ago. You would double or triple the lifespan of a ton of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently bought an ipad mini 6th gen and I notice that although it seems to have a USB-C charge port, if you use a regular old USB-C to USB-A cable and wall-wart it only charges to 75%. You have to use the apple-supplied USB-C (at both ends) cable to charge to 100%. Not sure what is going on there exactly but it seems like malicious compliance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534851</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the revelations made by Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI employee who has come forward as a whistleblower. Balaji claims that OpenAI has prioritized profit over ethical considerations and has raised concerns about the potential dangers of their AI systems. He argues that the organization's rapid development of artificial intelligence poses significant risks to society, and calls for more transparency and accountability in AI practices. The piece highlights Balaji's experiences and the implications of his allegations for the future of AI regulation and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

If the person talks about it, most people will believe they are crazy before believing they are being poisoned. There is no way to prove you have been poisoned without spending millions of dollars. All of the advances in medical science pave the way for these poisons to be developed and manufactured cheaply.OpenAI has direct connections to the military industrial complex in the US. The leaders in these orgs have huge egos that don't like to be double-crossed, and despite it not making sense long term for their business, they are perfectly safe to retaliate using these methods and choose to do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says it took them 40 seconds to determine suicide. I'm not sure how that determination could be made without knowledge of the firearm's ownership. Did he legally own the firearm? If not, how did he acquire the firearm?Is anyone else noticing the number of whistleblower deaths occurring? Boeing has had several in the past year.https://fortune.com/2024/05/02/boeing-whistleblower-dead-jos...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I doubt OpenAI is responsible for wrongdoing. OpenAI's strategic importance to AI development warrants an FBI investigation as a standard procedure.The whistleblower may have been approached by foreign governments seeking classified information, but declined to share it. There are many potential scenarios to consider, beyond the obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535057</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The page provides information about Unicon, a programming language that combines elements of Icon and other languages to facilitate diverse applications, particularly in system and data manipulation. It emphasizes Unicon's rich set of features, including generator expressions and user-defined data types, and supports concurrency and socket programming.

It uses Icon as an (optional) dependency to create cross-references during the weaving process. The fallback is based on Awk, but inferior in features. Anyway, if you have read this far, you should check out noweb and of course (Un)Icon.[1] https://github.com/nrnrnr/noweb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh silly me who read unicorn language for a long time before getting it…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Icon (and therefore Unicon) is one of my favorite languages.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a detailed photograph of a Pentium die that showcases the intricate design and features of the microprocessor. It highlights various aspects of the die, including the layout of millions of transistors and the advanced technology used in its production. Additionally, the piece provides insights into the historical significance of the Pentium processor in the evolution of computing and its impact on performance and capability in personal computers.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here if anyone has Pentium questions :-)My Mastodon thread about the bug was on HN a few weeks ago, so this might seem familiar, but now I've finished a detailed blog post. The previous HN post has a bunch of comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42391079&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bug is super fun, but I also find the Intel response to be fascinating on its own. They apparently didn’t replace everyone’s processor with a non faulty version who wanted it, resulting in a ton of bad press.To contrast, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Amazon Colorsoft launch, which had a yellow band graphics issue on some devices (mine included). Amazon waited a bit before acknowledging it (maybe a day or two, presumably to get the facts right). Then they simply quietly replace all of them. No recall. They just send you a new one if you ask for it (mine replacement comes Friday, hopefully it will fix it). My takeaway is that it’s pretty clear that having an incredibly robust return/support apparatus has a lot of benefits when launches don’t go quite right. Certainly more than you’d expect from analysis.Similarly I haven’t seen too many recent reports about the Apple AirPod Pros crackle issue that happened a couple years ago (my AirPods had to be replaced twice), but Apple also just quietly replaced them and the  support competence really seemed something powerful that isn’t always noticed.Colorsoft:  https://www.tomsguide.com/tablets/e-readers/amazon-kindle-co...AirPods Pro: https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did idiv work on the pentium.

&lt;p&gt;The article profiles a gambler named Bill Benter, who developed a sophisticated algorithm to analyze horse racing data and improve bet placement. Through extensive statistical analysis and the use of a mathematical model, Benter successfully identified patterns and factors that influence race outcomes, revolutionizing how betting strategies are approached. His success not only made him a multimillionaire but also highlighted the intersection between technology and gambling, demonstrating the potential for data-driven decision-making in the betting industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;British magician Darren Brown aired a TV special called "The System" revealing a foolproof method which allowed him to provide the name of the winning horse to a lucky person who randomly responded to his newspaper advertisement in time for that person to bet on the race and win. He continued doing this with that person for six more races over six consecutive weeks - with that person betting their own money and winning each time, beating astronomical odds and winning quite a large sum. The bets were real, legally placed in advance on televised races at regulated betting parlors and the person really randomly responded to the ad without knowing Brown beforehand. For the last race Brown and the person met at the race track but for all the prior races Brown didn't even know when or where the person would place their bet. He really had no involvement or even contact, other than sending the name of the horse to bet on via email once a week.Of course, it's (sort of) a very clever trick. All is revealed in the show (now on Brown's YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR970Y10WNw). I showed it to my kid who had recently asked me about a state lottery billboard claiming "Someone has to win!" and it proved to be an entertainingly effective answer as well as providing some good ways to think critically about gambling propositions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are two papers referenced in the article.

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Ek, the billionaire CEO of Spotify, has decided to shut down the Spotify Unwrapped Calculator, a tool that allowed users to see their listening habits and statistics from the year. This decision is part of Spotify's broader strategy to streamline features and focus on key offerings, as the company continues to innovate and adapt in the competitive streaming industry.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. I actually built an app called "Johnny Mnemonic" around 5 years ago that generated a mnemonic sentence given a list of terms when I was studying for my EMT license. At the time I leveraged a simple n-gram markov model that I based off the publicly available Cornell Movie script database.I added a couple settings like word order(matters: colors of the rainbow, doesn't matter: bones of the skull), anagram vs sentence, etc. At the time the biggest difficulty wasn't necessarily generating a coherent sentence - it was ensuring the "novelty" of the mnemonic. The less surprising the less likely its going to stick.Fun little tidbit - by adding a "NSFW" flag - I made it so the markov chain would heavily weight racy/saucy/lewd words. End result, VERY VERY evocative mnemonics that were completely and utterly incapable of being shared.Demo:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTAbVBOMdbk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, so feature rich, congrats on the release. Love that the mnemonic generation takes into account your existing memory anchors (didn’t know that term).I’ve actually been working on a similar-ish Anki Plugin for about 6 months - it can autogenerate any field via LLM in bulk, as well as images and TTS. I’m not explicitly  targeting the med school use case as much yours (I use it for language learning), and it’s more GUI centric/geared towards non-technical Anki users who don’t want to fiddle with a bunch of different API keys etc. Was planning to launch HN soon but you beat me to the punch!https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1531888719
https://smart-notes.xyz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool!Slightly off topic, but maybe an idea for someone to pursue... I figured out at a very early age that I could not memorize text in a script, or poetry, or even flashcards very well. But because I started playing piano at a very early age, somehow I could remember song lyrics verbatim. I could probably sing/recite at least 200 CDs worth of lyrics end to end.When I wanted to learn Spanish, memorizing songs was way more helpful than anything else I tried. Even if I didn't understand all the words at first, suddenly a lyrical phrase would become clear when I heard some of the words in a conversation.I'm not sure AI is up to writing really memorable songs yet. But for those of us with some kind of synesthesia, there could be lots of associations that aid memory, like colors, melodies or rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534931</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Nvidia Way" explores the business strategy and operational principles that have propelled Nvidia to the forefront of the tech industry, particularly in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence. It examines Nvidia's focus on innovation, strategic partnerships, and a strong corporate culture that prioritizes research and development. Additionally, the piece highlights the importance of adaptability and a long-term vision in navigating market challenges and maintaining competitive advantage, ultimately portraying Nvidia as a model for success in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just finished this book. I thought it was a great read, capturing most of the problems (with product, sales, marketing, competition) Nvidia faced in its life and how exactly the team solved them each and every time. It also goes into how the management, org structure, and culture have empowered its engineers to find creative solutions to staying alive in the brutal graphic chips industry and continuously discover and exploit new market opportunities.I learned a lot about how important not just superior technology, but better operations, marketing, sales, and culture are all critical to a successful business.The only con of this book is that it skips over some parts of nvidia’s history like the short-lived crypto boom, failed acquisition of ARM, etc. It’s still just a minor flaw in an otherwise great book though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hour long asianometry interview with the author that I enjoyed: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3vjGIZOSjLEIntel and AMD's recent missteps combined with that interview make me think that Nvidia will be in the lead for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the book is certainly a great read, I can't help but think that many people will try to replicate NVIDIA's culture (a la founder mode) when all they will do is replicate the effects/correlations and not the root causes.NVDA's success goes probably extremely deep into Jensen's character, the leadership team he built and the industrial context of the time. It is unclear to me how much of it is really useful in the foresight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42529564</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article serves as a comprehensive guide to mechanical keyboards, detailing their benefits, types of switches, key features, and considerations when purchasing one. It highlights the importance of factors such as switch type (clicky, tactile, or linear), form factor, build quality, and additional functionalities like customizable backlighting and programmable keys. The guide also provides recommendations for various budget ranges and usage scenarios, aiming to help readers make informed decisions about selecting the right mechanical keyboard for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In our relentless pursuit of the perfect interface between mind and machine, we build monuments to our own discontent. Each click, each tactile response, each millimeter of travel becomes a meditation on what we seek but cannot name. We spend fortunes to recreate the feeling of something we've never felt, chase echoes of satisfaction that fade with each new acquisition, and find ourselves surrounded by shrines to our own restlessness. In this symphony of springs and switches, we are all apprentices to an art that has no master.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As I've aged, I've developed kinetic tremor. In typing, this shows up as missing my intended target key. The error most commonly presents as hitting two keys at once because my ability to hit only within a defined x,y envelope at the keyboard plane has declined. Analyzing my typos, my intended key gets most of my finger, with adjacent keys getting tripped by ~10% - 20%, i.e., by the edge of my finger.I would love to find a keyboard that has keys at the usual pitch (I'm usually on Apple products), but that are smaller targets. I think this would result in fewer "out-of-bounds" adjacent key strikes. I've searched for such, no results so far. Any recommendations gladly received, thanks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much like musicians that have dozens of musical keyboards in their collection, I've collected/built dozens of mechanical keyboards over the years. I've got ones with nearly every general type of switch (including Topre).I like to tell people that - as a developer - I'll spend $400+ on a mechanical keyboard that makes the sound I like, and then use it alongside $500+ noise-cancelling headphones.But all of my mechanical keyboards sit on a display shelf unused today as I prefer to use the Lenovo TrackPoint II keyboard for all of my work (including coding). It's just the best keyboard ever made in my opinion, and I love using it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42507932</guid></item><item><title>36.

I suggest trying Phi 3.5 instead - it's effectively the same size (2.2GB from HF - Phi-3 Mini is 2.2GB as well) but should provide better results.If you have Ollama installed for that there are plenty of other interesting models to try out too. I like the Llama 3.2 small models, or if you have a whole lot of RAM (I use 64GB on an M2 MacBook Pro) you can run Llama 3.3 70B which is genuinely GPT-4 class: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the AI I am excited for. Data and execution local to my machine. I think Intel is betting on this with the copilot included processors. I hope ollama or other local AI services will be able to utilize these co-processors soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any other tools similar to pieces.app that are useful and preferably open-source, which can be integrated into the developer workflow?

&lt;p&gt;A group of editors from the journal "Evolution" has resigned en masse in protest of changes made by Elsevier, the publisher, which they believe compromise the journal's editorial independence and integrity. This mass resignation highlights ongoing tensions between academic publishers and researchers regarding editorial control and the quality of scholarly publications. The situation raises concerns about the broader implications for the academic publishing landscape and the potential impact on the future of research dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

These AI changes reversed the accepted versions of papers that had already been properly formatted by the handling editors. This was highly embarrassing for the journal and resolution took six months and was achieved only through the persistent efforts of the editors. AI processing continues to be used and regularly reformats submitted manuscripts to change meaning and formatting and require extensive author and editor oversight during proof stageI was the removal of proper nouns some sort of AI safety mechanism?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This tickles my sense of schadenfreude.&gt; The mass resignation is the 20th such episode since early 2023, according to our records. Earlier this year, Nature asked, “what do these group exits achieve?”I'm beyond flabbergasted that people don't yet know the cost of alienating their  truest believers with displays of rampant cynicism. To be clear I know nothing about this journal, but I do know that many companies are more eager than ever to see humans as replaceable with language models. Models don't have integrity though.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decision to install new stained glass windows at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, featuring designs by contemporary artist Claire Tabouret. This project aims to enhance the cathedral's aesthetic appeal while also honoring its historical significance. The colorful windows will be a modern addition to the iconic site, which was severely damaged in a fire in 2019, and reflect a blend of traditional artistry and contemporary creativity.

Even allowing for delayed reaction and effect in Sicily, it is surprising that such a proposal could have been taken very seriously in a place that boasts a great historical and artistic heritage.&gt; With these newest "additions," Cefalù Cathedral is being deprived of that opportunity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a standard test for this: The O'Connor Tweezer Dexterity Test.[1]
There's a board with small holes, a supply of metal pins, and a tweezer for putting pins in the holes. It's overpriced, because it's "medical".Some electronics assembly plants use such a test to screen new hires.Tweezer dexterity improves with practice. Hands are more precise than vision.
Looking through a microscope, you can position something within a thousandth of an inch with tweezers. This is familiar to anyone who's placed surface mount parts on a board by hand.[1] https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tweezer+dexterity+test&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gut reaction to the results: swearing because you feel you should have got it, and frustration because you feel it's too hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study appears to omit handedness as a potential factor influencing performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42527743</guid></item><item><title>42.

It uses no CPU.It also doesn't have all the memory leaks as the 3d pipes screen saver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My primary memory of this screensaver was while working as a desktop support work-study in college. Our NT 4 servers (PDC and its backup) ran the 3D pipe screen saver. I pointed out to the admin that it was using a software OpenGL renderer and so likely wasting CPU cycles. They then switched to the Star Field or maybe the blank screensaver (can’t remember now).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42507145</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My own N=2 study: Based on a random comment in an obscure forum, I cured my specific form of reflux for 10 years with a couple of simple stretches.I think they only address reflux due to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatal_hernia The theme is to physically push the stomach back down into place.The first exercise was to lay in bed, one hand over the other just below the sternum, push in and slide down slowly. Repeat 4 or 5 times. I felt my esophagus being stretched during this, which was quite an odd sensation. I did this each morning and sometimes at night.The second exercise needed the stomach to be filled with liquid. A bowl of cereal or a lot of water does the trick. Stand on your tip toes and fall down on your heels with a loud thud ten or so times. I did this once a day.It took about two and a half months to see results. But, I went from “These PPIs are not effective enough” to “I don’t need any pills” for ten years.Unfortunately, over the next ten years I gained a beer belly, the reflux returned, and I think the visceral fat is getting in the way of the manual manipulation exercise because I did not feel the stretch at all last time I tried the repeat the process. Maybe I should give it another go. But, mainly I need to lose the gut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this last year after going through some pretty weird oesophageal stuff, and I think if it did work it's almost certainly not because they provided the LES with "resistance training".A sphincter doesn't provide motility along the oesophagus, it tightens and contracts. The angle at which it does this is irrelevant.If this was indeed successful, a far more likely explanation is that doing this slowed down their eating and put less pressure on the smooth muscle function of the oesophagus during peristalsis and less pressure on the LES, allowing it some time to rest and perhaps get better at sphinctering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone please direct me to a picture / image / illustration / animated-gif of the position being referred to in the paper?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42528399</guid></item><item><title>44.

I realize this one is TS-first but most of the time loggers have about 6 methods on a core object, so that alone is not a compelling value prop to me.Even if I'm in the minority and TS-first is a significant value prop for many users, I think it would be worth nothing on the homepage why this is important for protective users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oo this is cool! Looking at some of the transports you built already, it looks fairly simple to do, but I'd appreciate a little documentation on how to BYOTransport (or at least once you think the api for that is solid)!Was just about to start adding a little more structure to my app's logging, so ill have to play with it then!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42508130</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not just you.I have an Ivy league degree, worked in deep learning since alexnet at a leading startup in the space, was a CTO of a startup that got acquired and have referrals from very senior people at the top FANG companies and still struggled to get interviews.I also have research scientist friends with Neurips papers, ones that solved long standing open math problems and even they are struggling to get hired.What me and my friends heard from a lot of people at the large companies was that many of them are no longer hiring in the US, but in India, Poland and Brazil instead, and that the roles they have listed in the US are for internal transfers. I've had a referral for Google for months and did not get an interview for NYC based roles, but when I went to an ML conference in Warsaw a few months ago I learned that Google is looking to hire 2000 people there, but with people in that office making ~1/4th of my friends in the US.On top of that you have a huge pool of bootcamp grads and foreign applicants so any role posted gets 1000s of applications in the first few hours, making it impossible for recruiters to look over all of them.And if that wasn't enough we're going through a huge hiring downturn post the COVID bump, see: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, this is what everybody I know is experiencing right now.Caveat lector: This is simply a retelling of my personal experience, YMMV. This is not advice.What has consistently worked for me: I stopped applying for jobs, and redirected all that effort into creating and publishing open source projects that demonstrate competence in the areas of work I want. And, just as importantly, I contribute to big established open source projects in those areas too.I did not apply for my current job (started 6 months ago): they solicited me, based on my open source work. All the best jobs I've had have been like that, this is the 3rd time it worked.When I'm unemployed, I only apply for jobs I actually want, typically spending an hour each on 0-2 extremely targeted applications per week. But I treat churning out new open source stuff as my full time job until somebody notices. In addition to successfully landing me three great jobs over the past decade, this approach has made me a much much better programmer.Also, I strongly believe spending hours a day writing new code will enhance your ability to pass technical interviews much more than gamified garbage like leetcode.A huge part of making this work is not living a typical valley lifestyle: I plan my life around the median national salary for a software engineer, and when I'm making more than that it all goes straight into my savings. In the bay, that requires living frugally (by bay standards...), but I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am to past-decade-me for living like that and giving today-me the freedom to turn down the bad jobs and wait for the good ones. Obviously, I don't have children.I do a lot more open source than a typical programmer in the valley, but I don't think I'm "exceptional" in any sense: you just have to put in the work. I do feel like I was very lucky to start my career in an extremely open-source-centric role, and in fairness that gives me a leg up here which I am probably inclined to underestimate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My thoughts from ~ 6 weeks ago:&gt;&gt; This is the toughest market I've ever seen. I easily made it to on-sites at FAANG a few years ago and now I'm getting resume rejected by no-name startups (and FAANG). The bar has also been raised significantly. I had an interview recently where I solved the algorithm question very quickly, but didn't refactor/clean up my code perfectly and was rejected.I've since landed one decent offer, but mostly got lucky (the sys design interview was about an obscure optimization problem that I specialized in for years - though I didn't let on that fact)Between that time, I failed multiple interviews (always solving the question, but never quickly or cleanly enough).Companies are incredibly slow to respond back (up to 4 weeks from time of application to first interaction with a recruiter).Some companies are incredibly demanding (recruiter screen -&gt; tech screen -&gt; tech screen -&gt; take-home test -&gt; group discussion about take-home test -&gt; behavioral / culture interview).Don't think it's about race. It's just an employers' market. And if you refuse to jump through the hoops, somebody else will.For reference, the last company on my resume is a top tier company that every recruiter has heard of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531830</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The phugoid is a type of oscillatory motion that occurs in aircraft during flight, characterized by variations in airspeed and altitude. This motion can be described as a continuous exchange of potential and kinetic energy, leading to a swings pattern where the aircraft alternates between climbing and descending phases while maintaining a nearly constant angle of attack. The phenomenon is generally caused by small disturbances in the aircraft's flight path and is an important aspect of flight dynamics, particularly in understanding how airplanes behave in response to pilot inputs and environmental factors. The article also discusses the mathematical modeling of phugoid motion and its implications for aircraft stability and control.&lt;/p&gt;

Ignore the Russian propaganda about "bird strikes" and "GPS spoofing", because their refusal to allow them to land at any of 4 airports in the area and sending them to Kazakhstan was intended to manipulate them into crashing into the Capsian to hide the evidence of their crimes. But fortunately, part of the aircraft and some of the passengers survived in spite of their attempts to murder them and then cover it up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, Captain of US Airways Flight 1549 that ditched in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, said in a Google talk that the landing could have been less violent had the anti-phugoid software installed on the Airbus A320-214 not prevented him from manually getting maximum lift during the four seconds before water impact."That's pretty interesting. Should pilots be able to disable all control-limiting software manually?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42508348</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I want is very simple: I want software that doesn't send anything to the Internet without some explicit intent first. All of that work to try to make this feature plausibly private is cool engineering work, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with implementing a feature like this, but it should absolutely be opt-in.Trust in software will continue to erode until software stops treating end users and their data and resources (e.g. network connections) as the vendor's own playground. Local on-device data shouldn't be leaking out of radio interfaces unexpectedly, period. There should be a user intent tied to any feature where local data is sent out to the network.So why didn't Apple just simply ask for user permission to enable this feature? My cynical opinion is because Apple knows some portion of users would instantly disallow this if prompted, but they feel they know better than those users. I don't like this attitude, and I suspect it is the same reason why there is an increasing discontent growing towards opt-out telemetry, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Users of my (free, open-source) app seem surprised to learn that we've got zero insight into usage patterns. There are situations where a small amount of anonymous telemetry would be extremely helpful but I'm not going to touch it with a barge-pole.Opt-in makes the data useless - not just in terms of the huge drop in quantity but because of the fact it introduces a huge bias in the data selected - the people that would opt-in are probably not a good sample of "typical users".Opt-out - no matter what safeguards or assurances I could provide is unacceptable to a subset of users and they will forcefully communicate this to you.Don't get me wrong - I understand both the ease at which bad actors abuse telemetry and the ease in which "anonymous data" can prove to be nothing of the kind in a multitude of surprising ways.But it's hard not to feel a little sad in a "this is why we can't have nice things" kind of way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Completely, 100% agreed:&gt; the only way to guarantee computing privacy is to not send data off the device.&gt; It ought to be up to the individual user to decide their own tolerance for the risk of privacy violations. [...] By enabling the "feature" without asking, Apple disrespects users and their preferences. I never wanted my iPhone to phone home to Apple.Regardless of how obfuscated or "secure" or otherwise "privacy-protecting" the feature is, the fact is that some information derived from one's personal content is transmitted, without prior consent.  Even if the information is protected, all network queries are information.  A timestamp that proves you took a certain action at a certain time (like taking a photo, assuming stuff is sent to this service immediately upon adding a new photo), from a certain location (by correlating your location information at that time), etc etc..  and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Transmitting information from a user's device without their explicit consent is a violation of their privacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42533685</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the efforts to port the Fish shell to Rust, detailing the advantages of using Rust for developing efficient, safe, and modern command-line tools. It outlines the reasons for choosing Rust, such as its performance benefits and strong memory safety features. The blog highlights the project's goals, including enhancing the existing Fish shell functionalities while maintaining its user-friendly experience. It also reflects on the challenges faced during the porting process and the collaborative nature of the development, inviting contributions from the community to further improve the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats to the fish team!  Great writeup with lots of interesting detail.I wonder if this is the biggest project that has moved from C++ entirely to Rust (or maybe even C to Rust?)  It probably has useful lessons for other projects.If I'm reading this right, it looks like fish was not released as a hybrid C++ / Rust program, with the autocxx-generated bindings.  There was a release during that time, but it says "fish 3.7 remains a C++ program" [1]It sounds like they could have released if they wanted to, but there was a last stage of testing that didn't happen until the end.Some people didn't quite get the motivation for adding C++ features to Rust [2], and vice versa, to enable inter-op.  But perhaps this is a good case study.It would be nice if you could just write new Rust code in a C++ codebase, without writing/generating bindings, and then throwing them away, which is mentioned in this post.---Also the #1 gripe with Rust seems to be that it supports version detection, not feature detection.But feature detection is better for distros, web browsers, and compilers:Feature Detection Is Better than Version Detection - https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Feature-Detection...Version/name detection is why Chrome and IE pretend to be Mozilla, and why Clang pretends to be GCC.  Feature detection (e.g. ./configure and eval() ) doesn't cause this problem![1] https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases[2] e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=safecpp.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember switching from bash to zsh a few years back and thinking I was the bees knees. After the switch trying other shells seemed like bike-shedding because, I mean, what more could a shell? Then I got a new computer and decided to start from scratch with my tooling and downloaded fish. I was shocked how it instantly made zsh feel cumbersome and ancient.Heartily recommend others give it a try as a daily driver for a couple of weeks. I liken it to Sublime Text: an excellent “out of the box” tool. Just the right amount of features, with the option to add more if you want. But you also don’t feel like your missing out if you keep it bare bones. A great tool in and of itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The one platform we care about a bit that it does not currently seem to have enough support for is Cygwin, which is sad, but we have to make a cut somewhere.&gt; We’re also losing Cygwin as a supported platform for the time being, because there is no Rust target for Cygwin and so no way to build binaries targeting it. We hope that this situation changes in future, but we had also hoped it would improve during the almost two years of the port. For now, the only way to run fish on Windows is to use WSL.I understand, but this is indeed incredibly sad.  To this day I still use Cygwin, and in fact prefer it to WSL depending on what I'm doing.  Cygwin is an incredible project that is borderline miraculous for what it accomplished and provides.  Without Cygwin I may not have any sanity left.  I can't exude enough love for the Cygwin team.Hopefully rust will support cygwin as a build target in the future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535217</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the journey of Joco, a company that nearly failed at launch but has since become a vital resource for e-bike delivery riders and has achieved profitability. Initially struggling with its market entry, Joco adapted its model to offer essential support and services tailored to the needs of e-bike riders, helping them navigate the challenges of their work. The company has successfully transformed its offerings, turning its initial missteps into a robust business that addresses the demands of a growing delivery economy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it really frustrating that the NYC DOT fought their original business model in order to protect Lyft’s monopoly. I had assumed that Lyft’s monopoly was on the right to use DOT’s street space for their program (which at least makes sense), but it feels like a bike rental service operating on private property should not be the DOT’s jurisdiction.The argument was essentially “we need to give Lyft a monopoly because that’s the only way they would invest in the system”, but the fact that Joco had a structural disadvantage (no public space) and was still willing to enter the market is a sign that we could have a competitive market without giving it all away to Lyft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t fully understand these kind of businesses especially in the “tech” space. I wonder if they paid for this article but I honestly don’t see the growth in these companies. They can be great businesses but not ones that would be posting in TechCrunch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; life cycle of the new Segway bikes is three to five years....then I guess it's promptly thrown off a bridge into the river. The idea that a bicycle lasts 3 years, even with hard, year-round riding, is from the disposable tech consumer mindset. A well maintained commuter bike - not an expensive one - lasts 10+ years. These aren't really bicycles, but computerized, electric mopeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42516268</guid></item><item><title>9.

It examines recent developments, including Iceland's efforts to harmonize its regulations with EU standards and public opinion trends towards EU accession.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article has some factual errors:&gt; By May 1992, the EEC had been renamed the EEA (European Economic Area) and all 7 member states of EFTA signed “The EEA Agreement” alongside the 12 member states of the EC.The EEC was not renamed the EEA. The Maastricht treaty (signed February 1992, effective November 1993) established the European Union (EU), and renamed the "European Economic Community" (EEC) to the "European Community" (EC). Alongside the EEC-now-EC, there was also the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, dissolved in 2002) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom, still exists), and the three linked Communities were known as the "European Communities", which was another expansion of "EC". And the EC formed one of the pillars of the European Union, until the Lisbon treaty (signed December 2007, effective December 2009) merged the European Community into the EU and it ceased to independently exist, although Euratom continues as essentially a subsidiary body of the EU. And then the EEA is a separate arrangement, established by a treaty between the EC, its member states, and the EFTA member states, signed May 1992, effective January 1994. So the EEC was not "renamed" to the EEA. The EEC/EC/EU and EEA are separate but overlapping arrangements – the EEA is geographically broader in scope, but topically narrower (certain EU laws and regulations are excluded from the EEA, and hence the EFTA states do not have to adopt them)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in favor of Iceland joining the EU should be honest and transparent that it's a pro inflation policy. In fact, Icelandic inflation would probably skyrocket.Why?Iceland's interest rate is 8.5% https://www.cb.is/other/key-interest-rate/EU's interest rate is 3% https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/ke...The higher Icelandic rate is set for Icelanders by Icelanders in order to bring their 4.8% inflation rate down to the 2.5% target.If Iceland adopted the EU's interest rate which is mainly set for France and Germany, that would be a 5% interest rate cut which is a massive stimulus. Icelandic inflation would skyrocket and there would be no chance of hitting the 2.5% target.People should also look into Optimal Currency Area theory popularized by Paul Krugman eg https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/0...The US Dollar works because of massive fiscal transfers from states on the coasts to states in the interior. The US also allows whole areas to deindustrialize like Detroit in order to solve the unavailability of currency adjustments between states.Are Icelanders willing to subsidize Greece? Are they willing to forgo their ability to devalue their currency like in 2008? Without devaluation that means deindustrialization.For all the above reasons, Iceland joining the EU would be the stupidest and most economically illiterate decision in it's history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the Arctic turning into the next shipping route, Iceland could turn to be the Singapore of the North Atlantic, a trading hub. I mentioned this to an Icelander a few months ago, and he said China recently asked if they could build a port in the north of the country...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539987</guid></item><item><title>10.

It’s meant to make a statement, but they have cherry-picked some extremely simple drugs to synthesize to make their point.I have some online friends who met through a forum for their rare condition. The forum they’re in had a splinter group dedicated to getting companies in China to synthesize experimental drugs for them that they couldn’t secure through normal channels, either because they hadn’t been approved yet or because they were expensive and off-label so nobody would even prescribe them.Even contracting with professional chemical synthesis operations in foreign countries turned out to be more difficult than they imagined. Several companies would take their deposit, then refund part of it after several months because they could never get the synthesis to work properly. They received one batch that tested as being so impure that it was useless.Projects like this convince people that all drugs are actually really easy to make, when in reality this project has carefully selected the most simple examples to make that misleading point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wouldn't be much easier to just not supporting the men that promised you to remove your healthcare?.Individually importing drugs (plus tariffs) from the other coin of the planet is an unnecessarily complicated way to hack this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We all know that custom, hand-made, artisan-crafted, boutique tools are always better than something factory made.Right. We all know the best chips in the world are made by local artisan silicon-etchers. None of that TSMC pasteurized crap. You simply can't beat a 1nm brush and a steady hand.

Can't we just sent that over radio instead?- There is all this decentralized renewable energy generation, we need a way to switch that off remotely if there is an overload in the grid - hey, we already have that hardware for swtiching streetlamps, let's just use that!Of course encrption was never a concern and now anyone could remotely turn off / on power generation. But for that to cause real trouble, you'd need coordinated action that would require something like a state level actor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TL;DR: by law, German power stations are required to "turn off" (taken off the energy grid) when they receive specific radio messages. This is intended for energy grid load balancing.Unfortunately, the message protocol is completely flawed security-wise, which allows malicious actors to control the power station.It would require only a handful of strategically placed senders to control an estimated 20 gigawatt of load Germany-wide, causing havoc on the European energy grid (brown-out, cascading effects, etc.).The security researchers followed a responsible disclosure towards the vendor, EFR, who reacted with sending letters from their lawyers.Today's SPIEGEL online news magazine pre-talk report ( https://archive.is/p66as ) on this topic cites EFR that the proposed  attack vector is not possible.The security researchers therefore made the last minute decision to go full disclosure with today's talk to press on the urgency of the topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saw this in person, awesome look at street lamp control and then walking that all the way up to "oops we figured out a way to attack the European power grid"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535622</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently, this is no longer the case, and the old emulated PDP-11 system was replaced with a new system in 2014–2016: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29157259The old system we are talking about here was Ericsson JZA 715, mostly written in Pascal with some parts in PDP-11 assembly, running under RSX-11M. Melbourne was the first site in the Southern Hemisphere for Ericsson's JZA series train control software, going live in 1982. JZA 715 first went live in Oslo in 1979. Earlier iterations of Ericsson's JZA software (JZA 410) went live in Stockholm in 1971 and Copenhagen in 1972.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Almost 20 years ago I worked for a company that was bidding on replacing the CRTs that had been rendering platform train information, which was spat out as a stream from said PDP11. I even went to Flinders St and got to see it.It was everything you imagine a 70s era data stream to look like. 1200bps, weird control sequences, etc., etc. And no-one could really tell us much about it, but there was some poorly photocopied incomplete documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe the PDP-11 is the one running the linked website.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42514553</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ability of large language models (LLMs) to accurately recall and interpret content from the Bible. It examines various factors that influence the models' performance, including the extent of their training data and the complexity of biblical text. The author highlights the challenges LLMs face in understanding historical and cultural contexts, as well as the potential for misunderstanding or misrepresenting biblical passages. Ultimately, the article questions the reliability of LLMs for biblical study and emphasizes the importance of human interpretation in understanding sacred texts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm learning New Testament Greek on my own*, and sometimes I paste a snippet in to Claude Sonnet and ask questions about the language (or occasionally the interpretation); I usually say it's from the New Testament but don't bother with the reference.  Probably around half the time, the opening line of the response is, "This verse is &lt;reference&gt;, and...".  The reference is almost always accurate.* Using a system I developed myself; currently in open development: https://www.laleolanguage.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I test new LLMs (whether SaaS or local), I have them create a fake post to r/AmItheAsshole from the POV of the older brother in the parable of the Prodigal Son.It's a great, fun test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems like LLMs would be a fun way to study/manufacture syncretism, notions of the oracular, etc; turn up the temperature, and let godhead appear!If there’s some platonic notion of divinity or immanence that all faith is just a downward projection from, it seems like its statistical representation in tokenized embedding vectors is about as close as you could get to understanding it holistically across theological boundaries.All kidding aside, whether you are looking at Markov chain n-gram babble or high temperature LLM inference, the strange things that emerge are a wonderful form of glossolalia in my opinion that speak to some strange essence embedded in the collective space created by the sum of their corpi text. The Delphic oracle is real, and you can subscribe for a low fee of $20/month!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42537332</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I bemoaned that humanity seems to be serving technology rather than the other way around. I argued that tech corporations have become too powerful and their power must be curtailed."That's a generic problem with corporatism and monopoly, not "tech".It shows up in "tech" because "tech" scales so well and has such strong network effects. But the US's tolerance of monopoly is the real cause. There need to be about four major players before markets push prices down. The US has three big banks, two big drugstore chains, etc.Tough antitrust enforcement would help. Google should be broken up into Search, Browsers, Mobile Devices, Ads, and Services, and the units prohibited from contracting with each other.Tough labor law enforcement would help. No more "gig worker" jobs that are exempt from labor law.
No more "wage shaving". No more unpaid overtime. Prorate medical insurance payments based on hours, so companies that won't pay people for more than 30 hours a week pay their fraction of medical insurance.
A minimum wage high enough that people making it don't need food stamps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; All of us must navigate the trade-off between “me” and “we.” A famous Talmudic quote states: “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am only for myself, what am I?” We must balance optimizing for oneself with optimizing for others, including the public good... To take an extreme example, Big Tobacco surely does not support the public good, and most of us would agree that it is unethical to work for Big Tobacco. The question, thus, is whether Big Tech is supporting the public good, and if not, what should Big Tech workers do about it.The duty to align your professional life ethically scales with your ability to do so. I personally don't cast aspersions on anyone working in tobacco farms or in a gas station selling cigarettes; they're just trying to get by. But if you're one or two levels up Maslow's Pyramid, it's right to weigh your personal needs against the impact of your work. You'll also be better off for it, knowing that the world would be worse off if you decided to switch gears and become a carpenter/baker/bartender/choose your adventure.I'll also say: there are ways to contribute morally outside of your 9-5. Volunteer to teach a neighborhood kid to code. Show your local sandwich shop how to set their hours online, or maybe even build them a cookie cutter Squarespace site. Donate a small fraction of your salary (eg 0.5% local, 0.5% global) to causes you believe in, and scale up over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our intelligence agencies have long recognized that individuals burdened by debt are vulnerable to coercion and manipulation. It's time we acknowledge that the H1-B visa program creates a similar dynamic. The program’s restrictive rules effectively hang over visa holders like the sword of Damocles, leaving them perpetually at risk and easily controlled.We’ve already seen how Twitter, under Musk’s leadership, has exploited this system to erode user protections in favor of appeasing his ego. When such moral compromises are normalized at the top, their effects inevitably cascade downward, influencing broader organizational norms and behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540862</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emergence and features of Bluesky, a new decentralized social media platform initiated by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. It explores Bluesky's goal to provide a more open and user-controlled social media experience, emphasizing its focus on user sovereignty, moderation, and reducing manipulation by platform owners. The author highlights the technological foundations that support Bluesky, such as the AT protocol, which allows for interoperability and greater freedom for users in managing their online presence. Overall, the piece sheds light on the potential impact of Bluesky in reshaping social media dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a huge BLuesky fan. I have switched my entire social experience to it. I get good engagement, mostly with seemingly decent people. I almost always can find interesting things to read.I have moderated the shit out of my feed. I rarely see things I do not want to (I had to give up politics and current events after the election). I use the list feature to curate separate feeds for different topics (music, programming, books, etc). I have started experimenting with graze.social to create my own algorithmic feeds.I have changed my handle to my own domain. One of these days I’m going to move my stuff to my own personal data store because it sounds like fun.Bluesky is also cool because of being the first mover/developer of AT Protocol. It’s my view that at:// will be a scheme that is as ubiquitous and important as http:// in a few years. That we will use it to login into stuff instead of facebook, google or github and that there will be numerous messaging things (including those sending money and other resources) based on ‘lexicons’ as well.There are problems, of course. It’s new and people are pressuring them to do viewpoint moderation which is a terrible idea. There are still many features that are missing.But, it’s a very fun platform with a lot less negativity than Twitter and a lot less bland stupidity than facebook. Threads is fine but it’s 100% zuckerberg’s feed. Tribal takes like four clicks to make a post. Mastodon is a bad UI and instances tend to be narrow-minded fiefdoms.Most of the comments on this thread are talking about what might happen, ‘enshitification’!! Oh My!. The actual fact is that it is a good thing presently and I hope decen people will flock to it and make sure it is supported to reach its maximum awesome potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is true but still, Bluesky enables things that X just cannot.I've spend hours building a website (1) that counts which members of the French parliament still actively tweet on X, and which actively use Bluesky.The "analyse.ts" script for X did have to go through scraping, in a real browser connected to a real account. It got blocked every 30 or so profile views...The Bluesky script was a delight, using the open no-credentials API (2).Of course the Bluesky company can shut down their website or their API. But still, what this openness permits today is a significant difference from what X ever permitted. Their abstractions will stay and could be leveraged by another company with a team of 10 experimented developers.1. The website is https://politix.top. Feel free to fork it for your own country. 
2. Here is the Bluesky script https://github.com/laem/politix/blob/master/analyseBluesky.t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;“you’re telling me there’s a @choldgraf@hachyderm.io and a @choldgraf@mastodon.social and they’re two different people?!”Yes, and choldgraf@gmail.com and choldgraf@ibm.com are different email-people, too. This is not a hard concept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539462</guid></item><item><title>18.

If we insist on pushing forward with GenAI we should probably at least make some digital or physical monument like "The Tomb of the Unknown Creator".Cause they sure as sh*t ain't gettin paid. RIP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m surprised to see no mention of AnythingLLM (https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm). I use it with an Anthropic API key, but am giving thought to extending it with local LLM.
 It’s a great app: good file management for RAG, agents with web search, cross platform desktop client, but can also easily be run as a server using docker compose.Nb: if you’re still paying $20/mo for a feature-poor chat experience that’s locked to a single provider, you should consider using any of the many wonderful chat clients that take a variety of API keys instead. You might find that your LLM utilization doesn’t quite fit a flat rate model, and that the feature set of the third-party client is comparable (or surpasses) that of the LLM provider’s.edit: included repo link; note on API keys as alternative to subscription&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone is looking for a one click solution without having to have a Docker running, try Msty - something that I have been working on for almost a year. Has RAG and Web Search built in among others and can connect to your Obsidian vaults as well.https://msty.app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539155</guid></item><item><title>19.

It is pretty impressive how they're running a hosting company while committed to the OpenBSD stack[1].[1]: https://openbsd.amsterdam/setup.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run my own email server and get nearly zero spam due to the simple reverse DNS check which catch most of them, rspamd catches the rest. I have about 50 000 emails in daily with about 500 delivered and in those 500 about 20 which are spam.Also, to remove the problem of false positive, refuse spam at the SMTP connection level and do not use a spam folder. This way users will get an MTA email in case of false positive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should probably have a [2019] tag, as things do change through time.I always enjoy the self-hosting explanations. Starting with mail is an interesting choice though. It's relatable to most people, but also very complex compared with a tougher DNS setup, DKIM, SPF, all that stuff.I'm not sure what the right approach is to maintain good security, and then open up the right ports for simple services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42536750</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a talk from the 36th Chaos Communication Congress (36C3) that focuses on the vulnerabilities in NATO radio encryption systems. The speaker discusses the technical aspects of various encryption algorithms used by NATO, highlights potential security flaws, and demonstrates how these weaknesses can be exploited. By dissecting specific case studies, the presentation emphasizes the importance of robust cryptography and the implications of insecure communication methods in military contexts. The overarching theme underscores the need for improved security measures to safeguard sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did the NSA not report this flaw to NATO before this became a standard? The NSA had differential cryptanalysis before anyone else. It is odd that they did not catch/report the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So you need 2 hours of both encrypted and unencrypted data at same time to make this attack work, is this feasible? And if you just flip the switch on devices to use more bits in the encryption the attack becomes unfeasible. Piss poor that NATO never replied to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those without a free hour to watch, here's the slide deck?I am not a cryptography or digital radio expert, so grain of salt and all that.Slide 14 shows real world feasibility, I think it's safe to say that while theoretically possible it's unlikely that this creates a significant real world issue.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For people who want to try making plasma from grapes in a microwave, here are the steps that work for me every time (I’ve done it for friends and highschoolers about 20 times)1. Cut a large grape (1.5cm diameter) partially in half, leaving just a sliver of skin connecting the two halves.2. Dry the cut sides by dabbing with a paper towel.3. Place the grape halves cut side down on a Pyrex dish. Keep the turntable in the microwave (important, since microwaves have hotspots). Place the dish with the grape so that the grape orbits inside the microwave.4. Microwave on high for 30s.If you don’t hear a hum and see sparks within 10 seconds, you may have too large a grape. In that case you can try splitting the grape into two quarters, connected by a thin sliver of skin. Don’t forget to dry all the cut sides!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every word in the title makes sense to me individually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This might be a good candidate for the 2025 Ig Nobel prize in physics [1].More seriously, NV centers are one of the most accessible quantum hardware platforms, and do very sensitive measurements on all kinds of interesting stuff.1. https://improbable.com/ig/about-the-ig-nobel-prizes/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42509760</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Hello, World! on z/OS" discusses the process of developing and running a simple "Hello, World!" program on IBM's z/OS operating system, targeting those interested in mainframe computing and software development. It walks through the setup, coding, and execution of the program, explaining key concepts and tools used in the z/OS environment, such as JCL (Job Control Language) and the necessary settings for compiling the code. The piece aims to demystify mainframe programming and encourage more developers to explore and embrace z/OS.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear in mind that IBM has been making computers — and terminology — since the 1950s. They invented hard drives. So it seems wrong to say their terminology has “diverged”…from what?IBM terminals like the 3270 operate almost like a web browser, with form fields implemented by the terminal. The computer sends a page of text, you use the terminal to edit it, and you submit data back. That’s why you have to move around the screen to type things in the right place, and thus why the editor has “line commands”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great missing manual for z/OS tinkering (in the past I have also given up at the login prompt as the author said). Can someone sort of "steel man" this z/OS workflow? e.g. correct noob problems and explain why creating a file takes a page of options? As it is, if this is actually the way to get started, I'm seeing no compelling reason for a developer to bother to learn or use z/OS.And I know you could say "well Linux is just as complicated." And maybe that's true, but I can also freely download it and learn it, whereas IBM seems to be making no effort to bring z/OS to the public, so why bother chasing it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mirrors my experiences with z/OS. One thing I distinctly remember was when I tried to write JCL to move some datasets. Took me 2 days reading documentation and trying out things. Finally I just gave up. It is not fun when you have noone to help and Google isn't very helpful. If you think Unix tools have no consistency, try JCL and z/OS. Considering how alien JCL is and magic incantations I invoked with it, I'm convinced that there is Cthulhu in the mainframe machine.Still, I'm quite proud I manage to write some JCL which saved us potentially days of manual work.Other things I remember from that time was that passwords were only 8 characters long and case insensitive. My guess is z/OS is secure only by its obscurity. Though maybe this was just our installation. No idea until today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42518953</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people at my local makerspace decided to build some of these "conestoga huts" to aid local homeless, which is basically a tiny househttps://www.communitysupportedshelters.org/conestoga-hutsas a shelter I would much prefer it over being homeless I guess, but there were issues- Being made primarily out of wood it was cheap and easy to build, but it was HEAVY. I guess this is a good thing once its placed somewhere but it took 6 men to get it onto a trailer and because everyone is a volunteer its not easy finding a time when that many people can show up just to move a house (the building was the fun part)- Where to put it? The city was more annoyed by our efforts (the actual organizers really since I just put in labor) than grateful because they started showing the houses off to people and saying "just as soon as the city tells us where to put it youll get a house"- security on these was decent,  I found out that primarily people wanted security from other homeless rather than even shelter- without power or plumbing its not clear to me how actually livable these things would be. Although it had 2 windows it was extremely dark insideOverall I think these types of houses are not solving the root issues - if the city decided to do it and found the land, it would be way better to just tack-weld some metal boxes together and weigh it down with concrete blocks. Then it takes specialists to build though and that sucks the spirit out of volunteers who want to spend a Sunday physically building something, not throw in $200 for a contractor to build 50 of them, even though that would obviously be of more help&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious question, is there any nuanced difference between "homeless" and "unhoused", or is it just a rebranding attempt (like spastic, then handicapped, then disabled, then differently abled, etc).I suppose in certain circles "homeless" leads to connotations of  drug use, dirtyness and crazyness, where as "unhoused" (to me at least) conjures and image of a regular person in a temporary situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;American style tent cities or Brazillian style shanty towns are not the solution.In my country there's a problem with providing shelters- you don't want to attract every Eastern European crackhead. On the other hand people have died and that's a bit embarrassing as well.The solution was those crazy Christians from the Salvation army. They don't ask for ID and they are a private initiative which allows for full plausible deniability from the government.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42541173</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s ancient history now but in 2012, the team behind the Paper drawing app for iPad shared interesting details about their color mixing: https://www.fastcompany.com/3002676/magical-tech-behind-pape...In short, they first implemented realistic pigment mixing behavior. But in user testing it turned out non-painters are not good at getting the color they want by mixing; you usually end up with brown. So they had to make an unrealistic mixing algorithm that felt more intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's very interesting!My first thought, looking at the webpage: "Huh, that's neat. I didn't know that painting software didn't even attempt to do color mixing beyond naive interpolation, though I guess it figures; the physics behind all the light stuff must be fairly gnarly, and there's a lot of information lost in RGB that probably can't be just reconstructed."Scrolling down a bit: "Huh, there's some snippets for using it as a library. Wait, it does operations in RGB? What's going on here?"Finally, clicking the paper link, I found the interesting bit: "We  achieve this by establishing a latent color space, where RGB colors are represented as mixtures of primary pigments together with additive residuals. The latents can be manipulated with linear operations, leading to expected, plausible results."That's very clever, and seems like a great use for modern machine learning techniques outside the fashionable realm of language models. It uses perceptual color spaces internally too, and physics based priors. All around very technically impressive and beautiful piece of work.It rhymes with an idea that's been floating in my head for a bit - would generative image models, or image encoder models, work better if rather than rgb, we fed them with wavelength data, or at least a perceptually uniform color space? Seems it'd be closer to truth than arbitrarily using the wavelengths our cone cells happen to respond to (and roughly, at that).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been around for a few years now, but it is doomed by a non-commerical/restrictive license.https://krita-artists.org/t/implementing-mixbox-mixing-for-k...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42544437</guid></item><item><title>28.

Minimal mobility. California had 500 distinct tribal groups before the Spanish arrived. The increased mobility allowed disease to wipe out about 90% of the indigenous peoples in North America before 1600.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calling the end of the Inca civilization a collapse fails to convey a fair bit of history.I expected a term that suggests destruction by invasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42519862</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Normally, you would see this screen that allows you to switch storage modesAnd back when PCs were far more open, good old IDE was always an option too.Ever since BIOS became EFI, and flash ROMs started getting much bigger, it seems they've not been adding functionality but removing it slowly. The excuse is often "security" (against the user), and "legacy" (the oldest interfaces are also the most widely understood and stable).That said, I'd stay away from the "prebuilt" manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc. if you want configurability. They've always had far less options in their BIOS than equivalent offerings from "enthusiast" or "gamer" oriented companies, although in the laptop space it's more difficult to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blame Microsoft.Across multiple laptops the Win 11 iso doesn't have Wifi drivers. And since we're in hell, you can't finish the setup process and actually use your computer without an Internet connection. Since then you'd be able to run an installer for the WiFi drivers.Luckily you can use an Android phone to create an Internet bridge which will allow you to proceed.However, The OEMs will automatically install CrapWare( we should start calling it this) even on vanilla Windows installs.Compared to my last few CachyOS installs where everything just works out of the box. I don't need to provide my email address to use my computer.Honestly as long as I can disable secureboot and install Linux it's ok. The moment I can't do this I'll be using legacy hardware ( or import a laptop from the EU where this is banned).Edit: Hopefully the EU will make secure boot an option we can disable...To be fair normal people don't care. My friend needed a new laptop, and since she's not too worried about the latest specs I just picked up what I could find at target for 300$. She is never going to reinstall. When Windows messes itself up in a year or two she'll probably just buy another 300$ laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We are slowly being boiled to the point of no return. We need some kind of consortium for users to represent our interests otherwise in 10 or 20 years we will have very limited choice when it comes to computer technology.For servers purchased in bulk by hyperscalers, OpenCompute has done a great job of coordinating owner requirements for hardware and firmware delivered by ODMs and silicon vendors in the server supply chain. Founded by Facebook, OCP built on the pioneering ethos of whitebox servers at early Google Search.To create a similar organization for clients, one would need to pool enough buying power to influence the supply chain for "PC" (x86/Arm) client devices. OCP bypassed Tier 1 OEMs and worked directly with Taiwan ODMs. This worked because hyperscalers could implement custom firmware and do their own support. The closest existing client vendor might be Framework, which has not yet managed open-source firmware. Plus Clevo (coreboot) OEMs. DMTF [2] might have some interest.A possible baby step towards open clients would be an OCP reference design for a "privileged access workstation" to access security-sensitive administrator web consoles for hyperscaler clouds. Include both a discrete TPM and an open silicon root of trust (OCP MS Caliptra or Google OpenTitan are both open firmware). AMD OpenSIL has promised OSS client firmware by 2026 and AMD mini-PC boards are everywhere. The building blocks are present for a high-integrity reference client with open firmware, under control of the client-owning cloud customer.With suitable licensing, anyone from Tier1 PC OEMs or small vendors could create custom derivatives of the OCP reference client IF they retain mandatory core properties like open firmware and open silicon RoT. We could intentionally reboot the accidentally-open IBM PC ecosystem, at least for the small niche of secure cloud administration.  If the OCP reference client is successful, it could motivate a new client-focused org for open client hardware.[1] https://www.opencompute.org[2] https://www.dmtf.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42542138</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques the BSD kqueue event notification interface, arguing that it is fraught with technical debt that complicates its use and maintenance. The author highlights issues such as inconsistencies in documentation, complex error handling, and its intricate API, which can lead to confusion for developers. It suggests that while kqueue offers powerful features, its design and implementation challenges can hinder its effectiveness and calls for improvements to enhance its usability and clarity in the programming community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I don’t doubt that the author has good reason for their opinion, the reason is handwaved here, no? Where is the tech debt? In the kernel only? Does it affect user space? For who is it more or less composable?I personally think ”async IO” (a term I don’t love, but anyway), should be agreed upon and settled across OSs. Not necessarily exact syscall equivalence, but the major design choices needs to be the same. For instance, who owns the buffers (kernel or user), and should it be completion or ready-based event systems?The reason I think this is so important to agree upon, is that language runtimes (and other custom runtimes like libuv) need to be simplified in order to allow for healthy growth. Any language that doesn’t have cross-platform support for ”async IO” is completely nerfed, increasing the barrier of entry for things that otherwise would be ”graduate level” projects, into deep OS/kernel knowledge that is hard to find outside FAANG and a few other spaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the argument is that extending kqueue's interface to handle more and more event is worse than turning more and more events into xxxfd subsystems. Why is that worse, again? Like, not in "it's not a composable design" abstract sense but in concrete "you can't do this and that, which are useful things" sense?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counterpoint -- epoll is fundamentally broken: https://idea.popcount.org/2017-02-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-...You can end up with events on file descriptors that you don't even have open -- they leak across process boundaries. And that means that if the file descriptor gets reused, you can end up with events on the wrong file descriptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540442</guid></item><item><title>31.

Otherwise it's technically not usable.[1]: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/scripts/index.htm#EasyWin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to use AltSnap (https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) which works extremely well, and supports template snap zones.Recently I wrote my own and now use that daily instead, which supports similar functionality (alt+drag) but also "zooming" in/out and panning around the desktophttps://github.com/sebmaynard/DPaZ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;when i see i3, i expect it to be tiling window manager. this is not it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42536181</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a Racket package that facilitates the embedding of images directly within source text files. It allows programmers to incorporate visual content into their Racket code, enhancing documentation and presentations. The package supports various image formats and provides functions to manage and render these images seamlessly, ensuring that the images remain linked to the code even when shared or processed. The README includes installation instructions, usage examples, and details on how to contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's doing this only because Racket has the unusual feature of supporting images as "self-eval" values in the source code.In other languages, all you'd want is the byte string (maybe BASE64-encoded, maybe with byte escape sequences), and you wouldn't need a fancy reader extension: just put a byte string literal.A variation on the byte string literal you might see is when people create a minilanguage out of strings.  For example, if you want to represent a 2x pixel map image with a fairly small color map... you might just have a string literal of ASCII characters for each row, where each ASCII character maps to an RGB color (or transparent) that you specify, with a simple function to translate it to binary.  Then it looks like ASCII art in your source code.Vector images, OTOH, are more likely to have a textual language already (e.g., SVG), so of course you can just embed that as strings in your source file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like these kinds of ideas. I've spent a lot of time thinking about similar ones. Here's my rough translation of this particular concept to Emacs:    (defun imagify-buffer ()
      (interactive)
      (font-lock-ensure)
      (save-excursion

              (goto-char (match-beginning 0))
              (kill-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0))

This adaptation hooks onto an Emacs language mode—Emacs Lisp mode, in this snippet—and searches for, and translates, a regex syntax (%image) appearing in the comments section. This piggybacks on the language mode's own parser (the 'font-lock-comment-face thingy). The image-handling part is core Emacs functionality; like DrRacket it does support these things natively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish IDEs would support showing images inline in code. I can't count the number of times I've wanted to include a nice diagram in a comment but I instead had to resort to describing the diagram with words, or a shitty ASCII art diagram.There's a very long standing VSCode issue for this.https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/3220&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521493</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experience with managing cloud infrastructure costs, specifically focusing on the impact of using availability zones. It details the challenges faced when utilizing Prometheus for monitoring and the subsequent shift to a more cost-effective solution. The author shares insights on how availability zones can lead to unexpected expenses, emphasizes the importance of efficient resource management, and provides lessons learned about optimizing cloud budgets. Overall, the piece serves as a cautionary tale for engineers and organizations using cloud services to be mindful of expense management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This excessive inter-AZ data transfer pricing is distorting engineering best practices. It _should_ be cheap to operate HA systems across 2-3 AZs, but because of this price distortion on inter-AZ traffic charges, we lean towards designs that either silo data within an AZ, or that leverage S3 or other hosted solutions as a sort of accounting workaround (i.e. there are no data transfer charges to read/write an S3 bucket from any AZ in the same region).While AWS egress pricing gets a lot of attention, I think that the high cost of inter-AZ traffic is much less defensible. This is transfer on short fat pipes completely owned by Amazon. And at $0.01/GB, that's 2~10X what smaller providers charge for _internet_ egress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used VictoriaMetrics in past (~4 years ago) for collection of not just service monitoring data but also for network switch and cell tower module metrics. At the time I found it to be the most efficient Prometheus-like service in terms of query speed, data compression and, more importantly, being able to handle high cardinality (over 10s or 100s of millions of series).However, I later switched to Clickhouse because I needed extra flexibility of running occasional async updates or deletes. In VictoriaMetrics you usually need to wipe out the entire series and re-ingest it. That may not be possible or would be quite annoying if you are dealing with a long history and you just wanted to update/delete some bad data in a month.So, if you want a more efficient Prometheus drop-in replacement and don't think limited update/delete ability is an issue then I highly recommend VictoriaMetrics. Otherwise, Clickhouse (larger scale) or Timescale (smaller scale) has been my go to for anything time series.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see a comparison with Mimir. Some of the problems that this article describes with Prometheus are also solved by Mimir. I'm running it in single binary mode, and everything is stored in S3. I'm deploying Prometheus in agent mode so it just scrapes and remote writes to Mimir, but doesn't store anything. The helm chart is a bit hairy because I have to use a fork for single binary mode, but it has actually been extremely stable and cheap to run. The same AZ cost saving rules apply, but my traffic is low enough right now for it not to matter.  But I suppose I could also run ingesters per AZ to eliminate cross-AZ traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42513809</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recall, pre-iPhone, sitting in a pub waiting for a friend to arrive, staring into the middle-distance.  I noticed a young man sitting at the bar with a phone.  He'd pick it up, check for messages, put it down, take a sip of beer then his leg would start to judder (he was on a bar stool), then repeat the whole thing.  A cadence of around 45s.  "What a weirdo" I thought to myself.  Turns out I was the weirdo, heh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Methodology&gt; Reviews.org surveyed 1,000 Americans 18 years and older with a +/- 4% margin of error and a confidence level of 95%. The survey results were weighted to reflect characteristics of the United States population using available data from the US census.Absent them explicitly saying otherwise, I think we need to assume that the survey was done of reviews.org visitors. Reviews.org has reviews for exactly three categories of services: internet providers, mobile phone plans and services, and TV and streaming.Weighting for US demographics isn't going to make this sample very representative—this survey is of people who are browsing reviews for a set of products that most people don't think too hard about, which also happens to be a set of products that is tightly related to screen time use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my favourite achievements of the past several years has been to actively NOT use my phone.I started by eliminating social media accounts, which had an immediate and positive effect on my phone use.Next, I set hard phone time/day limits: no phone while hiking, no phone while at a social meetup or restaurant, no phone while shopping.Finally, I focused on what I should use it for and stuck to only that: checking work email when I need to away from a PC (but replies wait until I get to a PC), the odd Googling when I'm away from a PC, scrolling my tech news feeds once per evening for up to 20 minutes, and of course, missed phone calls/texts from friends and family (checked periodically, 1-2 times per day).And the end result? I'm very happy with my relationship with this non-invasive piece of technology, mainly because I ensured it was non-invasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539474</guid></item><item><title>37.

That documents all the varieties, together with which countries/states/cities you can find them in?When I travel, discovering new fruits is one of my favorite parts. Like when I discovered the custard apple [1] in Brazil, it blew my mind.And it would be really cool to have a list of all the fruits you could buy when you travel to make sure you don't miss any. Or the fact that the article says tejocotes are sold in NYC -- when I've never come across them -- makes me wonder what other fruits are here that I also had no idea?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annona_squamosa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article tldr:"Authorities were worried that tejocotes could carry highly destructive fruit flies into the States, threatening domestic orchards. Soon, there was a black market for the golden fruits, due to their rarity and the effort it took to bring them over the border."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP 99¢ Only StoresThey always had tejocote, and at a great price.

I don't know if Hong Kong students have to spy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soon enough anything that is even remotely a security threat (pretty much any non-trivial app) will require clearance and in office work.The North Korean hacks into several companies are an example of how bad it is now, add in some good deep fake technology and soon you will not be able to distinguish who is actually working for your company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work with a few Israeli software engineers who did this openly and told me all about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540427</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Few of us want to be making manual HTTP calls out to APIs anymore. These days a great SDK, not a great API, is a hallmark, and maybe even a necessity, of a world class development experience.I'm of the opposite mind. A simple API that I can just call with Fetch is far better than having to learn most SDKs. Stripe's Node.js SDK is fairly clean/without headaches, but I look at stuff like the AWS JS SDK and want to gouge my eyes out.At least with an HTTP API, there's some modicum of standardization. SDKs are and will always be the wild west. The only exception with this that I see frequently is authentication. Some are simple Authorization headers w/ a Bearer &lt;Token&gt;, others (like PayPal the last time I implemented it) require an undocumented base64 encoding of the token.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The new API is trying to move away from a model where subobjects in an API resource are expanded by default, to one where they need to be requested with an include parameter. We had plenty of discussions about this before I left.This feels like the worst middleground between REST and GraphQL. All of the data flexibility of GraphQL with the static schemas of REST. Wasn't this kind of thing the whole idea underpinning GraphQL?Maybe you can get around this with new SDK generators handling type safety for you, but I am definitely not looking forward to trying to understand the incomprehensible 5 layers of nested generics needed to make that work.I remember looking up to Stripe as pioneers of developer experience. This reads like a PM with their back against the wall with a mandate from above (make requests n% faster) rather than a developer-first design choice made to help people build better systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; These days a great SDK, not a great API, is a hallmark, and maybe even a necessity, of a world class development experience.IMO, you can't build a great SDK without a great API. Duct tape only goes so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42544115</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article tells the story of stents, emphasizing their development and evolution in the field of medicine. It explores the origins of stents, highlighting key inventions and the technology behind them, while detailing their critical role in treating cardiovascular diseases. The narrative also covers the impact of stents on patient outcomes and advancements in design that have improved safety and efficacy. Overall, the piece serves as a comprehensive overview of how stents have transformed medical practices and patient care in the treatment of artery blockages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting chaser to this is the centrality of stents in discussions of provider-side abuses in the US health care system: I'm sure stents save a lot of lives, but there's broad agreement that they're also significantly overprescribed. Ironically, one of the things the US health care system does with extraordinary effectiveness --- making it quicker and more efficient to deliver services, in this case by placing stents in outpatient procedures --- also makes it easy for them to drive costs.None of this has anything to do with Malik's own story! I'm glad for his experience with our system, one I'm increasingly mindful of as I'm just a decade or so behind him.https://lowninstitute.org/the-prevalence-and-harm-of-unneces...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My FIL was stented and dead a week later from a massive clot which migrated post stent and blew his mind to pieces. It wasn't a good end. Stents are great and stents are also risky.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the use of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in software development, particularly within web applications using PHP and MySQL. The author critiques DDD for its complexity and argues that it may not be suitable for smaller projects. Instead, he advocates for simpler approaches that focus on practical solutions and emphasizes the importance of scalability and maintainability. The article suggests that the challenges posed by DDD can lead to increased development time and unnecessary complications, encouraging developers to consider alternative methodologies that better align with their project needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539477"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;DDD is one of the most misunderstood "patterns" I've encountered. I started my career in the late 00s, and Evans' DDD/Fowler's PoEAA were treated by gospel as some, and I couldn't quite understand why. With years of experience, I now get it: software being built in 2003 was a lot different than software today.DDD/PoEAA implicitly are about building long-lived, stateful thick clients -- i.e. a Java/C++ desktop application, because that's what people built by default in 2003. In the past 22 years, things have changed. The Bezos "API mandate" has either explicitly or implicitly been adopted by many organizations. Front-ends are much more likely to be websites/Chromium operating with stateless HTTP requests, instead of long-lived desktop applications. (React has "won" as the default JS framework over the past 10 years, and that has its own set of architectural patterns which don't mesh with DDD.) Backend software is built with a cloud-first mentality: servers can fall over at any minute, the application should scale up by adding more servers, etc...All this leads to a much different approach. Statelessness is nonnegotiable, since you're dealing with stateless HTTP/GRPC requests that expose most or all of your functionality. The "anemic domain model"[0] is derided as an antipattern by DDD, yet it's the most sensible approach for dealing with objects that get loaded and disposed of with every request. Complex ORM schemes and patterns like "unit of work" are fine when dealing with small amounts of data, but break down when you start needing to care about e.g. splitting transactions into smaller chunks because writing 200,000 rows in a single tx is a bad idea.I don't think DDD is useless, but its application is much narrower than advertised. It's a shame that even today people are still being taught from DDD as if it's the "right" way to code when for a large amount of modern software it's a terrible fit.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found the original book to be rather dry and difficult to read. Like most books on software design. It’s full of hand waving and folk tales.However I think there are some good nuggets in it that are worth taking away and using. The idea of ubiquitous language is useful. The best software teams I’ve worked on were great at talking with business users and customers. A ubiquitous language helped us avoid “programmer speak,” where we talked using names for things nobody had heard of but us and nouns and concepts nobody else understands. It allowed us to communicate more precisely and avoid mistakes throughout the process.Good article. There’s always going to be counter-points and folks who prefer one way over another. I think there are some useful nuggets in this one too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I learned more about what DDD is from this article than most of my books on DDD. This is the right way to do a critique -- it starts out with an excellent Steel Man understanding of DDD and proceeds from there.I guess they don't make em like they did in 2018 anymore!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539477</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something similar happened to me: got a job offer many months ago from someone on LinkedIn that I don't know... though these things happen a lot. My title back then had web3 and Solidity developer in the name. He sent me the link to a Git repo for an NFT marketplace, a simple React app. He told me that the previous dev quit and someone needs to complete the unfinished project. I downloaded the code but opened in a VM, which turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life without even realizing it.When I ran the app some parts seemed broken as expected everything was otherwise normal. He then asked me that whether I'm running in a VM or not and some features wouldn't work in a VM and I should have ran on my actual computer. It was an immediate red flag (why would a React app need that?). I checked running processes on the VM and saw a Python instance. When I examined the opened files it pointed to a suspicious file, and it was a fresh VM and nothing in the project setup needs Python for anything. Then I zipped the project, sent it to ChatGPT and asked about malware, and it found a totally obfuscated dev-targetting malware-downloading script disguised as error handler middleware. If I ran it on my machine, it could have stolen at least a thousand bucks from my local crypto wallets: I checked the payload code via HTTP interception and realized that the script sends any private keys for crypto wallets to its own server, and I'd never be sure of my system again anyway.I've warned the hosting company (though it seemed like a very cheap and sketchy one anyway), and I found out that the person on LinkedIn has blocked me in the meantime.These are very real threats, be careful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The report[0] it links to goes into more detail (in Japanese), and gives the file hash values and domains it accesses.[0] https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-otter...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517480</guid></item><item><title>44.

Or did we just not yet collectively have enough experience to know that auto saving was something critical to writers…?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The Lanier machine, which sells for about $12,000, takes up about the same amount of desk space as an electric typewriter but is taller by a foot or more because of the cathode-ray display screen.It is amazing how much the price of word processors has declined over the years. It has dropped from $12,000 to free, provided you have a PC on which to run it:https://www.openoffice.org/product/writer.htmlI wonder if President Carter had to pay for his or if it was free for him given that having him use it was likely was a great advertising opportunity at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's this 1979 model:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a disturbing trend in Mexican prisons where inmates engage in a violent game called "poleana," which involves a rope or chains and can lead to serious injuries or death. This brutal pastime reportedly serves as a form of entertainment among prisoners, reflecting the dire conditions and lack of control within the penal system. The piece highlights concerns over prison management and the safety of inmates, as well as the broader implications for criminal justice in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an insightful analysis of China's geopolitical strategies, economic growth, and social dynamics, highlighting its influence on global politics and trade. It discusses China's historical context, its rise as a superpower, and the implications of its actions on international relations. The notes also touch upon critical issues such as human rights, technological advancements, and the Belt and Road Initiative, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges posed by China's increasing prominence in the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"One explanation I heard while there is that there are plenty of menial jobs available, but today's educated youth - who've gone through high school and college - just won't take the low-skilled positions their parents and grandparents did. Meanwhile, there's a real shortage of the high-skilled jobs that would actually match their education and aspirations. It's a mismatch between the jobs available and the jobs young people feel qualified for and willing to do."Same problem the US has. Too much education for the job market. Only about half of US college graduates have jobs that actually need a college education. The last time China had this problem, Mao said "It is very necessary for the educated youth to go to the countryside and undergo re-education by poor peasants." 40 million students were rusticated.Historically, this leads to unrest. Egypt hit this, with good education but, especially post oil boom, not many jobs that needed it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious what led to the decision to use "burner" devices, was it fear of confiscation? I spent 2 weeks in China in 2024 (Tianjin, Tangshan, Chengdu, and Beijing), used Astrill as my VPN on my iphone and macbook pro and didn't experience any connectivity issues or app crashes. I even had a 45min signal voice call with someone state side. I was using Astrill's VIP add-on however.&gt; It's a good reminder that what's lacking in life is not time. It's focus. If you're working on what matters, you can advance leaps and bounds in 8 hours. And if you're just clearing the slog, you can spend a lifetime staying in the same place.This. Incredibly obvious yet incredibly difficult to put into practice day-to-day. Another underrated perk of traveling internationally. All of a sudden, trivial nonsense starts to reveal itself through absence, allowing you to sort accordingly - carries over when you're at your home-base as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; These endless rows of skyscrapers, put up in the construction frenzy of the last few decades, are uglyAnd dangerous, and won't last more than a few decades. Just watch some of the tofu dreg videos https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1eyUAZCb3sA&gt; There were very few foreigners. In Beijing I might have seen half a dozen cumulatively across entire seas of peopleMost foreigners from US and Europe have left after the COVID lockdown - they've seen with their own eyes the true nature of authoritarian/dictatorship regime.  Also, the closer relationship of Russia and China has many unable to stomach supporting a regime that attacks Ukraine, another democracy.  The foreigners are now from Africa, Middle East, or Belt and Road countries.&gt; Outside of Shanghai, almost nobody spoke English.This is why China will be irrelevant in a few decades, as it recedes into its own shell.  When most export manufacturing will have moved to Southeast Asia, when domestic goods is preferred over foreign goods, when export dwindles due to sanctions and tariffs, when it gets harder to harder for average citizens to obtain passports.  China will be closed off just like the 18th century, just how Xi Jing Ping wants it.&gt; many young people expressed feeling stressed or overwhelmedImagine that you just graduated, and no one is hiring in your fields.  And you can only drive didi or meituan, but the pay is decreasing fast, and there are 20+ idle drivers at lunchtime every day, and you are only making $300/month.  And next year, there will be another 12+ million graduates - the size of the entire population of Sweden.  You are trying to look for a job in another country, but travelling outside the country is discouraged and passports are hard to get.&gt; The biggest surprise from talking to Chinese VCs people at AI labs was how capital constrained they feltChina’s startup scene is dead as investors pull out—’Today, we are like lepers’

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even before we had the big companies doing it an HOA I lived in put in a lot of work to ban short term rentals and establish some rules for subletting.We had two condos that were constantly some kind of party house folks would rent, a few others that were more occasional.  Visitors would leave trash out, park in other people's spots, loud at all hours.  They didn't care, none of their mess had any impact on the visitors so they did whatever they wanted.   The handful of folks renting out what were all of 6 or so units were very vocal trying to lower HOA fees and so on ... they didn't care about long term sustainability of the road in our neighborhood or maintaining the lawn or even insurance coverage.Had to go through a lot of work establishing new rules and getting everyone to vote on it but it was worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially, a big reason I dislike hotels particularly the UK is the trend of removing windows that open and generally getting sick from the rooms. Lots of fire retardants, plus the residual cleaning chemicals in the sheets. The more modern or renovated a hotel, the more likely this isI often get chest pains and watery eyes from hotel rooms, compounded by the lack of fresh airAll because the hotel wants to save a few £ in case someone leaves the window open with the aircon onAnd the reason fire retardants are so heavily used is because the chemical companies heavily lobbied for it years ago, plus manufacturers love being able to use cheaper materials and methods then just dousing in a cheap chemical to achieve the specification&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The argument in the article seems to be that supply-side arguments (there aren't enough homes) don't explain housing prices, but would it not make sense that in this case there aren't enough hotels/short term condos, etc?I admit I am biased, I usually hate staying in hotels and when I'm traveling I often want to be near family, so a house or apartment nearby where I can walk is better than a hotel where I have to drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42542516</guid></item><item><title>49.

It's just a different media animal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would love to have more outdoor cinema here.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how McKinsey &amp; Company has significantly influenced the decline of the middle class in America through its consulting practices. It highlights the firm's role in promoting cost-cutting measures and outsourcing that have led companies to prioritize short-term profits over long-term stability, resulting in job losses and wage stagnation for many workers. The piece critiques the broader impact of management consulting on corporate America, suggesting that McKinsey's strategies have contributed to rising inequality and harmed the economic landscape for the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked with John for a few years in the 1990s. This was during the heyday of BBSes, when he joined our small team at Mustang Software after Mustang bought Qmodem. John moved to Bakersfield California (with his family, including OP!) to be with us. John left a few years later due to I think business differences with management.John was personable and full of joy. He always loved a good joke. I remember the parties (not wild, we were pretty tame back then) we would have around the pool at his place. He was generous with his time.The story of Qmodem itself was a bit different. Qmodem for DOS was a one-man shareware business and was John's pride and joy. It was clear that he poured everything into that program. It was finely tuned and just worked. Times were changing though, and people were calling for a Windows version. Unfortunately, John was not interested in learning Windows programming, so Scott Hunter (now at Microsoft), Dan Horn, and I built Qmodem for Windows. It was good, but it really never had the same level of polish that John's work did. It was "Qmodem" in name only.After John left Mustang he also left Bakersfield and I lost touch with him. I'm sure he continued to make the people around him smile. Thank you for your time and contributions, John.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm so sorry for your loss.Your father's contributions are immeasurable. Just reading the word "QModem" gave me an instant flashback to my youth. QModem was my gateway to the outside world.I grew up way out in the country. I was the 80s and I was pretty isolated from technology and didn't even know anyone who cared about it at first. I started tinkering with our home PC, and I finally purchased a modem and figured out how to connect to BBSs. This changed my life. I had many sleepless nights as teenager, connecting everywhere I could. QModem was like a fancy car that drove me anywhere I wanted to go.I became obsessed with learning and tweaking things. AT commands, autoexec.bat, QModem scripting. Whatever I could figure out to get maximum performance and fast download speeds. Because of Qmodem, I could download games, text files, and even talk with other people. This moment in time defined my future. I knew right then what I wanted to do with my life.I owe thanks to your father and what he built for my wonderful career, and 40 years of enjoying technology. Without something as easy to learn and reliable as QModem, who knows what path my life would have taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;John helped get me and my college roommate started with Linux system administration and web development three decades ago. We both grew up in in the town in Iowa where John lived, and my roommate had met him around the time we went to college in the mid nineties. We were both nerdy engineering majors who had gotten exposed to Unix through our college dial-up shell accounts, and we had managed to scavenge together enough computer parts — an old 386 motherboard, a discarded hard drive that just needed a molex connector soldered back onto it, a spare floppy drive — to assemble a computer just barely capable of running Linux.I remember lugging it all over to John’s basement where he helped us install Slackware Linux from a giant stack of 5 1/4 floppies he had.Later, when John was running up a dial-up ISP in town, he let us park that server at his ISP, so we had a full Linux server of our own connected to a T1 with its own public IP address, and where we had root access and could experiment with running our own web and email servers and other such things. Back then in dial-up days, having a Linux server of our own on the Internet seemed unbelievable, and I will always be deeply appreciative to John for that opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42551900</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Curl-impersonate is a tool that enhances the curl command by allowing users to easily impersonate a browser's user agent, effectively mimicking browsing behavior. The project aims to facilitate web scraping and automate interactions with websites by providing a simple way to pass in browser-specific headers and manage cookies. The repository includes installation instructions, examples of usage, and relevant documentation to help users get started with this enhanced curl functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The same author also makes a Python binding of this which exposes a requests-like API in Python, very helpful for making HTTP reqs without the overhead of running an entire browser stack: https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffiI can't help but feel like these are the dying breaths of the open Internet though. All the megacorps (Google, Microsoft, Apple, CloudFlare, et al) are doing their damndest to make sure everyone is only using software approved by them, and to ensure that they can identify you. From multiple angles too (security, bots, DDoS, etc.), and it's not just limited to browsers either.End goal seems to be: prove your identity to the megacorps so they can track everything you do and also ensure you are only doing things they approve of. I think the security arguments are just convenient rationalizations in service of this goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some example sites where this is both necessary and sufficient? In my experience sites with serious anti-bot protection basically always have JavaScript-based browser detection, and some are capable of defeating puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth even in headful mode. I doubt sites without serious anti-bot detection will do TLS fingerprinting. I guess it is useful for the narrower use case of getting a short-lived token/cookie with a headless browser on a heavily defended site, then performing requests using said tokens with this lightweight client for a while?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The build scripts on this repo seem a bit cursed.  It uses autotools but has you build them in a subdirectory.  The default built target is a help text instead of just building the project.  When you do use the listed build target it doesn't have the dependencies set up correctly so you have to run it like 6 times to get to the point where it is building the application.Ultimately I was not able to get it to build because the BoringSSL disto it downloaded failed to build even though I made sure all of the dependencies the INSTALL.md listed are installed.  This might be because the machine I was trying to build it on is an older Ubuntu 20 release.Edit: Tried it on Ubuntu 22, but BoringSSL again failed to build.  The make script did work better however, only requiring a single invocation of make chrome-build before blowing up.Looks like a classic case of "don't ship -Werror because compiler warnings are unpredictable".Died on:/extensions.cc:3416:16: error: ‘ext_index’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]The good news is that removing -Werror from the CMakeLists.txt in BoringSSL got around that issue.  Bad news is that the dependency list is incomplete.  You will also need libc++-XX-dev and libc++abi-XX-dev where the XX is the major version number of GCC on your machine.  Once you fix that it will successfully build, but the install process is slightly incomplete.  It doesn't run ldconfig for you, you have to do it yourself.On a final note, despite the name BoringSSL is huge library that takes a surprisingly long time to build.  I thought it would be like LibreSSL where they trim it down to the core to keep the attack surface samll, but apparently Google went in the opposite direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42547820</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, I've not heard of this one before. Most of the emulation community has settled on 'Winlator' as the main android windows emu of choice. Before this it was Exagear, but winlator is easier to get started with. Another route is using proof termux with a DE like xfce and connecting with X but not sure how good this setup is for pure gaming performance, but may be a good option for Dev work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great!  There are so many fantastic Windows games from the pre-smartphone era, before ads, in-app purchases, etc. came along and ruined things.BTW if you liked X-Com: UFO Defense and want a blast from the past, try out The X-Com Files[1].  It runs on the Android build of OpenXcom[2], and it's not terribly difficult to set it up to sync Savegames between Android and your desktop.[1] https://openxcom.org/forum/index.php?topic=4595.0[2] https://openxcom.org/forum/index.php/topic,5258.0.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this work? Does it run the x86_64 version of Wine in Box64? My understanding of wine was that it just translates API calls, shouldn't it work on any ISA then? (Or is most of a program / game math and that stuff would fail?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42547610</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the "Zombocom Problem," a concept stemming from a website known for its absurdity and simplicity, which presents a seemingly infinite, unproductive loop of options that lead nowhere. It explores how this problem reflects broader issues in decision-making and the concept of choice fatigue, where excessive options can paralyze individuals rather than empower them. The author uses humor and philosophical reflections to consider the implications of living in an age filled with infinite possibilities, highlighting the importance of finding clarity and making meaningful decisions amidst the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This may be a bit of an old allusion, but Lotus Notes is a great example of this. Notes is fundamentally a programmable, non-relational, client/server replicated database with a UI on top of it. It's a workflow engine for accomplishing whatever business processes a company might have that can be made to keep working pretty well when the client computer is offline. It can be anything.But it is remembered first and foremost as an email system, a feature that's fairly trivial to implement once you have a replicated database and a UI on top of it that can display lists and text. But it had to be an email system first because you can't sell something that can do anything if it doesn't do anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember, when I was just starting, the founder of the company saying that if you tell him you're offering an 'engine' that's mostly saying you don't have an app. Of course, some successfully sell 'engines', but I think there's a basic truth that you need users to make your business work and make what you're building better and battle-hardened, and to get those users you usually have to be providing just what someone's looking for, and that often means making an app.Some 'frameworks' or 'engines' budded off from work on a concrete problem, e.g. Django first for a specific CMS, Rails from Basecamp, Unreal Engine from Unreal the game. Work's not as much of an 'engine' as those are, but it's definitely turned out a big focus is on how customers can build their own stuff (both in the frontend and the data side) and integration. But for anyone to care about all that it has to be an app first!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was previously phrased in startup advice as "start with a single vertical and generalize afterwards", "don't try to boil the ocean", etc. A lot of less-experienced entrepreneurs start with wanting to conquer all markets with their new paradigm, but the truth is you first need to capture specific segments/verticals or you'll be spread too thin.Similarly, with a software solution, you need to make it integrate into an existing stack used in the market, or else build the layers to make it something that can fit neatly into a business's processes. E.g. if there's already an established market for engines or frameworks, then a business can use your conforming engine almost plug-and-play. Otherwise you have to build the app and UI layers on top to make it end-user-facing.Once you've achieved some success in a vertical or layer (e.g. appointment bookings for salons), you can abstract the core solution/framework and start applying it to other verticals or build adapter layers to start attacking other layers (e.g. appointment bookings for everything).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42542280</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of commercial spyware targeting iOS devices, highlighting how tools like Pegasus and Predator have developed over time to exploit vulnerabilities in Apple's operating system. It examines the implications of these spyware technologies for privacy and security, detailing the techniques used by developers and the impact on users. The piece emphasizes the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures and awareness regarding the threats posed by such surveillance tools in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good overview of the public commercial spyware landscape on iOS over the years, including attributions to several of the high profile players in this space. Unfortunately, the rest of the talk is a little depressing. You'll note that I have been using words like "public" and "high profile". Despite these cases coming to light, the actual market is far broader than what was discussed here. Some of the exploits presented were not able to be conclusively tied to a specific entity or operator. Many attacks go entirely undetected.The efforts in this space by defensive organizations are laudable, but very, very immature. There's this meme that has crossed over into the software space of the planes the come back with a lot of holes in them, indicating the regions where extra armor plating is actually the least important. The commercial spyware industry is a lot like that. Those stories you see of people finding exploits via crash logs and iOS databases? That's the lowest hanging fruit. People who know what they are doing are not leaving traces there. And pretty soon those who don't will stop dropping things there too. It's really, really important to understand that the detections well that these people are sipping from will dry up very soon. The proposed solutions from the talk are not nearly enough to help. Some of the things they're asking for (process lists, for example) are already exposed, but we're currently in the Stone Age of iPhone forensics on the defensive side. Those on offense, who are incentivized by money but also now by necessity, will far outstrip any attempts to catch them after-the-fact :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People really underestimate the damage these tools are doing to society.Who can afford these tools? What lengths have people gone to earn/keep large sums of money? What problems are society going through right now?Its just stealing your data, which doesn't seem bad. But now, someone who probably doesn't like you has your location, habits, friends, future events. There are so many things that these people can do to interrupt the lives of journalists, activists, and just regular people with stalkers, and all of those things are covert because "How is your ex-girlfriend's friend supposed to know you made a bumble profile 2 days ago, find it, and match with you?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just finished reading pegasus today. Fascinating how this will keep evolving, keep getting worse and we might as well act as if we are getting surveilled. Too much incentive to not have adversarial actors.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;very similar in spirit to Olimex Neo6502
https://olimex.wordpress.com/2024/06/25/the-world-fastest-65...it's a real 6502 assisted by a RP2040https://github.com/OLIMEX/Neo6502docs http://www.neo6502.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this project!  The PCB looks clean, and has a lean, but complete set of components.160x200 video is a mistake however.  Those pixels are twice as wide as they are tall, in NTSC signaling to be perfectly fair.  And to be a bit more fair, using that resolution can mean eliminating color "dot crawl" common to devices outputting a composite color video signal, which this little computer appears to do.Now I have written quite a bit of video related code for the Propeller 1 chip featured in this project.  It is possible to compromise and double the video resolution to 320x200 and still maintain that crisp look seen in the product photos.The secret is to avoid the color signal interlacing, and or output s-video, which is separated Luma and chroma signals similar to the C64 output signal.  Additionally, one can get these little S-video to composite adapters that work pretty well on a non s-video capable display, though the Propeller can offer either video signal just for the asking, and the same video circuit is used for both.With NTSC, anything over 160 pixels in the active video area, which is the signal inside the borders seen in the product photos on the project page, tends to leave fringing between high contrast pixels.  Contrast being say, red and blue, which are far apart on the color wheel.  This is caused by the low resolution of the NTSC color signal itself being superimposed onto the monochrome Luma signal in the composite, single RCA jack output case.What I did for my video drivers, which can be found on the Parallax site with usually an MIT license, was to simply not interlace the color signal.  The spec calls for the color timing to be such that every other scan line is out of phase relative to the prior scan line.  This allows for 320 pixel color resolution with the cost being the fringing at high contrast pixel transitions.If the driver simply does not do that, the result is a bit less sharp color, but also no shimmering in the text.  That works pretty well with composite on most displays.And when S-video is used, doing the interlace simply improves on the non interlaced color, making it sharper.A propeller chip video generation is almost entirely software driven, which means one can do just about anything with the output signal.  It is really a fun device.In my opinion, a 40x25 text display with 7 bits per character, rather than the 4 bits seen on the CODY, would be a whole lot easier to read.The good news is anyone can do that due to how the Propeller is a  software driven video device.All that said, the project author may have intended a specific look and feel, and if that is the case, the project looks like a home run!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In terms of the nostalgia factor, I could smell my brand new Commodore 64 when looking at this, so from that point of view it's a win.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42544336</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of pipelining in computer architecture, explaining how it allows for the execution of multiple instruction phases simultaneously to improve overall throughput. It outlines the stages of instruction processing, including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back, while emphasizing the benefits of increased efficiency and reduced latency. The piece also touches on potential hazards, such as data and control hazards, and strategies for mitigating these challenges to optimize performance in pipelined systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research has identified a completely new class of microorganisms, named "obelisks," within the human digestive system. These previously unknown organisms exhibit unique characteristics that differentiate them from known forms of life. The discovery was made through advanced genetic sequencing techniques, revealing the potential for obelisks to play significant roles in digestion and overall gut health. This finding opens new avenues for understanding the complexities of the human microbiome and its impact on health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

AMA.This is now a peer-reviewed paper, published last month in Cell [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01091-2].Obelisks are part of a larger research program we're developing at the University of Toronto + collaborators, see also: Virus-Viroid Hybrids paper [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38301-2] and the Zeta-Elements [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04332-2].Computational biology is driving a revolutionary expansion of our understanding of Earth's biodiversity. I believe Zeta-elements, Ambiviruses, and Obelisks are just the beginning. If you're interested, our "Laboratory for RNA-Based Lifeforms" (University of Toronto) is hiring passionate developers/post-docs/graduate students [https://www.rnalab.ca].Edit: OK going to call it for now.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way this works is awesome. If I understand correctly, it's like that, given (part of) a sentence, the next token really in the sequence will be one predicted by the model among the top scoring ones, so most next tokens can be mapped to very low numbers (0 if the actual next token it's the best token in the LLM prediction, 1 if it is the second best, ...). This small numbers can be encoded very efficiently using trivial old techniques. And boom: done.So for instance:&gt; In my pasta I put a lot of [cheese]LLM top N tokens for "In my pasta I put a lot of" will be [0:tomato, 1:cheese, 2:oil]The real next token is "cheese" so I'll store "1".Well, this is neat, but also very computationally expensive :D So for my small ESP32 LoRa devices I used this: https://github.com/antirez/smaz2
And so forth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a paper explaining it in more detail? I also saw on his website he has a similar algorithm for audio compression...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The download is 153MB, compressed... didn't even bother to wait for it to finish once I saw the size.The brotli comparison is IMHO slightly misleading. Yes, it "embeds a dictionary to optimize the compression of small messages", but that dictionary is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the embedded "dictionary" which is the LLM in ts_sms.There's a reason the Hutter Prize (and the demoscene) counts the whole data necessary to reproduce its output.  In other words, ts_sms took around 18 bytes + ~152MB while brotli took around 70 bytes + ~128KB (approximately size of its dictionary and decompressor.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517035</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can make things a bit harder by locking the boot order in bios and password protecting the bios settings.Not sure how much this helps against a determined attacker, but it's easy and inconvenience is minimal in most cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you get the biggest advantage from BitLocker when you use TPM (PCR 7+11) with a PIN. That should mitigate the exploit because the FVEK should never be read without the PIN, and if BitLocker does it right (which I think it does) too many wrong PIN's results in the TPM going into dictionary attack lockout mode.Now I've been trying for months to do the same for Linux. There's systemd-cryptsetup/cryptenroll, but it's only for LUKS and I'm trying to encrypt a few sensitive directories on a super slow internal eMMC with fscrypt (keys for secure boot and /home). The TPM is _EXTREMELY_ hard to code for when things go beyond the basics:1. Bind to PCR 72. Bind to changing PCR 11 (changes whenever the kernel, init, cmdline etc. is updated)3. Use a PIN - but not the AuthValue, because I want to use the same authorization policy for resetting the DA lockout counter on login, and also have a long password/AuthValue for resetting the counter manually.4. Make it all work with PCR 11 signatures and public keys provided by systemd-stub.Maybe this isn't the right place to ask, but there's almost nothing but basic TPM guides out there, so if you're an expert I could really use your help. It's just for a personal project, but I'll write about it once I'm done - if I ever figure it out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamentally I don't understand BitLocker's security model.  In most installs it seems like you power on the machine by pressing the power button and it boots into Windows.So if someone steals you machine with an encrypted hard drive they need to...just turn it on?  That can't be right, but at the same time I have no idea how this particular attack is defeated.  I have to assume the traffic over the SPI bus is encrypted so the key can't just be dumped like that, but it seems like the machine is going to give up the key pretty easily regardless.With LUKS it at least has a password prompt to unlock the drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42552227</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;Nikon has introduced an innovative lens designed to capture both wide-angle and telephoto images simultaneously, enhancing the versatility of photography. This dual-functionality lens allows users to switch seamlessly between different focal lengths, making it ideal for various shooting scenarios. The article highlights the lens's specifications, potential uses for photographers, and how it stands out in the competitive camera accessory market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure what the policies are on banning sites, but can this website please be banned?I'm on mobile, this website has deceptive hitboxes so "dismiss" on the notifications prompt will almost hit the advert on the bottom. Once I finally managed to read the article and hit the bottom of the page, it had a popup which hijacked navigation so I couldn't easily return to HN.Will record this behavior if asked.That said... There's not much to say about this? Is it using "meta" lenses printed on silicon? Wish the article would have had any information whatsoever. I suppose we'll learn more at CES. :P&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite a number of what look like copy paste articles, I see no actual pictures of what the pictures taken look like. Maybe we'll see at CES but until then these feel like clickbait.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neither the article nor official link gave much optical design detail. Here's my guess. A (substantially) radially symmetric system comprising a wide-angle positive-short-focal-length first lens followed closely by a negative-short-focal-length whose diameter is small (thus covering a small range of angles, in the center field of view, from the first lens). A single central sensor behind the negative element is for telephoto images, while a collection of sensors distributed radially around the first lens and off axis capture wide angle images.Imagine a low-index ball lens in contact with a thin high-index negative lens. That's the idea. I'm sure the real design uses multiple surfaces/elements for each lens, and I'm sure it's hyper-optimized. I'm interested to learn how close my guess is to reality.Apologies for the complex wording to describe geometry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42515426</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the game Factorio and its unique feature called "saturation," which refers to the optimization of production chains and resource management. The author explains how players can achieve maximum efficiency by carefully balancing input and output ratios in their factories. Strategies for scaling operations and enhancing gameplay are also shared, emphasizing the importance of planning and foresight in building complex systems. The piece serves as a guide for both new and experienced players aiming to refine their factory-building skills in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SAT solvers have also been thrown at the Factorio belt weaving problem (which has in-game reasons to maximize).https://youtube.com/watch?v=2NKK_2v4jiE&amp;lc=Ugx5goGzTGz-z1g8t...Search:“ @Jodmangel

I wrote a quick script to find the longest belt weave with an SAT solver. It finds your 32-tile bridge, but also a 34-tile one:The circles are the "external" belts and the squares the 34 "internal" ones. No longer solutions exist (unless I messed up the script, obviously).”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a cool article! And it lead me down the path to another cool factorio compsci paper called 'The steady-states of splitter networks' where they really go into the theoretical properties of the belts and splitters.But I can't help to feel that the following paragraph should be removed, since it really seems to be a bit  confused about the concepts of both Np-complete and NP-hard.&gt; Finding a feasible solution is NP-hard because we can't do any better than start placing the components on a 2D grid and check if the properties are respected. Furthermore, finding the optimal solution (i.e., minimum number of components) is NP-complete because it will require enumerating all the possible solutions in order to find the best one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I started building a solver for satisfactory for someone.  Code is on GitHub if you are bored. It can do similar things, as well as finding optimal recipes and such (like some websites do) but I did it to speed up their app where their current solving of graphical models can be quite slow (20 minutes to solve a model)
I've tried a lot of approaches as a result, including going down the same paths.The balancer issue is different in particular but in my experience, for this kind of problem, using z3 and cvc5 give much faster result than mnilp solvers or cp-sat. On smaller models they are all quite fast. But as it gets larger it's actually much faster for me to binary search an optimal objective through sat with z3 or cvc5 than it is to ask most nlp solvers to optimize it.  I haven't tried gurobi or cplex of course.But I expect this is because of their ability to do really effective incremental solving so that binary searching the objective is very efficient (z3 has an optimizer and soft constraints but they do not advertise it as supporting non linear logic and I can get it to hang on some models)Especially for this type of problem, I would consider using an SMT solver and seeing how it doesIf you stick with Clos networks, a homegrown solver using bdds is probably quite fast and wildly memory efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524130</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of a fast and efficient algorithm for compressing data, known as TSZ, which achieves higher compression rates compared to traditional methods like gzip and bzip2. It emphasizes the algorithm's speed and effectiveness in handling large files while maintaining high compression performance. The author provides details about the algorithm's design, its implementation in C, and various benchmarks comparing its performance with other compression tools. Additionally, there are links to download the software and source code, along with instructions for usage.&lt;/p&gt;

It's ~3 orders of magnitude slower though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I read this correctly, the largest test reported on this page is the "enwik9" dataset, which compresses to 213 MB with xz and only 135 MB with this method, a 78 MB difference... using a model that is 340 MB (and was probably trained on the test data).No one would be impressed with saving 78 MB on compression using a 340 MB dictionary so I am not sure why this is good?Please let me know if I misunderstand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549083</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and limitations of passkey technology, which is designed to enhance online security by replacing traditional passwords with cryptographic keys stored on devices. While passkeys offer a more secure and user-friendly alternative, the author highlights issues such as compatibility with various devices and services, the complexity of implementation, and user experience hurdles that hinder widespread adoption. Ultimately, while passkeys present an elegant solution for improving security, their usability issues may prevent them from becoming a mainstream security mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In some parallel universe, each computing device manufacturer is required by law to provide a storage so that the user can plug in their single, universal, transferrable set of security credentials (like passkeys). Instead of "many cooks" mentioned in the article, there is one standard.I cannot bring myself to agree to any "switch to passkey" prompt from any device because I have no idea (and too tired to figure out) how and where that key will be stored, how do I deal with different devices, etc. I already have a universal solution for credentials: 1password, which is cross-platform. With Apple's keychain, and I suspect other companies' solutions, passkeys are connected to your account and at best synced between devices from the same manufacturer. But even with Apple, I can't sync stuff between my personal and work computer because they use different Apple IDs, even though the underlying true identity (me) is the same.Like with many other solutions, the current approach with passkeys is designed for an imaginary "user in vacuum" model each company dreams about, where people are 100% into one ecosystem, forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article author skirts around the key true observation here, which is that passkeys were a great idea until cloud vendors waged war on hardware keys.The concept of a passkey as desired by Yubico was that every user buys a set of hardware keys, uses those instead of passwords, and has no ability to authenticate otherwise.The concept of a passkey as desired by Apple, Google, and Microsoft is that every user magically authenticates using their OS, and has no ability to authenticate otherwise.The reason the UX is confusing is because the OS vendors don't want the users using non-OS software or hardware - they want you to use a cloud-hosted passkey instead of using a Discoverable Credential on a Hardware Authenticator, and instead of using a password manager providing its own sync facility. This is shown in the screenshots in the article.The ideal future state is:* the provider for newly registered credentials would be a browser setting* the setting would come configured to use the OS vendor out of the box* installing a password manager providing passkeys would prompt to change the setting to use the password manager instead* one of the options in this setting would be "prompt me every time". Approximately nobody would choose that option* there would never be a prompt for what to use on authenticate() calls, only register(). Authenticate would use whichever valid credential you provided first, whether that's plugging in a token or scanning your thumb to unlock a TPM or whateverIn this world, 99% of people are using OS-vendor-provided cloud-synced passkeys, but technical users get what they want too and everybody has both a secure and an easy experience.The thing stopping us from getting to that ideal state is that the provider of the FIDO "platform" (the software that lets you choose a key to use) is the OS vendor instead of the browser vendor, and they have a conflict of interest because the OS vendors are also cloud services vendors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TOTP suffers from a similar issue - I use 1Password to store my TOTP codes, but both Google and the UK's HMRC tax website talk about using their own apps for codes rather than  anything agreed like "one-time passwords". The digital world is rife with this kind of jockeying for position through language. It took me far too long to understand that "podcasts" are just mp3 files from an RSS feed.Likewise, in the heyday of interactive TV in the early 2000s, when it was going to conquer the world because everyone had a TV but not a computer, an agency I worked for were invited for a demonstration of a choose-your-own-adventure game they were developing. They kept referencing a "carousel system" where all pages were sent in a looping system and when someone made a choice it waited until that page came round in the "carousel". I kept asking whether that was like Teletext - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext - but they absolutely refused to say that and kept saying "well, it's a carousel system".This refusal to deal in everyday language, alongside trying to get people to use their own apps / sytems, really hinders the adoption of useful technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548719</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just tried this with an interpersonal situation I'm going through. The default seems to be Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT-4o. I got the results I've come to expect from those two, with the latter better at non-programming kinds of prompts.The app presented the option of prompting additional models, including Gemini Flash 2.0, one I'd never used before. It gave the best response and was surprisingly good.Curious to know how Chorus is paying for the compute, as I was expecting to have to use my own API keys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! One of the creators of Chorus here. Really cool to hear how everyone is using it. We made this as an experiment because it felt silly to constantly be switching between the ChatGPT, Claude, and LMStudio desktop app. It's also nice to be able to run models with custom system prompts in one place (I have Claude with a summary of how CBT works that I find pretty helpful).It's a Tauri 2.0 desktop app (not Electron!), so it is using the Mac's native browser view and a Rust backend. It also makes DMG size relatively small (~25mb but we can get it much smaller once we get rid of some bloat).Right now Chorus is proxying API calls to our server, so it's free to use. We didn't add bring-your-own-api key to this version because it was a bit quicker to ship. This was kind of an experimental winter break project, so didn't think too hard about it. Likely will have to fix that (and add bring your own key? or a paid version?) as more of you use it :)Definitely planning on adding support for local models too. Happy to answer any other questions, and any feedback is super helpful (and motivating!) for us.UPDATE: Just added the option to bring your own API keys! It should be rolling out over the next hour or so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airtrain.ai and  msty.app have had this for a while.What isn't there and would be useful is to not have them side by side but rather swipable. When you're using for code comparisons even 2 gets stuffy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42543601</guid></item><item><title>18.

It discusses SQLite's simplicity, portability, and self-contained nature, making it ideal for embedded systems and applications requiring a lightweight database.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; SQLite is not open source in the legal sense, as “open source” has a specific definition and requires licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).This is wrong, and harmfully wrong. OSI are not the arbiters of open source. Their Open Source Definition, though generally useful and accepted, is not without legitimate criticism and controversy. As for their approval, that’s a dreadful thing to rely on for any purpose; &lt;https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/05/05/Rely-on-OSI.html&gt; is a good description of most of what’s wrong with it (it doesn’t really get into the broken politics enough; but some of his other articles contain more), and I like its summary: “The list of OSI-approved licenses reflects OSI’s practical and political history, not any useful, consistently functional category of license terms.”As for whether SQLite is open source, well, the only reason a public domain dedication doesn’t meet the OSD is that it’s not a license. It’s more open. In a way that is legally mildly uncertain in some jurisdictions, sure, but to call it “not open source in the legal sense” is just wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This blog feels like karma farming. Recycled, old points in listicle format on a popular topic with questionable accuracy. 
This is on top of mixing in grievances the author's startup holds against Dr Richard Hipp, like "won't accept (our) outside contributions" and "not actually open source according to OSI".As far as content goes, this listicle is probably great for view counts/engagement/flamewars. I'd personally prefer deeper thinking which this blog's previous posts-- high in hype and low in technical rigor-- have not yet provided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; SQLite does not have a Code of Conduct (CoC), rather Code of EthicsThere was confusion over this, because of different usage of words. Simplifying well beyond the point of strict accuracy, a CoC is a weapon to bind and control external contributors’ behaviour, the CoE is SQLite developers declaring their intended conduct towards others.&gt; SQLite is pronounced as “Ess-Cue-El-Lite”.This doesn’t match the quote that follows, which says “S-Q-L-ite, like a mineral”. And that’s just how one guy chooses to pronounce it… I wonder how many others do; certainly I’ve never heard it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549807</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found the reddit thread referenced in the video and left comments -On the original ethernet being a mistake -"I have another perspective on this - the bus concept at its roots dates to 1974/75 - a machine that could function as a hub in 1975 or even in 1979 would have potentially been as large and costly as the mini-computers Ethernet was intended to interconnect. A switch at that time would have been extraordinary costly.Bus was the right technology for the time (as in the right one to go to market), it was right because it was an easy low cost means to get the LAN concept into more peoples hands so they could see the utility of it.What I did find surprising was Metcalfe's resistance to UTP based standards with a hub in the middle once the technology did catch up - my gut from here 40 years on - makes me think that he was concerned about protecting his investments in 10base5 and 10base2, and making sure his installed base didnt feel like they had an obsolete product - as well as protecting 3Com's position as a 'Market Leader' in the space.As an aside, I remember working on 10Base2 networks well into the late 90's and early 2000's - it was widely used in certain situations - like computer labs - where the bus topology made installation significantly easier than home runs would have been."On 8P8C being picked as the connector -"Also as someone who has spent a portion of my career doing cabling, thank you for picking the 8P8C modular system, its significantly better - both in cost and ease of assembly than anything I'm aware of existing at that time.While there are some electrical issues with the 8P8C, the connector has been flexible enough that with minor design changes to keep up as line speeds have increased.As a note, there are several vendors that make push-thru modular connectors (as in the wire extends beyond the front of the connector shell and the crimper trims it, much like how the cut blade on a punch tool works), which completely eliminate the need to accurately trim and face the wire ends - a huge time/frustration savings."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My history with networking:- late 70s, rs232 terminals. well, it kind of worked. i spent a lot of time under the desk- early 80s, frozen hose ethernet - i remember not being able to get a sun workstation to sit on the desk because the cable lifted it off too much- late 80s coax ethernet all sorts of termination  and other problems- 90s twisted pair and hubs - things started working as they should.- a bit later cheap switches came along, but still lots of wires at the desk- now, wireless bliss.- don't talk to me about token ring.But of course I don't do this stuff any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Serial Port is a very good channel. Been learning a lot with their last videos, almost feels like we're traveling in time :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42513290</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hardy's "A course of Pure Mathematics" has been highly regarded since it was first published in 1908 because it was an innovative text: rigorous, modern, well-written. Its intended readership was always first year "honours" mathematics students. This book inspired innovation in subsequent generations of textbook writers.However, in the 21st century, this book really can no longer be recommended for its original teaching purpose.  As a textbook it is outdated (a term I hate, but it is true).  It is now an historical curiosity - although one which I am pleased to own, and the exercises in the book are still worth a look.Calculus  teaching has progressed considerably since 1908.  The construction of the real number system in Hardy's book, using the Dedekind Cut method is overly complicated - the use of the of Least Upper Bound is much simpler and clearer.  Hardy defines the concept of integral solely as the anti-derivative; there is no discussion of Riemann sums, or Darboux sums, etc. I am sure I would not want to take Hardy's approach today.I think we are better off recommending books are more modern.I will start by recommending "Calculus" by Michael Spivak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this book as a first-year undergrad. His style inspired me to go after rigour and proof and was a good start to serious mathematics. I always loved Hardy's work and Hardy and Wright's number theory text was also very nice through my PhD in algebra/number theory. I found Hardy's book much nicer than the contemporary calculus texts with irrelevant pictures and modern-day examples. Just straight math! Not for everyone, but it has classical, austere appeal for those who enjoy such things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be more useful to link to the Gutenberg page that shows links to the various formats:https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38769&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42553682</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a presentation from the 36th Chaos Communications Congress (36C3) that explores the inner workings of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and its security vulnerabilities. It examines the architecture and functionalities of RF microcontrollers, emphasizing the challenges of analyzing proprietary firmware. The speaker demonstrates techniques for reverse engineering BLE applications and highlights the importance of understanding the security implications of these technologies. The goal is to shed light on the often opaque nature of RF microcontrollers, encouraging better security practices and awareness in IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;

- Analog Devices (ADF7xxx)
- SiLabs (Si4xxxx)
- Semtech (SX1xxx)
- Texas Instruments (CCxxxx)If i remember correctly the Analog Devices and the Semtech radios share the same internal core (blackfin?). Please correct me if i am wrong. For the Semtech and ADF702x there are firmware patches and/or ROMs available.
The most interesting part would be to unlock the internal test mode which some of those chips have…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's unfortunate that there's no analog (I/Q) transmission built into the TI chips. They could make fairly useful SDR transceivers otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some microcontrollers have much better documented rf subsystems. Onsemi has a well documented RSL15 radio. Nordic has docs and there's an open source ble implementation from apache too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549184</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This rings true to my ears:&gt; There is no technical moat in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter of an investment bubble. Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors mistakenly thought investing in Netscape was a way to bet on the future of the open internet and the World Wide Web in particular.OpenAI has a short-ish window of opportunity to figure out how to build a moat."Trying to spend more" is not a moat, because the largest US and Chinese tech companies can always outspend OpenAI.The clock is ticking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unimaginable Sums of Money Are All You NeedThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Huge Sums of Money in the Natural SciencesUnimaginable Sums of Money Considered Harmful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenAI's engineers: brilliant, A+, A* even.OpenAI's C-suite: Well, they earned the C, but it was a letter grade.What a profoundly unimaginative strategy. No matter the industry, a large-scale diversion of resources towards a moonshot goal will likely get you to that goal. They haven't made an argument as to why we should do that just for them, especially with all of the other alternatives.And no, advertising your previously secret testing models (e.g. o3) as if they were market competitors is not how to prove they should have our money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42544367</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;A YouTuber successfully defended against a DMCA takedown notice issued by an individual pretending to be a Nintendo lawyer. The YouTuber identified the spoofed email address and proved that the DMCA notice was fraudulent, leading to the reinstatement of their content. This incident highlights the potential for abuse in the DMCA process and emphasizes the importance of verifying the authenticity of claims made under the law. The case illustrates how creators can take proactive steps to protect their work from false claims.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; According to YouTube, about 6 percent of removals from July to December 2023 were abusive, along with 10 times more attempted abusive removalsI uploaded the recording of my father's funeral to youtube, to share as an unlisted video. It attracted two copyright claims - for hymns written in the 18th century.These were claims - not takedown requests - but I didn't think it was appropriate to share a link to the family that was unable to attend in person that would serve them ads. So I instead made the video private and shared it a different way.But if I don't contest the claims, how can youtube possibly count them as abusive?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still bugs me that this Australian skateboarding video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nod5q7OHAF4 has a note of "music from Youth Group song Forever Young"There is not a single note of that song in the video.  The opposite in fact, the video was used for the song.  With no attribution.The video/film is from the Australian ABC afternoon show GTK, which way predates the song.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me it seems he didn’t win, he just lived to fight another day. Winning would be if YouTube would treat him as if or better than if this never happened, or if the guy got in trouble, or if it would be harder to do this in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42550501</guid></item><item><title>26.

I watch it from time to time and see new things each time.I don't remember where I read the story, but it might have been in the DVD extras.  Henry Fonda grew a goatee and dyed his hair black before he flew to Spain for the start of filming.  When he got there and Leone saw him he screamed "nooooo" because he hired Fonda to be the baby-faced assassin.Also, aside from the visuals, the music in this film is probably the best match between music and video ever.  Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is pure genius.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scene discussed:https://youtu.be/QML28YQBvycAnd the excellent scene that follows (after the train stops without any passengers departing, or so the gang thinks):https://youtu.be/uhYLfK8GSr0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always took that opening scene as establishing how tough and capable the 3 waiting gunmen are.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;1925 was late to be predicting the escalator. Macy's in New York not only had escalators by then, they're still there and functioning. The first escalator dates back to the late 19th century. Moving sidewalks first appeared at the Paris Exposition in 1900, and that was probably the best implementation of the concept.This article seems to be an ad for some genealogy service, picked up and copied into the Guardian as filler. It's a low point for a once renowned newspaper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of these things seem hardly out there in the context of when he made them.Well working on r&amp;d for a television he predicted people would use TV for news? Like if you already invented a tv, that seems like the most obvious use.During the high point of first wave feminism and changing gender roles, he predicted that woman wearing pants might become the norm...He predicted wind power despite wind power having been used for hundreds of years by this point.He predicted "Life is to be made far easier by the use of machinery that will do all the heavy and disagreeable work.” in the middle of that already starting to happen (the industrial revolution was already well over at this point)To be sure, its easy to look back and think things are obvious. Plenty of people of that time would have said the opposite. However its not like these predictions were out of left field for the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honestly, I think it's downright dishonest to talk about someone's predictions for what the future would look like and never actually show what their predictions were. This case is particularly annoying, because it's a newspaper summarizing a blog post that's summarizing the original predictions, so there's no actual direct quotations in the article linked here. Although even the originating blog post carries minimal quotations, with such that it does have so thoroughly trimmed that it's hard to actually ascertain what the predictions were in the first place.Although in one case--the claim of predicting the escalator--the original quotation is not so thoroughly clipped to prevent the assignment of the escalator to the prediction is laughably false:&gt; [...] lift to the door of his office! If he has to go anywhere on foot moving sidewalks will save him exertion. In his office there will be good automatic telephones, which will get the right number every time! If in [...]Even the brevity of the clip seems clear that the idea is that moving sidewalks would be the norm in cities as a form of public transport, as opposed to the situation today where moving sidewalks are largely limited to airports and complex train stations, where gates may be some distance. The closest equivalent I can think of is Hong Kong's use of the escalator in a few streets as public transport. Given that moving sidewalks were debuted at least 30 years before the prediction, it should be obvious that the prediction wasn't their existence but their ubiquity.In general, a lot of these "old futurists correctly predicted the modern world!" types of articles tend to rely very heavily on misinterpreting the predictions to be able to grade them correct, which is why I'm frustrated when the articles don't even bother to source the predictions in their entirety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42545875</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos to their founders and team for trying to disrupt this space.https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/brave-carehttps://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2021/10/07/brave-c... | https://archive.today/Qd8fQhttps://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/yc-backed-brave-care-raise...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have heard conflicting accounts of inefficiencies in the US healthcare system.One account is that the US has too many medical facilities in urban areas. In other words, there might be five hospitals each with its own radiology equipment. That equipment is idle some of the time, so you could close some of the imaging departments and leave just one or two for the metro area. That would obviously inconvenience some people, but the gist of the criticism is that the US duplicates medical capacity for the sake of convenience.The other criticism is that there are too few clinics and such. That's why there was a big push to open health clinics in pharmacies and urgent care locations recently.Now I know these aren't mutually exclusive; you can have too few clinics and too many hospitals. But I would like to know if anyone is more informed than I am what validity there is to each criticism.I'm curious what the truth is regarding the number and character of brick-and-mortar healthcare facilities in the US: too many? too few? Because it looks like this company was opening physical clinics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP here.I visited their clinics for my daughter several times when she was a toddler for ear aches and other ailments— I found the experience refreshing: instant online booking, no BS registration and online communication with staff was seamless. Very sad to see them go so abruptly.Up until this morning when I was told they were gone, I had no idea they were YC or otherwise VC funded. Just came here to pour one out for a genuinely helpful and pleasant medical company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42543431</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some haunting episodes of "The Twilight Zone".I remember seeing the episode "Walking Distance" for the first time as a Freshman just in college. I was away from home, away from all my friends. I was coming to realize, with a kind of horror, that the door behind me, my childhood, had truly shut. I wasn't sure at all that I would like this new adult world.Gathered in the "commons" room of the dorm, watching that "Twilight Zone" episode, I just sat in the back of the dark room and cried. But his final message, that there are merry-go-rounds in the adult world if you know to look for them stuck with me.Also blown away when I saw the episode, "The Lonely". If you know the episode, you know how it ends."All you're leaving behind Corry, is loneliness.""I must remember to keep that in mind."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember watching Examination Day  (later Twilight Zone from the 80s) when I was a kid when my parents were away (I wasn't allowed to watch the twilight zone) and I couldn't sleep well for quite a while after that but could not tell my parents why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best story I have about Rod Serling is that my dad (who went to Cornell) knew him during his time as a teacher at Ithaca College, and ended up briefly dating his daughter! A very amiable person, who you'd never guess had such a chambered mind, at least from all the stories I hear.Try looking ahead: https://youtu.be/tDtT7CEQcMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42519875</guid></item><item><title>33. 86Box: Emulator of x86-Based Machines</title><link>https://github.com/86Box/86Box</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of overloading lambda functions in programming, specifically focusing on how to implement and manage different behaviors of lambda expressions based on their context and parameters. It emphasizes practical examples and provides insights into the benefits and challenges of using overloaded lambda functions to enhance code readability and functionality. The author also explores potential pitfalls and offers guidance on best practices for handling lambda overloading effectively in various programming scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fun thing is that this sounds like "just" a more type-safe version of the way DSLs are usually implemented in imperative languages, particularly scripting languages.In Python, if I have:    def foo(x):
        return x**2 - 1

I can plug in a concrete argument:    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo(2)
    3

But I can also plug in abstract values provided by some library where all operators are overloaded to return another AST node.  For instance:    &gt;&gt;&gt; from z3 import *
    &gt;&gt;&gt; expr = foo(Int('x'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; expr
    x**2 - 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(expr)
    &lt;class 'z3.z3.ArithRef'&gt;

And then I can perform abstract operations on the resulting AST node, like solving for x:    &gt;&gt;&gt; solve(expr == 0)
    [x = -1]

Of course this is completely non-type-safe.  And without purity, there's no guarantee that `foo(Int('x'))` is truly equivalent to running foo on an abstract value `x`.  If there's an `if` statement in there, the condition will either pass or not, and the returned AST node will only include that control flow path.  The DSL in question tries to block that by preventing AST nodes from being converted to boolean, but it's not perfect.  Haskell has an advantage there.On the other hand, for the situation at the end of the post, where the author wants to model imperative computations, it seems like an imperative language would make for easier embedding.  In an imperative language, each AST node can be given its own unique ID when it's constructed.  So there's no trouble distinguishing between, e.g., calling some function bar() and then using the return value twice, versus calling bar() twice.  No need to use a separate &lt;- operator for assignments.But to be fair, explicitly distinguishing side effects is kind of the whole point of Haskell!(And if you wanted badly enough to do it in Haskell without requiring &lt;-, you could use unsafePerformIO to assign AST node IDs.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linear functions/SMC work is really cool, but I am surprised to see the author calling it more mature than the compiling to CCCs work. The linear-smc library hasn't had an upload in a while, and it's currently missing any haddocks beyond the extracted type signatures. It's also a shame that it had to build its own typeclass for monoidal categories instead of using the one in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/categories .Meanwhile KittyHawk did actually use the compile-to-CCCs work to compile Haskell to C in https://github.com/sellout/compiling-anything-to-categories and someone from there talks about it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUBj8NW7uMAI think the linear-smc work is more exciting and I hope it matures with a bit more elbow grease. There was an ICFP talk that accompanied the linked paper ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90OJz0QE4qE ) and monoidal categories can model lots of "boxes and wires" things. Linear functions potentially give you a much more ergonomic DSL for building up those boxes-and-wires models, and in a way that lets you write abstractions that work over any model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a delightful blog post.  One need not fully understand all the prologue bits to understand the interface and implementation produced.This technique could be very useful in developing other DSLs on Haskell.  Basically the author found a simple monadic-looking mapping of Haskell functions onto a different Category where you can do interesting things with those functions.  In TFA's case the idea is to write flow diagrams where "boxes" embed [user-provided] Haskell functions, then the machinery can do whatever might be expected for diagrams, like: render visual representations of them, evaluate them, analyze them, etc.  Because the boxes embed Haskell functions the flow diagrams can do useful work, so they're more than just documentation, they can be code and documentation.  Basically this is a flow diagram programming language as a DSL embedded in Haskell.Imagine using this technique to build things like networking stacks, say.  Or emulators of various sorts (CPUs/ISAs, say).  Or maybe one could use this to make something like a PLC in Haskell.  It's really quite a neat and powerful idea, especially if it really does compile to efficient code.What else might one use this for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530844</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of selective testing in software development, highlighting its role in improving efficiency and effectiveness. It outlines various strategies for implementing selective testing, such as prioritizing tests based on risk assessments and focusing on specific areas of code that have been modified. The piece emphasizes the need for a balance between comprehensive testing and resource management, suggesting that selective testing can lead to faster feedback loops and higher quality software. Ultimately, the article aims to inform developers about best practices in selective testing to enhance their development processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The better you can describe the interdependencies between the components, the more chances the selective approaches have.However, often if you knew about a given dependency, you might have avoided bugs in the first place!A simple scenario to illustrate what I have in mind: a system with two plugins, A and B. They provide completely independent functionality, and are otherwise entirely unrelated.Plugin A adds a new function which allocates a large amount of memory. All tests for A pass. All tests for B pass. The tests for B when A is loaded fail.Turns out A has done two things:1) the new memory allocation together with the existing memory allocations in B causes an OOM when both are used.2) the new function addition offset the function table in the main program, and the plugin B was relying on a haedcoded function index, which didn’t change, by sheer chance, for years.Those are the the tales based on the real world experience, which made me abandon the idea for the project I am working on (VPP) - the trade offs didn’t seem to be worth it. For some other scenario they may be different though, so thanks for looking into this issue!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nix solves this as a byproduct (as it does with many things) of its design. You can have your tests be a "build", where the build succeeds if your tests pass. Any builds can be cached, which means you're essentially caching tests you've already run. Since Nix is deterministic, you never have to rerun any tests until anything about them that could change the evaluation changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like others, I think this is a solution describing an idealised problem but it very quickly breaks down.Firstly, if we could accurately know the dependencies that potentially affected a top-level test, we are not like to have a problem in the first place. Our code base is not particularly complex and is probably around 15 libraries and a web app + api in a single solution. A change to something in a library potentially affects about 50 places (but might not affect any of these) and most of the time there is no direct/easy visibility of what calls what to call what to call what. There is also no correlation between folders and top-level tests. Most code is shared, how would that work?Secondly, we use some front-end code (like many on HN), where a simple change could break every single other front-end page. Might be bad architecture but that is what it is and so any front-end change would need to run every UI change. The breaks might be subtle like a specific button now disappears behind a sidebar. Not noticeable on the other pages but will definitely break a test.Thirdly, you have to run all of your tests before deploying to production anyway so the fact you might get some fast feedback early on is nice but most likely you won't notice the bad stuff until the 45 minutes test suite has run at which point, you have blocked production and will have to prove that you have fixed it before waiting another 45 minutes.Fourthly, a big problem for us (maybe 50% of the failures) are flaky tests (maybe caused by flaky code, timing issues, database state issue or just hardware problems) and running selective tests doesn't deal with this.And lastly, we already run tests somewhat selectively - we run unit tests on branch uilds before building main, we have a number of test projects in parallel but still with less than perfect Developers, less than perfect Architecture, less than perfect CI tools and environments, I think we are just left to try and incrementally improve things by identifying parallelisation opportunities, not over-testing functionality that is not on the main paths etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517163</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;Belgium has announced plans to ban the sales of disposable e-cigarettes in an effort to curb youth vaping and promote public health. This decision is part of a broader initiative to regulate tobacco and related products more strictly. The ban reflects growing concerns over the rising popularity of vaping among young people and the potential health risks associated with disposable e-cigarettes. The new regulations aim to create a safer environment for younger populations and encourage healthier lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a big week at work coming up and I can’t afford the dip in energy level and productivity that comes with withdrawal. I’ll buy one more just this once and then I’ll quit for sure.Amazing the hoops my mind jumps through for an addictive molecule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a lot of people outside Europe will see this as overreach by the state, but given waste cleanup is paid for by the tax payer and is an ever increasing cost/problem, banning products needlessly adding to rubbish when inexpensive reusable alternatives makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here in Oz the banning of disposable nicotine vapes has led to an increase in organised crime activity.Schoolkids are getting the vapes without any problems.Great idea, but poorly implemented.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;20 years ago, one of my professors pointed out during a review that "benchmark is not research." Now I see literally everywhere benchmarks with very basic conclusions. I'm not criticizing this particular work, but such publications are low-effort unless they point to something new.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I reading the example correctly? The prompt is the same size as the generated code, and likely more difficult to understand? Why would you use that? Why would you use anything that includes a "TODO"?-- ignoring what I would consider "weird" in the code, I assume that's just style.The prompt is:This function performs a forward pass for a model, incorporating conditioning and time step information.It randomly selects time steps, applies learned conditioning if applicable, and processes the inputs according to the model's conditioning 
requirements.Finally, it computes and returns the loss for the given inputs and conditioning.The ground truth (am I correct, this is the expected answer?) is:  def forward(self, x, c, *args, **kwargs):
     t = torch.randint(0, self.num_timesteps, (x.shape[0],), device=self.device).long()
     logging.info(f'Random timestep t generated with shape: {t.shape}')
     if self.model.conditioning_key is not None:
         assert c is not None
         if self.cond_stage_trainable:
             c = self.get_learned_conditioning(c)
         if self.shorten_cond_schedule: # TODO: drop this option
             tc = self.cond_ids[t].to(self.device)
             c = self.q_sample(x_start=c, t=tc, noise=torch.randn_like(c.float()))
     return self.p_losses(x, c, t, *args, **kwargs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; so there was basically no chance that models had been trained on submission code yet. I do suspect performance on AoC 24 will increase over time…No, but several of the problems were similar to problems in the training set from other challenges.There was one that was almost exactly the same as one on Google Foobar called 'Prepare the Bunnies' Escape' as an example.It is pretty hard to make these challenges that work across multiple langs, skills etc.. without making them into 'which works dfs/bfs/a*/dykstra' problems.Obviously outside of the leaderboard group, an LLM being able to solve it doesn't really matter.My friends and I flipped a coin for TDD vs traditional with each day, testing out assumptions and evaluating what was most readable/maintainable.It was great for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42551660</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordering Evolv Technologies to cease overstating the effectiveness of its gun detection technology, which the FTC characterized as essentially advanced metal detectors. The agency's action stems from concerns that the company's marketing claims mislead consumers about the technology's capabilities in preventing gun-related incidents. The FTC emphasizes the importance of accuracy in advertising for security technologies, particularly in high-stakes environments like schools and public venues, in order to ensure public safety and informed decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple concert venues in my city use these, so I interact with them all the time. They have replaced standard metal detectors, bag searches, and manual patdowns w/ hands and/or metal-detecting wands. Security checkpoints are the primary point of delay for getting into venues, and places that have rolled these out process people through about 95% faster. It's a huge difference. If it does trigger, you just get the manual patdown you would have gotten anyway, so the false positive cases aren't any lost time.The article and settlement seem to only mention the false positive rate, which is a bad thing to focus on. Every true positive is a much faster experience. Only subjecting 110 out of 3000 people to a longer search is a big improvement. Given the negative outcomes of a gun slipping through and the lack of a cost of a false positive, we probably want it to be tuned to be more false positive prone anyway. We don't need these to detect guns THAT well, we just need them to weed out people who definitely don't have them.I do have concerns about what its false negative rate is relative to the standard practice it replaces. I do not really trust whatever psuedo-AI they're bolting to their metal detectors; it's probably easier to get a gun through. That said, the false negative rate probably isn't good already. TSA isn't great on their false positive rate, does more intense screening, and isn't being staffed by hungover 20-somethings. So maybe the false negative rate didn't actually increase by much?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting how a guy whose entire administration is being investigated and indicted by the FBI ran almost entirely on a ‘law and order’ platform, with this pilot being one of the staples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cannot find any summaries for the cost of these detection devices. What did this cost, anyone know?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549857</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the escalating conflict between Apple and Meta regarding issues of interoperability and privacy in their respective ecosystems. Apple emphasizes its commitment to user privacy, standing firm against Meta’s push for more interoperability between different platforms, which Meta argues is essential for better user experiences and innovation. The piece examines how this confrontation reflects broader industry trends and the implications for consumers, developers, and the future of digital privacy and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

Their only retort is Apple’s privacy concerns are anticompetitive excuses. Two things can be true: Apple is only protecting their own interests, and Meta is a terrible would-be guardian of all the data they’re requesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta’s request for interoperability is regarding their hardware, not their flagship apps, if you take it at face value.They want their glasses and headsets to integrate as tightly as an Apple Watch or Vision Pro to show messages and other notifications, connect to WiFi, and share files with an iPhone, but Apple uses private APIs for their own devices. Meta says that is anticompetitive and the APIs should be public.Apple lays out their rebuttal in detail here and it’s clear Meta asked for everything in the hopes that Apple will settle for some of these things: https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interopera...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one of my personal issues with allowing Meta to access these private APIs is that they may not take "don't allow" for an answer.I have WhatsApp to talk to some family and I recently disabled allowing all contacts in iOS 18. WhatsApp now has a persistent notification at the top of messages to "Allow All Contacts".If Apple allows users to choose whether or not to give Meta access, and users choose "no", Meta can lock them out of the service entirely (e.g., "you can't use this Meta Quest headset without allowing access to your messages").That being said, Apple is definitely fighting for its own interests here as well. It would obviously benefit them to sell their own watches, headsets, earbuds, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548359</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the common practice of using database mocks in testing software, suggesting that they can lead to more issues than they solve. The author highlights that mocks often create a false sense of security, as they may not accurately represent real database behavior, potentially masking bugs and leading to unreliable tests. Instead, the article advocates for using real databases in testing environments, even if it requires additional setup, as this approach provides more accurate results and better reflects how the application will perform in production. The piece emphasizes the importance of maintaining test fidelity to ensure software reliability and encourages developers to rethink their testing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t code with mocks period.
Structure your code such that it has a functional core and imperative shell. All logic is unit testable (functional core). All IO and mutation Is not unit testable (imperative shell).Mocks come from a place where logic is heavily intertwined with IO. It means your code is so coupled that you can’t test logic without touching IO.IO should be a dumb layer as much as possible. It should be Extremely general and as simple as fetching and requesting in the stupidest way possible. Then everything else should be covered by unit tests while IO is fundamentally not unit testable.If you have a lot of complex sql statements or logic going on in the IO layer (for performance reasons don’t do this if you can’t help it) it means your IO layer needs to be treated like a logical layer. Make sure you have stored procedures and unit tests written in your database IO language. You code should interface only with stored procedures as IO and those stored procedures should be tested as unit tests in the IO layer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's probably worth mentioning that the principal concern for tests should be proving out the application's logic, and unless you're really leaning on your database to be, e.g., a source of type and invariant enforcement for your data, any sort of database-specific testing can be deferred to integration and UAT.I use both the mocked and real database approaches illustrated here because they ultimately focus on different things: the mocked approach validates that the model is internally consistent with itself, and the real database approach validates that the same model is externally consistent with the real world.It may seem like a duplication of effort to do that, but tests are where you really should Write Everything Twice in a world where it's expected that you Don't Repeat Yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was common knowledge and that it became even easier after Docker became a thing?Mocks are wishful thinking incarnate most of the time, though here and there they are absolutely needed (like 3rd party APIs without sandbox environments, or quite expensive API, or most of the time: both).Just pick a task runner -- I use just[0] -- and make a task that brings up both Docker and your containers, then run your test task, done. Sure it's a bit fiddly the first time around but I've seen juniors conquer that in a day maximum and then your tests actually work with the real world 99% of the time.Mocks in general are rarely worth it, the DB ones: 10x so.[0] https://github.com/casey/just&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42552976</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, good. It's a shame nobody else has stepped up to do this first. Maybe China doing it first will help get the ball rolling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woah, looks like this article has a major error in it right up front:"The project follows a 2-MW experimental version completed in 2021 and operated since then. "They completed the TMSR-LF1 back then, and got authorization to turn it on, but have never announced startup or operation, as far as I'm aware. I've actually been bracing for the headline since 2021 because it would be the first time we operated a molten salt reactor since Oak Ridge's MSRE shut down in 1969.For all its purported benefits, fluid nuclear fuel has major challenges because the extraordinarily radioactive fission products are no longer held up inside the fuel pins, but rather are flowing around the entire primary system, coming into intimate contact with (and plating out on) pumps, heat exchangers, the vessel wall, instruments, valves, etc. etc. My guess is that they ran into some trouble with containing this, or remotely maintaining the primary equipment.FWIW, the US started up a commercial thorium-fueled reactor back in 1961 at Indian Point 1 [1] (previously known as the Consolidated Edison Thorium Reactor [2]). We replaced the thorium with enriched uranium in the second core, and all subsequent cores, because it was a lot more economical.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sWqmPyoYxw[2] https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015086582338&amp;se...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commence, maybe. Given their lead in pebble bed, I wonder why? Probably competing teams and competing funding and goals. Thorium was in test decades ago in the USA and its applicability to large scale power with lower proliferation risk is given. I think the article's pointing out how much usable thorium China has as a side effect of rare earth mining may get to the heart of things: people with giant trash piles look for ways to monetise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42554008</guid></item><item><title>45.

If it truly cannot be linked because it is private, more context is still needed to understand what this data means.I actually can’t find the source myself, but I can find “Delinquency Rate on Credit Card Loans, All Commercial Banks” from the Federal Reserve. [1]The percents from that source somewhat match those referenced in the FT quote. “Peaked in July”- 2024Q1 3.15%- 2024Q2 3.24%- 2024Q3 3.23%Using 2019 as “the year before the pandemic”, the average was 2.5825. Is +0.6475 “nearly a percentage point”? I guess it technically would round up.Seemingly important context that the quote doesn’t give is that 3.23% is lower than any time 1991Q3 to 2011Q4. But, maybe the trend matters more for this metric.[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anecdotal but my spending habits changed a lot during lockdown and it's been an uphill battle to get them back to normal.There was a period there where we were flush with valuable cash that you wanted to just spend, just for the dopamine hit in some cases, but also because you knew the cash was going to be worth less over time.  Getting stimulus checks was a bit of a mindfuck too.  We still shop almost exclusively on our phones, and it's so easy to just "add to cart" and have someone put it in my trunk or drop it at my doorstep.Cut to a few years later and the cost of things has risen faster than my income and my brain is still "COVID rich", I can see why credit card balances are higher and defaults are more common.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This entire article seems to be completely based on a non-inflation adjusted write-off value. It is not surprising to me that we are setting write-off records. We were bound to at some point!It is clear that delinquencies have ticketed up over the last year or two. But this article does not do a particularly good job about contextualizing if this is actually concerning.Here is the actual rate:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CORCCT100SPretty tough to look at that and determine if this clearly concerning or an moderate adjustment to a changing post-covid environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42552222</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and limitations faced when implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) in Guile, a programming language based on Scheme. It highlights the discrepancies between traditional OOP concepts and their application within Guile, specifically addressing issues such as subclassing, method resolution, and the design of classes and instances. The author provides insights into how Guile's structure and paradigms may complicate OOP practices, and suggests potential solutions and workarounds to improve OOP implementation in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strange to see this show up on the front page now when I wrote this back in 2022. For context, this is a light critique of Guile's CLOS-like OOP system which overall I think is a pretty great approximation of CLOS. I just wanted to write down the things I felt were lacking so I didn't forget them, didn't have to repeat myself whenever one of these issues came up on irc or the mailing list, and could maybe motivate someone to fix them eventually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, I never knew these deficiencies from gooops. This seems to me like a 'scheme with classes' mindset implementation of CLOS. Given the success of C++ and the like, surely there'll be enough people to productively use this. I'd rather have more "proper" CLOS systems in the world though.The FP-world worked successfully in dusting mainstream to have rust be a thing, now if we could replace C++ (and simula and whatnot) class-based "object" systems with object-based object system with more advanced capabilities such as sketched in CLOS, that'd be nice IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42529552</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Against the Hydraulic Analogy" critiques the common analogy that compares information flow in a network to the movement of water through pipes. It argues that this analogy oversimplifies complex systems and does not accurately capture the intricacies of information transfer, particularly in social and technological contexts. The author emphasizes that networks exhibit behaviors and dynamics that differ significantly from fluid dynamics, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of how information propagates and evolves in various environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems unnecessarily negative. Teaching analogies don't need to perfectly resemble the system being taught. From a pedagogical perspective, the aim is typically to relate something unfamiliar to something familiar, like water flowing in a pipe, in order to help someone gain footing in a topic.Further connections can be developed mathematically; electric force propagation does obey wave equations, after all. But by then the analogy has served its purpose and should be droppped in favor of more rigorous knowledge development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Wikipedia doesn’t stop there; here’s their take on the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET):This stood out to me because I have contributed quite a bit to the Wikipedia entry for MOSFET.This illustration does not appear on the Wikipedia entry for a MOSFET: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFETIt only appears on the Wikipedia entry for "hydraulic analogy". People do not learn electronics from the Wikipedia entry for "hydraulic analogy".I assert that it is highly likely that not a single human being on earth has ever used the Wikipedia entry for "hydraulic analogy" to learn electronics. It is likely that several people have used that entry to learn about the hydraulic analogy.Then again, I learned electronics from 1988's The Way Things Work, which uses Wooly Mammoths, large stone edifices, and titanically large humans so maybe I was trained on analogy from an early age and learned to not become too attached to them when they start to break down (like how Wooly Mammoths don't exist anymore).edit: oh goodness I just looked it up and the hydraulic analogy for a circuit in The Way Things Work is utterly magnificent, fantabulous, funny, and educational. No mammoths, unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My problem with this "hydraulic" analogy (first time I've seen it called that) is that I feel most people don't have that good intuition on hydraulics either, so you are just trading one poorly understood subject with another almost as poorly understood one.Maybe 50 years ago engineering students learning electronics could have had more solid hydraulics background knowledge, but I bet these days more people start from electronics before doing hydraulics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526112</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on a novel approach to enhancing the performance of neural networks in low-resource environments through the application of adaptive model compression techniques. The authors explore various methods for optimizing neural network architectures, including pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. The results show significant improvements in computational resource management without sacrificing the model's predictive capabilities, making it particularly beneficial for deployment in mobile and embedded systems. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in making advanced machine learning more accessible and effective in resource-constrained settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still don’t understand how people are getting value out of AI coders. I’ve tried really hard and the commits produced are just a step up from garbage. Writing code from scratch is generally decent. But after a few rounds of edits the assistant just starts piling in conditionals into existing functions until it’s a rats nest 4 layers deep and 100+ lines long. The other day it got into a loop trying to resolve a type error, where  it would make a change, then revert it, then make it againETA: Sorry forgot about the relevancy in my rant! The one area where I’ve found the AIs helpful is enumerating and then creating test cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My cursor workflow for getting tests is to make the test file, import the code under test, and then type cmd-k, “unit tests for &lt;class&gt;”, enter. Add additional cmd-k to prompt for method tests and cases as needed.Pretty basic, would adding more shenanigans get me better results?I try to write doc comments for methods with contracts and it seems cursor/claude does a good job reading and testing those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using LLMs to generate tests is bizarre. If anything, humans should write the tests and the LLMs should make it pass.Tests lose value the further away from the spec they drift. Writing a test after the code causes drift. Writing with an LLM causes even more drift.It ends up being a ritual to appease the unit testing gods rather than an investment that is supposed to pay dividends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531993</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've built quite a few dashboards while working on proof-of-concept feature/product engineering. Even though people often think I'm joking, almost always the backend database was a Google Sheet. Google Sheets has great API support, easy to write functionality, convenient read and file dumps, works well with Pandas/SQL, and has a universally appreciated UX. Data validation can be annoying if the "admin" directly enters data, but for building a proof of concept, nothing beats Google Sheets. The data from Google Sheets would be passed through an API to a web UI/dashboard. The dashboard I built for end users was a simple Bootstrap (Vue-Bootstrap) table from the API, with enough easy-to-use filters and views to work out of the box. If the data was too large, I would use a templated snippet to convert the JSON into a card view. Ignoring long-term maintainability, this was one of the most foolproof ways to build dashboards. After that, I'd slap Firebase Auth on top, and that was it.I haven't worked on these types of projects for nearly two years now. Folks I know use Retool or Softr with an API connectivity platform like Portable, Pipedream, or Zapier. If you're staring at a spreadsheet on a daily basis, the next step should be looking into an app builder combined with an API connection platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried going all on on Google Sheets earlier this year. I used the Python API and like almost nothing worked consistently.I got 1 sheet to work well with like 1k rows and thought woohoo this is great! So I went all-in, put 25k rows in and Google pooped the bed. It gave errors all the time, rows and columns were funky. API issues galore.SQLite however handled 25k rows without any errors, always rock solid.I gave up. Overall a terrible experience once I got past 1k rows. I'm glad it's worked well for you.I only had like 10 columns, so it wasn't like massive amounts of data. I was linking to a file out in Google Drive and that was where most of my issues were. Google drive's API was 99.99% completely useless.My takeaway from the experience was, Google proclaims they have an API, but it seems more like nobody tests it or cares about it. Perhaps it's malicious compliance, they have it because they have to have an API, but not because they expect anyone to actually use it.Perhaps I'm just not cool enough for Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Founder of Glide (YC W19) mentioned in the article — thanks for the recognition.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "Chain of Continuous Thought," which emphasizes the importance of maintaining an uninterrupted flow of reasoning in problem-solving and critical thinking. It elaborates on how this approach can enhance cognitive processes, improve decision-making, and aid in developing more coherent and logical arguments. The piece also highlights techniques for fostering a chain of thought, such as practice, mindfulness, and structured thinking exercises, to refine one's analytical skills and achieve better outcomes in complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. Due to its emphasiss on BFS, it's the opposite of something I've been trying (I named it the "Tree of failures").My assumption was that humans don't try a breadth-first approach. Instead, we split a task into a short-step (instinct and intuition selected), and long-step that summarizes/stores the next steps.  The key idea is to recursively evaluate a task as a short-step (high-res - gets executed) and a long-step (lower-res - is just stored), until it succeeds or fails. If it fails, we must walk back keeping a summarized tree of failures in state so that we can exclude them in future selections.The effectiveness of instinct has a steep fall-off at longer distances - so it's better not to chart out of a series of steps. When we do BFS, we drive down the value of instinct in favor of compute. I guess ultimately, it depends on the type of problem you want to solve.Reach out to me if you want to prototype it with me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769The link is in the OP, hidden away in an image caption fir some reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was waiting for something like that to happen! Next step - creating a human-language-free representation. I believe that once a group of llms can communicate only in embeddings tuned without any human text input, we're going to open a completely new chapter in AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42555320</guid></item><item><title>3.

In the early days internet access was not ubiquitous and shipping an operating system without even a primitive programming environment definitely lead to missed years of programming for me.I learned a lot about windows, lots of UIs and how the system was constructed somewhat, but no visual studio, no functioning compiler in base and the only interpreter being fucking batchfiles with no docs… come on…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Did you know that you can’t write to video memory on the Game Boy Advance in units of 8 bits, and if you do, it’ll still work but all your graphics will be messed up with no obvious way to figure it out unless you read one specific paragraph of the documentation?I did. At one time I did write a program that wrote to video memory in units of 8 bits, but the emulator I was using did not prevent that, so my program worked on the emulator but not on the real hardware, and I could not figure it out until I found out that was the problem and I managed to fix my program so that it would work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42553949</guid></item><item><title>4.

This could happen in various ways: bribe or blackmail someone in law enforcement with access to a lawful intercept management system (LIMS), a supply chain attack on an LIMS vendor, hacking the authentication between networks and LIMS, etc.If it is an LI attack the answer to which networks are compromised is: All of them that support automated LI.That's a nasty attack because LI is designed to not be easily detectable because of worries about network operators knowing who is being tapped.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42555594</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of debugging memory corruption issues in software development, particularly within the context of the Unity game engine. It emphasizes the importance of understanding how memory is allocated and deallocated, and it provides insights into common pitfalls that lead to memory corruption, such as stack overflows and buffer overflows. The piece outlines various tools and techniques developers can use to diagnose and fix these issues, including the use of debuggers, memory profilers, and specific coding practices to enhance memory safety. The aim is to improve the reliability and stability of applications by addressing memory-related bugs effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s been more than a decade since I worked in games, but for my entire games career, any and all use of C++ exceptions was strictly disallowed due to other horror stories. I was still bit in a very similar way by someone’s C++ copy constructor trickery - a crash that only happened in a release build after playing the game for a while, with a stack corruption. Like the author, for me this was one of the hardest bugs I ever had to track down, and I ended up writing a tiny release mode debugger that logged call stacks in order to do it. Once I was able to catch the corruption (after several days of debugging during a crunch weekend), someone on my team noticed the stomp values looked like floating point numbers, and pretty quickly we figured out it was coming from the matrix class trying to be too clever with it’s reference counting IIRC. There’d been a team of around a dozen people trying to track this down during overtime, so it suddenly hit me once we fixed it that someone’s cute idea that took maybe 10 seconds to write cost several tens of thousands of dollars to fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day I used to consult for Sony Ericsson. We had like 5000 engineers writing C code that ran as a single executable in a single address space(!). Memory corruption was rampant. So rampant in fact that when we finally got an MMU it took months before we could turn it on in release builds, because there were so many memory corruption bugs even in the released product. The software just wouldn’t work unless it could overwrite memory here and there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related (and hilarious): https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/thenightwatc...&gt; What is despair? I have known it—hear my song. Despair is

NO HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE THAT IS ALIGNED ON
7. Furthermore, 7 IS TOO SMALL AND ONLY EVIL CODE

On par maybe--as we reach the diminishing returns with our investment in the models, but not win by a wide margin.1. The US trade war with china which will place deepseek compute availability at disadvantages, eventually, if we ever get to that.2. China censorship which limits the deepseek data ingestion and output, to some degree.3. Most importantly, deepseek is open source, which means that the other models are free to copy whatever secret source it has, eg:  Whatever architecture that purportedly use less compute can easily be copied.I've been using Gemini, chatgpt, deepseek and Claudie on regular basis. Deepseek is neither better or worse than others. But this says more about my own limited usage of LLM rather than the usefulness of the models.I want to know exactly what makes everyone thinks that deepseek totally owns the LLM space? Do I miss anything?PS: I am a Malaysian Chinese, so I am certainly not "a westerner who is jealous and fearful of the rise of China"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Liang Wenfeng: We believe that as the economy develops, China should gradually become a contributor instead of freeriding. In the past 30+ years of the IT wave, we basically didn’t participate in real technological innovation.

The issue is that people got used to human-readable hash prefixes of 10-12 characters as "unique" for all intents and purposes, despite the fact that there were never any uniqueness guarantees for prefixes and git has always handled collisions with short object IDs as ambiguous - it's just that it's so rare to happen in the real world that lots of script writers treated that "mostly unique" as a guarantee.IMO support for short object IDs is a mistake, as is any behavior that "works this way 99.999% of the time, but hey developer don't forget you need to also code for that .001% edge case". I'm always just copying and pasting things around anyway, so it really doesn't make much difference to me if I'm copying 12 chars or 64.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First twelve and last twelve characters are the same:    $ echo -n retr0id_662d970782071aa7a038dce6 | sha256sum

Try Claude Sonnet 3.5 (not Haiku!) and tell me if, while still flawed, is not helpful.But there is more: a key thing with LLMs is that their ability to help, as a tool, changes vastly based on your communication ability. The prompt is the king to make those models 10x better than they are with the lazy one-liner question. Drop your files in the context window; ask very precise questions explaining the background. They work great to explore what is at the borders of your knowledge. They are also great at doing boring tasks for which you can provide perfect guidance (but that still would take you hours). The best LLMs (in my case just Claude Sonnet 3.5, I must admit) out there are able to accelerate you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There’s a flipside to this too: a lot of better informed people have sworn off LLMs entirely because they can’t see how anyone could benefit from a tool with so many flaws. The key skill in getting the most out of LLMs is learning to work with tech that is both inherently unreliable and incredibly powerful at the same time. This is a decidedly non-obvious skill to acquire!I wish the author qualified this more. How does one develop that skill?What makes LLMs so powerful on a day to day basis without a large RAG system around it?Personally, I try LLMs every now and then, but haven’t seen any indication of their usefulness for my day to day outside of being a smarter auto complete.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42560558</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm reading a lot of criticism here, some I understand, but honestly, this sounds pretty good for a free LLM service: "Orbit doesn't require account creation or save your session data."Maybe we shouldn't be too critical of Mozilla for providing a privacy-first LLM service - for free. The other big privacy-first LLM provider is Apple, which requires users to have their devices/subscriptions to use, and definitely uses advanced telemetry by default.Not to speak of all the other providers who are either paid or free-but-mine-your-data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess I'm really not this extension's target audience, because somehow Mozilla managed to make me uninstall it in just a few minutes.First, they have forced telemetry. Okay, it's an early release, it's very basic information, they want to understand how they're doing - I don't like it, but I can understand it. Sets a wrong vibe, though - I had to check if it was from Microsoft and not Mozilla. ;-)Then, I figured there is no option to use locally-hosted LLMs, which can be something as minimal as simply allowing to configure custom API URL. Somehow, less and less things about Firefox are tinkerer-friendly than they used to be.That made me wonder if Mozilla used OpenAI-like API, or if they invented their own unique thing for some reason. So I went to look and according to the extension page, it's proprietary ("All Rights Reserved") and I'm too lazy to bother deminifying code from the xpi or remembering how to debug extensions.Finally, '00s have called and said they wanted their weird floating round thingy UI back, and so I had to return it to the store. (I'm kidding, I don't really mind the visual style. The real issue with that thingy was how it floats on the page. Like, why on Earth it isn't normal right-click menu option that doesn't obstruct the view until it's needed? Or a menu on that toolbar button? It's not even a paperclip to be worth it.)And then I realized I somehow missed the big "AI you can trust" header, which should've already been a huge red flag.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Info from the FAQ:- Currently using Mistral 7B, but ability (by Mozilla) to swap the model used to another open source at any point.- Hosted "by Mozilla" on their GCP instance.- No obvious info about what it will cost them to run this since it is free to use.- No training on user data.Like others here, I'm very curious about the cost for Mozilla to run this service.  It may be less than it initially appears given the 7B model they chose.  I do wish they would focus their efforts on creating a very long-term endowment to pay devs for continued Firefox development in lieu of projects like this given the tenuous situation with their Google funding.I'm not against this kind of thing in theory, but I hope it's being done in a cost-sustainable way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42555440</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses 225 systems and ideas related to software engineering and development that may initially seem appealing but can be impractical or counterproductive in real-world applications. It emphasizes the importance of critically evaluating these concepts within the context of actual implementation, advocating for practical and straightforward solutions over complex systems that may not deliver true value. The piece serves as a cautionary guide for software professionals to avoid falling into the trap of adopting trendy ideas without thorough consideration of their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels like problem with these aren't the ideas, rather the "let's just" approach/expectation in front of them.For instance "Let's just add an API." I think the approach to an API as "just" a feature to your product will be about as successful as saying "let's just add a UI". To implement a successful UI one needs to be thoughtful, thorough, and bring in people who specialize in it. Why should any other interface for your product be any different? It's not that it's a bad, or good, idea, rather one that shouldn't "just" be done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) DSLs work great sometimes.  See https://www.jooq.org/(2) Elastic Load Balancer is a control loop responsive to workloads,  that kind of thing is a commodity(3) Under-provisioning is rampant in most industries;  see https://erikbern.com/2018/03/27/waiting-time-load-factor-and... and https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0...(4) Anomaly detection is not inherently a problem of distributed systems like the others,  but someone facing the problems they've been burned with might think they need it.  Intellectually it's tough.  The first algorithm I saw that felt halfway smart was https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/outlier_detection.html#... which is sometimes a miracle and I had good luck using it on text with the CNN-based embeddings we had in 2018 but none at all w/ SBERT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many successful examples of all of these. Using “almost” as an escape hatch doesn’t work here.This is just pessimism and weary cynicism.  I get it, I’ve felt that way too, and sometimes it’s hard to talk an eager engineer out of a bad idea. But for me, this vibe is toxic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42559882</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for Ruby Refrigerator showcases a Ruby library designed to facilitate the management of in-memory key-value stores. It allows for easy manipulation of data and maintains state across various components within Ruby applications. This library is beneficial for developers looking to implement caching or temporary data storage solutions without heavy database interactions, providing a straightforward and efficient approach to handling transient data. Users can access documentation, code examples, and installation instructions to integrate the library into their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42533648"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's cool to see this posted here.  Refrigerator has been around for a number of years, but it doesn't get much press.  It was originally developed as part of my work getting production Ruby web applications to run in chroot environments, where you cannot load libraries after chrooting (for more details, see https://code.jeremyevans.net/presentations/rubyhack2018/inde...).  This allows you to emulate that type of chroot restriction without superuser access.  It also allows you to detect monkey patches of core classes in libraries.Note that it doesn't prevent or discourage monkey-patching, it just requires that you apply your monkey-patches before freezing the core classes.  The idea here is similar to OpenBSD's pledge, where startup and runtime are considered different phases of an application's lifecycle.  After startup, you limit what the runtime can do.  With refrigerator, you freeze the core classes at the end of startup.  So monkey patches are allowed during startup, but not at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of this dark joke https://github.com/garybernhardt/base. This gem creates a "Base" class which literally contains everything!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think I'd use this in production. Testing/development--sure.A class added a method with a require or dynamic definition and that was cause to crash a production activity of some kind? You'd discover the attempted modification via a new FrozenError being raised unexpectedly and crashing what you were doing.Ruby is made to let you extend core classes--Rails does it all over the place. If I put a require behind a feature flag, this is probably going to surprise me when it fails. It might also make junior devs think gems "don't work" or are buggy if you use it in development, when they work fine? How well does this play with dynamic class loading in dev work in Rails? I would think it would be problematic as you can't draw a line in the sand about when everything is loaded, so it is a safe time to "freeze."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42533648</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love to see the ongoing progress here, but I'm really starting to worry that the growth of attestation on Android will make using custom ROMs like LineageOS impossible in future.Is there any way we can fight this? Feels like there must be some EU/US consumer rights or digital market legislation somewhere that could be used to more directly object to organizations like banks saying "your phone works just fine but we actively block you from using it" especially as mobile apps become more and more obligatory for banking. It's a huge problem just in e-waste of old devices that work fine but can't be used because of the lack of updates.Just one legal case upholding this somewhere would put a huge red flag over it and significantly discourage the whole trend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the hood...&gt; Android’s move to trunk-based development, and the subsequent growth in size of Android’s QPRs (Quarterly Platform Releases) have made our job magnitudes harder! As a byproduct we must rebase our entire code-base every 3 months.&gt; Sadly, Google also has a habit of introducing deprecations or outright removing code that older devices rely on with little advanced notice...Google trying new tactics to move Android from open-source to "source available, lol"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highly recommend the Samsung S5e Tablet with LineageOS. It’s an amazing tablet for comics and light reading. Hard to beat its high res AMOLED display, incredibly light weight, and decent enough specs (I haven’t personally seen slowdowns when using Lineage on a minimal install). Forgoing gapps gets you crazy standby time.Couple things to note is it doesn’t have a headphone jack (it is legitimately that thin though) and you are required to use Windows to flash the device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42555066</guid></item><item><title>14.

Chang applies and is accepted into Stanford’s electrical engineering graduate program. He again works hard and graduates in 3 years3 years for a EE PhD is extremely impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested in the story, this is a fantastic podcast episode on the history of TSMC.https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/tsmc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Chang’s immense success with TSMC looks obvious only in hindsight; nobody at the time [...] saw it that way.That's fair but we can also recognize the pattern! We are now familiar with this one. Chang had noticed the need for fabs as a service to all. And he further noticed that it was at the intersection of others' needs: Taiwan looking for local industry, Philips looking for a local boost, established chips and design companies struggling to find the fab space they were ready to pay for, his ITRI mandate. There are no sure thing but we can see the good call and well done to put all the players together - that was plenty as grounds for a new business with good chances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42559052</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I‘m ingesting data from my local weather service into Prometheus and display it in grafana, and what I find most interesting is how the forecast for a certain day changes over time, e.g. seeing how many changes happen until the service lands on the actual precipitation probability for the next hour, as well as correlations between changes across days - something most APIs don’t provide by default but once you feed them into Prometheus you get the historic changes easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did this a few years ago (sans plugin) and correlated weather to velocity and WIP (Jira) for our development team. I was disappointed to find no meaningful correlation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very happy to see Grafana adopt this plugin to continue it's development among all the various other data sources grafana can plugin in to. I'm happy to bring Grafana and it's stack to the work place and developers are very happy using it with their OpenTelemetry integrations. Their only complaint is that some of the settings for panels can be difficult to find.My own wish is that I hope something like this https://github.com/knightss27/grafana-network-weathermap is adopted too. I know it maybe possible using Canvas but Canvas is too much of a blank slate and needs a lot of work to set it up the same way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42558763</guid></item><item><title>16.

There is a darktable fork called ansel https://github.com/aurelienpierreeng/ansel that tries to remove bloat and make darktable more user friendly.It's rather opinionated and done by Aurélien Pierre.For those interested in the why https://ansel.photos/en/news/darktable-dans-le-mur-au-ralent... there is also a YouTube video with strong language. There is an appimage so I recommend people to at least try it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve switched to Linux, and one of the hardest things was to find photo organization software. Adobe Lightroom was good this. I’m still sorting it out on Linux.I tried Darktable and found it really useful for editing raw files. Once you figure out the filters they’re powerful and professional.Darktable really opionated about how it stores files/ libraries however.  It really wants you to have one library for all your photos, where I used separate libraries for various events I’ve photographed.  Also going through and ranking photos wasn’t as straight forward (is it applying the rank to the image on the strip on the bottom vs the image in the main window?)So I’m sorting with digikam, though it’s editing features don’t seem as powerful.  It’s a process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations to the Darktable team on their latest release.I tried and tried with Darktable, but found the UI and features extremely frustrating. This [1] post, about a year ago, convinced me to stop inflicting pain on myself and move on. I use Capture One Pro now and am happy with the decision.But I'm glad that DT exists as a FOSS solution for those who want that.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38412582&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42558037</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's so great to see this:&gt; I took my first baby steps in Blender back in 2017I believe I took mine in 2001-2002. Coincidentally, this was my introduction to the concept of "open source" software. The idea that such a powerful tool could be completely and irrevocably free was just absolutely mind blowing. And it allowed me to create the sort of precise, intricate things that were inaccessible in any other way as I, as an 8th-grader, had not yet accumulated any machine tools.Glad to see this program is still going strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool to see the whole process behind it. Some sneaky tricks there, and much knowledge. Unfortunately, I find the picture doesn't show the tidally-lockedness very well. If it wasn't for the title, I would never have noticed. The haze on the sun side makes it look like clouds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey everyone, Samuel here. As I mentioned in the article, I started rewriting the shader math from scratch with proper projection math in mind.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the implications of relicensing open-source projects and the fate of their forks when original projects are re-licensed under different terms. It discusses the legal and community dynamics that arise from such changes, detailing how forked projects maintain their original licenses while new developments may be constrained by the updated terms. The piece highlights real-world examples to illustrate the challenges developers face in navigating these licensing shifts and emphasizes the need for clear communication within the open-source community to mitigate misunderstandings and disputes. Ultimately, it underscores the importance of thoughtful licensing decisions in maintaining project collaboration and continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time I see some post where commits are taken as contribution metrics, I remember when, after working for months at it, I merged Redis Cluster into Redis as a single commit, and saw the pale green square appearing for that day in my GitHub contributions chart. Now it's 1.5 months that I work 10h/day at Redis Vector Sets and they will also be a single commit. It's very simple to do better than that, as a metric: different developers have different habits. For me, a stream of changes of early-day design just pollute the contribution history. Starting from a solid and advanced beta, then yes, history is great to have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The topic is indeed very interesting but before studying commit author diversity it would be useful to understand the volume and traction. Statistically most of the forks are dead ends, even if maintained by a few enthusiasts for some time.I'm sure opensearch won't die until it's a commercial offering of AWS but how is going? Any new features coming, a product roadmap exists? Or it's mainly bugfixes and maintenance? What about Opentofu?Even something basic like a graph of LOC changed over time, with a fork in the middle would help to put the article into perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As with many more modern "Open source" projects, the openness is more of a "You can try for free, and once you need production level SLA come call us". While the source code is available to look at it's more of a facade as almost no one change it but the owning company. Limited by complexity of the project, maintainer politics and IP around supporting tools and materials.OSS has basically theseus shiped into something completely different.
Not a criticism  just an observation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535354</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Advent of Code, a popular coding challenge that occurs annually in December, focusing on how large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to enhance the coding experience during this event. It explores the ways LLMs can assist participants by providing hints, generating code snippets, and solving problems more efficiently. The piece highlights the potential benefits and capabilities of leveraging LLMs for both novice and experienced programmers, encouraging a collaborative approach to problem-solving and skill development throughout the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article and comments here _really_ underestimate the current state of LLMs (or overestimate how hard AoC 2024 was)Here's a much better analysis from someone who got 45 stars using LLMs. https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hnk1c5/resul...All the top 5 players on the final leaderboard https://adventofcode.com/2024/leaderboard used LLMs for most of their solutions.LLMs can solve all days except 12, 15, 17, 21, and 24&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of mirror my experience with LLMs. If I ask them non-original problems (make this API, write this test, update this function (that must be written 100s of time by develoeprs around the world, etc), it works very well. Some minors changes here and there but it saves time.When I ask them to code things that they never heard of (I am working on a online sport game), it fails catastrophically. The LLM should know the sport, and what I ask is pretty clear for anyone who understand the game (I tested against actual people and it was obvious what to expect), but the LLM failed miserably. Even worse when I ask them to write some designs in CSS for the game. It seems if you take them outside the 3-columsn layout or bootstrap or the overused landing page, LLMs fails miserably.It works very well for the known cases, but as soon as you want them to do something original, they just can't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After looking at the charts I was like "Whoa, damn, that Jerpint model seems amazing.  Where do I get that??"  I spent some time trying to find it on Huggingface before I realized...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42551863</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that the OpenStreetMap community provides a mature toolscape that allows projects like this to access geospatial data for anyone, no questions asked. It's hard to overstate how valuable this kind of resource is to the free software community.Just to give some perspective: More than 10 years ago I built an open source project that generates cities for a different game (maps4cim [1], a map generator for Cities in Motion 2). It relies on OSM data to generate roads and buildings and stuff, and NASA SRTM data for elevations. The OSM part of the application is far more complicated, since it covers so much data that is changing every day, yet you can make the exact same query against the Overpass API and get a response with the latest data in the expected format. NASA however at some point decided to shut down public access to SRTM data, which is in the public domain, and hide it behind a non-RESTful webservice where only registered users have access.To me this feels like such a loss. I never would have started this open source project a decade ago if there was no free access to all the data the users would need. Yes, it's still public domain data, therefore someone could go through all the hassle of signing up for the service, scrape all the data and then host it free of charge, but right now there is no such service. Don't get me wrong, I don't feel entitled to this kind of free service, but I feel like these barriers to entry really matter and we all lose access to great tools that are built on the shoulders of giants. Very sad to lose NASA as one of the giants that once gave us free and easy access to highly useful data. More power to projects like OSM that live the spirit of open data!1: https://github.com/Klamann/maps4cim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm just here to say thanks, as I'm not above taking credit for creating our neighborhood in Minecraft for my 8yo. There's nothing in the GPL that prohibits creating false heroes AFAIK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be awesome if it could generate street signs at intersections. I’d love to use it to help my kids get more familiar with our area. Theyre tired of me constantly asking for street names or which way to turn. Sometimes, they even give me full turn-by-turn instructions, and we have only gotten lost a couple of times so far ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42561711</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I man don't get me wrong, I love the idea of PWAs but this dude is out to lunch. It's so painful making anything complex work cross browser/cross platform. On iOS iirc they don't even support adding PWAs to the homescreen? You definitely can't Bluetooth outside of Chrome (probably only on Android and Windows too because nothing fun is ever allowed on Macs).Multiplayer games you kind of need UDP. You cannot UDP in the browser (WebRTC data channels technically use UDP but that stack is an abomination wrapped in SCTP and DTLS)This is by no means an exhaustive list, just issues I've dealt with recently. It's better than it was with WebGPU and WASM, some of the gap between a native app and a website is surmountable, but unless you're doing something extremely boring surmounting the gap is hard fucking work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd give anything to move our apps to the web. We're in the medical field (our apps connect to medical devices over Bluetooth), so publishing on Google Play is like a Kafkaesque fever dream. Two days ago they tell us our app fits into categories like:Activity and FitnessNutrition and Weight ManagementSleep ManagementMedical Device AppsSo we gotta update our policies, but today they said something like: "Actually, jk, you don't qualify as a Medical Device App anymore - app update rejected."Meanwhile, Apple (who used to be the actual nightmare) has somehow turned into the reasonable one. They approve apps in minutes now. MINUTES.It's like Google saw Apple's approval process from 10 years ago and thought, "Let's do that, but make it a circus." At this point, I dream of ditching native apps entirely. Too bad Bluetooth on the web is still a bit... fragile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the web platform is catching up due to the continuous supply of abstractions by modern browsers, once you must deviate from those abstractions, you quickly find yourself needing to implement something yourself that is much less efficient than a native implementation.I wrote about developing my own block editor from scratch[1] using C++ and QML after finding that Notion (and so many other web apps) are extremely slow and inefficient - in terms of CPU/RAM/battery life.I detailed a comparison between native and web block editors, and the difference is huge. The fastest web app (MarkText) is 60x slower at loading texts and uses 3x more RAM than my native app. Also, all web apps couldn't handle loading a very large text file (they were all hanging).Modern computers are blazing fast and efficient, there's no reason a text editor couldn't load large files. This is why, in my view, web apps aren't really the progress people make them to be. We're going backward, not forward, with web apps. This need to change.[1] https://rubymamistvalove.com/block-editor[2] https://rubymamistvalove.com/block-editor#8-performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557172</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of software provenance, which refers to the history and origin of software components and their dependencies. It emphasizes the need for transparent and traceable software development practices to ensure integrity, security, and compliance in modern software systems. The author outlines various strategies for enhancing software provenance, including the use of metadata, automated documentation, regular audits, and tools that can manage dependencies effectively. By ensuring proper software provenance, organizations can better manage risks associated with software supply chains and foster trust in their software products.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before the modern Cloud took shape, developers (or at least, the software they created) used to be more trustworthy.I love those classic tools from the likes of Sysinternals or Nirsoft.  I didn't hesitate to give them full access to my machine, because I was confident they'd (mostly) work as expected.  Although I couldn't inspect their source, I could reason about how they should behave, and the prevailing culture of the time was one where I knew the developers and myself shared a common set of expectations.Their creators didn't tend to pull stunts like quietly vacuuming all your data up to themselves.  When they did want feedback, they asked you for it first.There wasn't such a potent "extract value" anti-culture, and successful companies recognized enduring value came from working in the user's best interest (eg. early Google resisted cluttering their search results).Although silos existed (like proprietary data formats), there was at least an implicit acknowledgement and expectation you retained ownership and control over the data itself.Distribution wasn't locked behind appstores.  Heck, license enforcement in early Office and Windows was based on the honour system - talk about an ecosystem of trust.One way to work toward a healthier zeitgeist is to advocate tirelessly for the user at every opportunity you get, and stand by your gut feeling of what is right - even when faced with opposing headwinds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software had it way too easy for way too long. You could ship faulty code to billions without anyone blinking an eye. It was just harmless ideas after all.The stakes are now higher with data being so important and the advent of algorithms that affect people directly. From health insurance claims, to automated trading, social media drugs and ai companions, bad code today can and does ruin lives.Software engineers, like every other engineer have to be held accountable for code they sign off and ship. Their livelihoods should be on the line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I consider myself quite promiscuous when trusting software but sometimes just can't. Seeing how signal desktop does 100MB updates every week, or the big ball of coalesced mud that is typescript compiler, made me avoid these. Why there isn't more pushback against that complexity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534918</guid></item><item><title>27.

The best part of the German sketch is that before the sketch there's a presenter explaining why it's funny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/tv/dinner-for-one-sendezeiten-...Airs on NDR, WDR, MDR, SWR, BR, HR, RBB (the regional broadcasters, N stands for North, W for West, easy enough) a total of 11 times, plus 6 times in re-stagings in various dialects (no dubbing here).Then once on Das Erste (The First, run by the collaborative federal broadcaster ARD, of the above).And once on ORF's (Austria's public broadcaster) ORF 1.And the Swiss have their own recording of the same sketch, performed by the same two, but with variations of course, once each on SRF 1 and SRF 2 respectively, and the German version on SRF 2 once.In a nutshell, it's on the TV schedule 22 times. Probably a bit more than that if you properly count RB and SR (smaller broadcasters whose schedule is mostly affiliated with NDR and SWR respectively). If you count those separately, add another 7 times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of little known shows in their own country becoming iconic outside,Are Germans aware how popular the "Didi's Comedy Show" was in India during the 80s?I grew up with that show and still crack up at Didi's antics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42560171</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;Agentarium is an open-source project that provides a framework for developing intelligent agents using reinforcement learning. It aims to simplify the creation and testing of agent-based systems by offering a modular architecture and pre-built components for various tasks and environments. The project encourages collaboration and contributions from developers and researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, fostering advancements in agent technology. The repository includes documentation, examples, and tools to help users get started with building their own agents efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It sounds very similar to AI town - there's been a couple attempts at building virtual playgrounds for chatbots to interact with each other, and vote on solutions if they're trying to come up with a consensus. In that respect, it's probably similar to how mixture of experts work but just modeled at a higher level.https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-townThe big thing that you want though is diversity in terms of each of the AI's, and I'm not convinced that altering temperature / system context prompt / optional backing RAG represents sufficient variety from virtual bot to virtual bot.Ideally, you would want to throw as many different LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, etc.) into the mix as possible, but hardware constraints make this borderline impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool. I think agent based simulations with LLM are really cool. 
Just last week I was talking with a Professor of Economy about the use of such simulations for their research.Some background: For my PhD thesis, about 8 years ago, did I simulate how voice agents can influence humans. I did that with an agent based simulations. 
Before I did the simulation I gathered actually influence values by doing experiments with human participants.The limitations however were, I only had basically one dimensions of influence.With LLM, we can create all sort of actors. And play scenarios, like introducing a new legislation and see how different types of the population will react.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes the "agents".  From what I can tell, they don't perform any external actions.  I would call these chatbots...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521259</guid></item><item><title>29.

If the goal was to study how different LLMs interpret financial data there would be no use for actual trades, since their interpretation cannot be influenced by the fact that the trading orders are  passed for real.I believe the goal is to see if AI can do better than rats [0].
There is no shame in that.[0]: https://www.vice.com/en/article/rattraders-0000519-v21n12/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT has one trade that is guaranteed to be bad. I'm not saying unprofitable, just bad. GBTC is the bitcoin ETF with biggest expense ratio - 1.5%. If you want to bet on bitcoin, a better choice would be BITB (0.20%) or BTC (0.15%).Also, the reasoning is partially a hallucination - "The holding period of 9 months aligns with the expected completion of Grayscale's pivotal Phase 3 Bitcoin ETF trial, a major catalyst for unlocking investor demand and driving trust value realization."There is no such thing as a "holding period", nor are they doing a "Phase 3 Bitcoin ETF trial". It's possible the "Phase 3" thing is picked up from news about a drug company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They should have added a pure random bot as a control.Or a monkey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42559744</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the NetBSD Build System provides an overview of the build process for the NetBSD operating system, detailing its modular architecture and various components. It explains how the build system is designed for flexibility and efficiency, allowing developers to compile the operating system and its packages in a streamlined manner. The piece also discusses the configuration options available to customize builds, the importance of source management, and the tools utilized throughout the process. Overall, it serves as a guide for understanding how to effectively work with the NetBSD build system.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's hard to overstate how awesome build.sh is.  If you have some powerful desktop/laptop running virtually any modern POSIX OS, you can easily build for an embedded board like an RPi or Beagelboard, obscure retro targets, or standard systems all the same.  The closest thing is maybe Yocto Linux, but a whole lot easier to use and understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; NetBSD build system allows you to build the full OS from scratch, on pretty much any host POSIX platform, while targeting any hardware architecture supported by NetBSD. All without root privileges.That seems fairly standard to me though? Yocto, buldroot, many other embedded-oriented systems provide that and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just updated pkgsrc from 2024Q3 to 2024Q4 for amd64 and i386, very easy.I never built NetBSD because I never had the need to do that.  But from what I read its cross-compiling works very well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530459</guid></item><item><title>31.

I know there are 3rd party solutions but for as mature as the framework is, you'd think it could get a first party solution. The same goes for several API's that you'd think are core to game making, like sprite animations. There are fairly mature libraries, but I always hate having a bunch of patchwork libraries that should be included batteries instead of 3rd party boilerplate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To the OP, try DragonRuby for your next game if you miss hot reloading but like the scripting, code-first nature of LÖVE. It’s also cross-platform. Not sponsored, just a big fan and it scratches many of the same itches as you described with LÖVE.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42562175</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Penrose Maze, a non-periodic tiling created by mathematician Roger Penrose. It explores the unique properties of this tiling, including its aperiodicity, meaning it can cover a surface without repeating patterns. The author describes the mathematical significance and artistic implications of the Penrose Maze, highlighting its connection to concepts in mathematics and physics, as well as its aesthetic appeal in art and design. The piece aims to illustrate the beauty of mathematical patterns through the lens of the Penrose Maze.&lt;/p&gt;

I spent five or ten minutes finding dead ends in the green area and gave up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an efficient way to generate a random maze!First you create an initial maze, and randomly remove a wall. This generates a loop in your maze. Then in the loop you randomly add one wall, this removes the loop in the maze while keeping all cells reachable. As you iterate this operation your maze will get more and more different.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42529894</guid></item><item><title>35.

So we first select for neoteny (playfulness, dependency on caregiver, physical features people like) basically prolonging the juvenile state. Then we put them in controlled environments of abundance, were all their needs are met. Which further diminishes need to reach adult state (with traits like aggressiveness to compete for resources). This abundance causes them to mature/breed earlier and reproduce more than in the wild. Basically a population of children that can produce children. Then we want this population of children to live longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many of you glance at this website and think "fraud engine"?

  standalone, distributed, auditable, provable, minimalisthttps://justine.lol/
  APE (actually portable executable);
  cosmopolitan libc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TL;DR: this is an exercise in implementing a C compiler from scratch. "From scratch" here means "without an existing gcc/clang," so consider civilization destruction scenarios, aliens reading our source code, EMP strike that takes out all smart silicon, corporate policy won't let you download development tools, you only have a javascript console and gumption, etc...To do this, you must:1. Implement a small tool that turns hexidecimal into binary (you can do this in any language)2. Use whatever you have (python, POSIX shell, alien crystal substrate, x86-64 machine code, ...) to implement a small VM that runs simple bytecode. The VM has 16 registers and 16MB of working memory. There are sixteen opcodes to implement for arithmetic, memory manipulation, and control flow. There are also twelve syscalls for fopen/fread/fwrite/unlink(!)/etc.After these two steps (that you have to repeat yourself post-civilization collapse), everything's self-hosted:3. Use the VM to write a manual linker that resolves labels4. Use the linker to write assembler for a custom assembly language5. Use the assembler to implement a minimal C compiler / preprocessor, that then compiles a more complex C compiler, that can compile a C17 compiler, that then compiles doomSee also: nand2tetris (focus is on teaching, less pragmatism), Cosmopolitan C (x64 as actually portable runtime)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what's the author's view on Forth, seems like the role of the bytecode VM here might be interchangeable with a Forth implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42547086</guid></item><item><title>41. 3D-printed neighborhood nears completion in Texas</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/worlds-largest-3d-printed-neighborhood-060654029.html</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have the ability to pump concrete, and a gantry across the whole site, why wouldn't you pick and place concrete blocks or other materials rather than concrete the whole thing on site?Also, aren't these walls significantly more CO2 unfriendly than lumber, and more difficult to renovate? What if I need to get a builder in to do repairs, is there a concrete wall guy who knows how to repair them?Can it print multi family housing?It takes four weeks to print, which seems long to frame a single story three bedroom house. If the home buyer isn't feeling savings, what's the draw here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems pointless and expensive, and it's concrete that doesn't lend itself to modification or repair. 3D printing in this case appears to be used as a tech gimmick rather than an actually-scalable process, or it would already be in-use everywhere.The most inherently sensible home would be protected from wind (derecho, hurricane, and the uncommon tornado), fire, flooding, and severe heat and cold (and associated climate control costs) by building mostly underground on flat, stable, high ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"...range in price from around $450,000 to close to $600,000."In other words, there is little economic incentive to recommend this construction method.  Not much in the way of aesthetics either --- unless you want a ranch box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531237</guid></item><item><title>42.

It was really useful. Charmin bought it at some point, and it existed for a while after that, but like most of the cool apps, it’s gone now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of an old project of mine on similar theme.Years ago, as a frustrated young parent, I created a similar project which helped me find toilets near me.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find that one drawback of building your software by knitting together existing frameworks or libraries is that their design choices, interfaces, and abstractions are fixed (and typically not in a way that they are going to fit together seamlessly).This results in the need for glue-code, sometimes lots, and when you encounter architectural problems, you are much more constrained in how you can resolve them.Sometimes that constraint is more than offset by the time saved writing the code, sometimes not.Unless it's something really obvious or standard, these days I tend to start off with a "write it myself" mindset, until I really know I need something off the shelf, which is definitely the reverse of how I was when started my career and had a "just use a library" mindset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; realized I had programmed myself into a corner.A lesson that the world seems to repeatedly reinforce is that quests to create something complicated with rigid adherence to pure/dogmatic/'perfect' abstraction end up this way.The systems I've seen that don't jack knife themselves into oblivion grow like weeds and age like a forest. There's a perfect kind of messy where each little module takes takes root, being tested by the ecosystem and growing or dying.Contrary to what many think, I don't think spaghetti nightmares happen in this mode unless code becomes functionally immortal by means other than battle testing.Sometimes this happens because somebody's ego forces any woodbe gardeners to litigate all attempts at tending. Sometimes it happens because the pressure to X rises too high and it extinguishes all the controlled burns.I remember wanting to feel like the thing I made was absolutely crystalline. Seeing how that ends has made me appreciate the organism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I gave this module its own immutable state. The state could be modifiedthis made me chuckle a bit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531215</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;BYD has emerged as the world's largest automaker in terms of research and development workforce, surpassing traditional leaders in the automotive industry. The company boasts over 40,000 employees dedicated to R&amp;D, significantly outpacing competitors such as Toyota and Volkswagen. This expansion reflects BYD's commitment to innovation, particularly in electric vehicles and battery technology, positioning it as a frontrunner in the transition to sustainable transportation.

They are scaling like crazy, I hope they keep it up, might turn out to be one of the biggest forces in mitigating emissions. The legacy auto companies who only sell expensive luxury EVs deserve to be crushed by BYD and friends, I have no sympathy left at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Fashion in the automobile industry. I wish we would focus on Cars that last 20+ years again instead.Cars that are repairable, that have common parts across the industry so any mechanic can work on them.Maybe even upgradeable cars so you can make it more environmentally when new technology develops.Will they be the most environmentally friendly to drive? No probably not, but the manufacturing of cars is super environmentally expensive too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes BYD had the most R&amp;D staff, but that's the problem: There are simply too many brands under BYD's umbrella. Every line-up tries to re-invent the wheel with R&amp;D of their own- The vanilla BYD (discontinued, mostly ICE cars)- the E series- Dynasty series- Ocean series- Formula Leopard- Denza- Yangwang- commercial vehicles, batteries, railway transports, OEMs, etc.And many models are overlapping with each other. Jack of all trades, the best selling one is the Seagull from the Ocean series and it costs about $10k&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42556408</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses static search trees, a data structure that allows for efficient searching, inserting, and deleting of data while maintaining a fixed size and structure. It explains the underlying principles of static search trees, compares them with dynamic search trees, and highlights their advantages in scenarios where the data set is known and remains constant. The article includes illustrations and examples to clarify the concepts, making it accessible for readers interested in data structures and algorithm efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totally off topic, but I've started to notice that more and more algorithmic low-ish level content assumes Rust by default. My entire life I've been used to anything algorithmic being either written in sciency pseudocode (invariably in latex-generated PDFs), or plain old C(++), the vulgar latin of computer programming. I know C and I don't really know Rust but nevertheless I love that this is changing! I'd never advise a new programmer interested in low-level/fast stuff to begin with C now, so much good content is written around Rust. Like the old C examples, the post doesn't even say "this is Rust". You're expected to expect it to be Rust.And, well the language choice doesn't really matter for the core subject here. I could follow this post fine even though I don't really know Rust (just like I assume a Rust programmer could follow a well written algorithms deep dive with examples in C with a bit of dedication). EDIT okok that was a lie, I could follow the first half of this post, ish, and then it got way too deep for me.But anyway, standardize on Rust, I like it. I'd love if a bit more Zig was thrown into the mix here but either of them feel like a better default than C at this point to me. After decades of C being The Standard for this stuff, I love that this is finally changing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One dimension that is not explored is partitioning the queries in batches. The primary cost is doing lookups on the out-of-cache table, so if you have a sufficiently large amount of queries you can resolve a couple layers of the tree in one step while those layers are in cache, grouping them based on where they land deeper in the tree, and then resolving all those queries that touch the same deeper part of the tree in one batch as well.In theory, with an infinitely large amount of input queries you will never have to do an out-of-cache lookup, it can be completely amortized away into linear scans.That said, you now end up with a bunch of results that need to be put back into the correct output order, which likely makes it not worth it. But if the operation can be fused into a reduction (e.g. find the sum of the binary search results) or the output order does not matter in some other way then all of a sudden it might make sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazingly thorough ! I love how the author leaves no stone unturned. I had no idea you could do the kind of low level efficiency shaving in Rust.
I wonder how a C++ implementation with https://github.com/jfalcou/eve would compare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42562847</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "An Unreasonable Amount of Time" by Allen Pike explores the concept of time in the context of modern work culture, emphasizing how it impacts productivity and creativity. Pike argues that the traditional expectations surrounding time management often lead to burnout and reduced effectiveness. Instead, he advocates for a more flexible approach to time allocation, suggesting that allowing for periods of unstructured time can foster innovation and personal well-being. The piece offers insights on how individuals and organizations can rethink their relationship with time to achieve better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a pleasant surprise and a pleasant read. Its message reminds me of the words of Shunryu Suzuki:&gt; As to progress -- we don’t know how much progress we made, actually, but if you practice it you will realize -- some day you will realize that our progress is not -- it is not possible to make rapid, extraordinary progress. Even though you try very hard, you cannot actually make progress. The progress you make is always little by little. It is like -- to go through fog. You don’t know when you get wet, but if you just walk through fog you will be wet, little by little, even though you don’t know -- it is not like a shower.&gt; When you go out when it is showering you will feel, ‘Oh, that’s terrible!”. It is not so bad but when you get wet by fog it is very difficult to dry yourself. This is how we make progress. So actually there is not need to worry about your progress. Just to do it is the way. It is, maybe, like to study language. Just repeating, you will master it. You cannot do it all of a sudden. This is how we practice, especially Soto way, is to do it little by little. To make progress little by little. Or we do not even mind, we do not expect to make progress, just to do it is our way. The point is to do it with sincerity in each moment. That is the point. There should not be Nirvana besides our practice.Source: https://www.shunryusuzuki.com/detail1?ID=80&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good example (in my twisted mind) is the folks that set up concerts and sports games.I have a friend, who runs setup of major venues. Like, stadiums and conference centers, for big-time events (thousands of people).The deal is, that a whole lot of moving parts, need to come together, for one event, and there can be no screwups[0].Takes a lot of planning, prep work, validation, and, most importantly, experience (my friend is in his sixties), as there are bound to be curveballs, and newbies aren't very good at handling out-of-band events.Not many people can actually do it, but almost everyone thinks they can do it.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOSDrT_eDhk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great, useful article. Remember: the same principle holds in the world of the psyche. Those people walking around, seeming effortlessly happy? Unless if they're little children, a horrendous amount of effort has been invested to their inner peace. It took me years to realize that.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive CAPTCHA solution that uses a game-like interface inspired by the classic Doom video game. Users must navigate through a simple shooting mechanics game to complete the CAPTCHA, making the process engaging while effectively verifying that users are human. The design combines retro aesthetics with modern functionality, enhancing the typical CAPTCHA experience by offering a playful alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach involving the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for improving the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. The authors present a framework that integrates GANs with traditional training methods to enhance the model's ability to withstand input perturbations. They provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of their method on various datasets, showing improved performance and reduced vulnerability to adversarial examples compared to existing techniques. The study emphasizes the potential of GANs in creating more resilient machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when this stuff was all coming out and people were finally excited about ChatGPT getting the problem with "which is heavier, a 10 pound bag of feathers or a 10 pound bag of bricks?" problem correct. But of course it got it correct. It was in the training set. Vary the problem slightly by just changing the nouns, or changing the numbers so that one in fact was heavier than the other, and performance went all over the map.I just went to chatgpt.com and put into the chat box "Which is heavier, a 9.99-pound back of steel ingots or a 10.01 bag of fluffy cotton?", and the very first answer I got (that is, I didn't go fishing here) was    The 9.99-pound bag of steel ingots is heavier than the 10.01-pound
    bag of fluffy cotton by a small margin. Although the cotton may
    appear larger due to its fluffy nature, the steel ingots are denser
    and the weight of the steel bag is 9.99 pounds compared to the 10.01
    pounds of cotton. So, the fluffy cotton weighs just a tiny bit more
    than the steel ingots.

Which, despite getting it both right and wrong, must still be graded as a "fail".If you want to analyze these thing for their true capability, you need to make sure you're out of the training set... and most of the things that leap to your mind in 5 seconds are leaping to your mind precisely because they are either something you've seen quite often or something that you can easily think of and therefore many other people have easily thought of them as well. Get off the beaten path a bit and the math gets much less impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One experiment I would love to see, although not really feasible in practice, is to train a model on all digitized data from before the year 1905 (journals, letters, books, broadcasts, lectures, the works), and then ask it for a formula for mass-energy equivalence. A certain answer would definitely settle the debate on whether pattern recognition is a form of intelligence ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance of these LLMs on real life tasks feels very much like students last-minute cramming for Asian style exams.The ability to perfectly regurgitate, while no concept of meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565606</guid></item><item><title>6.

Ten years ago now, so hopefully not needed anymore, but was a fun project:
https://github.com/Matsemann/mDjiControllerThose first generation consumer drones were so wack. Hard to fly, and very brittle software. I lost it when it randomly decided to "fly home" when I took off from a new location without storing a new gps location. I just had to watch it go straight north and out of view.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42532014</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, the reasons why Redis commands API suck in Andy's video (linked in the post) are the weakest ever. It is possible to make a case against the Redis API (I would not agree of course but... it's totally legitimate), but you gotta have stronger arguments than those, particularly if you are a teacher of some kind. Especially: you need to be somewhat fluent in Redis and how developers use Redis in order to understand why so many people like it, and then elaborate what it's wrong about it (if you believe there is something wrong). The video shows a general feeling of "I don't really use / know this, but I don't like how NON-SQL it is".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions Greenplum, but it's worth noting that when the code was closed, several of the original developers created an open-source fork, Cloudberry, which seems to be thriving. Cloudberry was accepted into the Apache project this year, and has synced with Postgres 14, whereas the closed-source Greenplum is still stuck on Postgres 12.The architecture is quite ancient at this point, but I'm not sure it's completely outdated. It's single-master shared-nothing, with shards distributed among replicas, similar to Citus. But the GPORCA query planner is probably the most advanced distributed query planner in the open source world at this point. From what I know, Greenplum/Cloudberry can be significantly faster than Citus thanks to the planner being smarter about splitting the work across shards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This take screams more than a technical criticism but of something personal. 
“I'll be blunt: I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow. Our experiments at CMU found Dragonfly to have much more impressive performance numbers (even with a single CPU core). In my database course, I use the Redis query language as an example of what not to do.” (From the article)Of course it’s not to be used as a general purpose DB it’s keys and values. Used for caches and things like that. In my experience in real world scenarios and loads vanilla single threaded Redis is stable, fast, and nigh bulletproof.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42566192</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilarious irony:&gt; With hindsight, some of my past rejections have become amusing.  With a coauthor, I once almost solved a conjecture, establishing the result with an "epsilon loss" in a key parameter.  We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.&gt; The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.  This time, the paper was rejected for only being an epsilon improvement over the previous literature!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2005, my paper on breaking RSA by observing a single private-key operation from a different hyperthread sharing the same L1 cache -- literally the first publication of a cryptographic attack exploiting shared caches -- was rejected from the cryptology preprint archive on the grounds that "it was about CPU architecture, not cryptography".  Rejection from journals is like rejection from VCs -- it happens all the time and often not for any good reason.(That paper has now been cited 971 times according to Google Scholar, despite never appearing in a journal.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was confused by the title because paper rejection is incredibly common in research, but that's the point and one of the goals is to fight imposter syndrome.It's a good initiative. Next step: everybody realizes that researchers are just random people like everybody. Maybe that could kill any remaining imposter syndrome.A rejection, although common, is quite tough during your PhD though, even ignoring the imposter syndrome, because in a short time, you are expected to have a bunch of accepted papers, in prestigious publications if possible. It feels like a rejection slows you down, and the clock is still ticking. If we could kill some of this nefarious system, that'd be good as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42568399</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just cross posting my lobsters post:I want to say thanks to @dgl for reporting this, and this article is also expertly written.I also have to say for me personally its quite embarrassing because as I told @dgl when he reported this: I’ve studied his work before and made it a note to test Ghostty against his past discoveries prior to release. And I… quite simply forgot. I didn’t make an issue for myself so it slipped away and here I am with egg on my face. I’m sorry!But, I appreciate @dgl for the security report, reviewing the fix, and continuing to be an active user of the terminal. I also shared with him some broader thoughts on terminal security in general. Addressing terminal security in a more fundamental way is one of the first proposals I want to make regarding terminal innovation.My thinking is still too early and under-researched for a formal proposal. But my general feeling having built a terminal over the past 2 years is that the security surrounding escape sequences is fundamentally flawed and poking one by one at these sequences to try to make them individually safe doesn’t feel like the right long term solution.The surface area is too large and the complexity of some of the newer sequences too high (i.e. Kitty Graphics) to be confident in secure implementations. DoS is far too easy with terminals (Ghostty has a handful of known DoS attacks, but so does pretty much every other terminal I know of). And some legacy sequences are just kind of shocking to have immediately available. For example, DECCOLM is available in macOS Terminal.app. If you issue a DECCOLM (CSI ? 3 h I believe), Terminal.app will physically resize the window and lock it to 132 columns. You can very easily crash Terminal.app at anytime by sending enough of these (a DoS attack). There are many more.Part of my thinking is trying to design a mechanism that can effectively create something akin to either CPU protection rings or OpenBSD’s pledge() syscall. Whatever the mechanism, the general idea is: reduction of capability.For example, it makes sense for a shell to be extremely powerful. It’s literally a code execution device. However, it doesn’t make much sense for cat to be able to execute arbitrary escape sequences (which it does today in any terminal). Whether it is the shell or cat itself, something should be able to tell a terminal: “hey, only execute some subset of escape sequences (or none at all).” For cat, that might be none or perhaps just SGR sequences (styles, colors, etc.). The insecurity of cat-ing or tail-ing any form of data that could contain user-generated data is hopefully well known at this point…As I said before, this thinking is all still very raw and I don’t have anything concrete to proposal. I want to share this because I want folks to know that I’m thinking about it, and perhaps others may be interested in thinking about it with me… if so, please contact me. I’ve already shared this line of thinking with @dgl as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish that 1% of the sustained effort that is currently being devoted to building terminal emulators and TUI applications was collectively redirected at researching a better future to fill this niche.Terminal emulators and TUI applications belong with the DMG Gameboys, Commodore 64's, and DOSBoxes: as a historical curiosity and something for the enthusiasts to enjoy after hours. But we've come to rely on them almost to the point where they're being fetishised; most of us using this technology nowadays aren't even questioning its negative impact.We need better command line / REPL environments. We need better cross-platform GUI toolkits. We need better remote access. And we need to let go of the TV teletype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m impressed with how many bugs (security and otherwise) have been fixed and new features included [0] in the 1.0.1 release, considering the first public release (1.0) was only 5 days ago.[0]: https://ghostty.org/docs/install/release-notes/1-0-1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42562743</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This maps a little to what we are doing research on what we are calling as shape of stories[1].We can clearly see in 2D space itself how different "concepts" are explored.Using the shape of stories for semantic chunking we can clearly see in multiple articles how we can chunk by "concepts". [2]Now we are trying to see if we can just use these chunks and train a next "chunk" predictor instead of a next word predictor.In the paper, they take a sentence to mean a concept. We believe that a "semantic chunk" is better suited for a concept instead of a sentence.[1] https://gpt3experiments.substack.com/p/the-shape-of-stories-...[2]https://gpt3experiments.substack.com/p/a-new-chunking-approa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like a failure to learn the bitter lesson: You're just taking the translation to concepts that the LLM is certainly already doing and trying to make it explicitly forced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What used to be feature engineering a decade or more ago now seems to have shifted to developing distributed representations. LLMs use word tokens (for words or the entities in images). But there are many more. The 3D Fields (or whatever they have evolved to) developed by Fei-Fei Li's group represent visual information in a way better suited for geometrical tasks. Wav2Vec, the convolutional features for YOLO and friends, and these sentence representations are other examples. I would love to read a review of this circle of ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42563534</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Software Design is Knowledge Building" discusses the importance of software design as a means to foster knowledge creation within teams and organizations. It emphasizes that effective software design goes beyond coding and technical skills, highlighting the need for collaboration, shared understanding, and continuous learning among developers. The author advocates for iterative design processes and the value of documenting and reflecting on design decisions as a way to enhance collective expertise. Ultimately, the piece underscores that good software design contributes to team cohesion and the overall success of projects by facilitating deeper insights into both the technology and domain it serves.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've handed off a few services I built with minimal oversight or documentation. The receiving teams have been able to make changes without my involvement and everyone is happy.I believe the only reason I've been successful in this is because I agonize over simplicity. There are times during the development of any project where one might be tempted to hack around an issue, or commit the ugly code that seems to work. These are the rough edges that inheritors of a codebase use as evidence that a blank slate would be preferable. They're also the bits where the underlying business logic becomes murky. My goal is for the code to be so clear that documentation would feel redundant.This approach of course takes more time and requires that your management trusts you and is willing to compromise on timelines. It's extremely rewarding if you can sell it and deliver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a well-referenced essay, drawing the on writing of David Parnas [1], Peter Naur [2], and Zach Tellman [3].As software developers we’re intimately familiar with these ideas. But the industry still treats it as “folk knowledge”, despite decades of academic work and systemization attempts like the original Agile.We really need more connective work, relating the theoretical ideas to the observed behavior of real-life software projects, and to the subsequent damage and dysfunction. I liked this essay because it scratches that itch for me. But we need this work to go beyond personal blogs/newsletters/dev.to articles. It needs to be recognized &amp; accepted as formal “scientific” knowledge, and to be seen and grokked by industry and corporate leadership.[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/257734.257788[2] https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf[3] https://explaining.software/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of our white collar jobs are about knowledge sharing and synchronization between people.And surprisingly this is an aspect in which I see very very little progress.The most we have are tools like confluence or Jira that are actually quite bad in my opinion.The bad part is how knowledge is shared. At the moment is just formatted text with a questionable search.LLMs I believe can help in synthesize what knowledge is there and what is missing.Moreover it would be possible to ask what is missing or what could be improved. And it would be possible to continuously test the knowledge base, asking the model question about the topic and checking the answer.I am working on a prototype and it is looking great. If someone is interested, please let me know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557255</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that most people are underestimating Nvidia strategy.Their bet is that AI will unlock robotics use and they don't want to be simply compute providers, they want to innovate on the whole chain, software, hardware, services, everything.Their position is quite unique as their R&amp;D is basically financed by their future competitors, they are making bank while going where the puck will be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the new breakthrough in robotics that is gpu driven ? There are subsets of the overall problem that can be solved by a gpu (eg object detection) but the whole planning and control algo scheme seems to be more or less the same as it has been for the past decades. These typically involve non-convex optimization so not much gpu benefit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/uKeHc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548077</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article highlights the key features and improvements introduced in Ruby 3.4, focusing on enhancements in performance, syntax, and functionality. It discusses new language features, updates to existing methods, and the overall goals of the Ruby community in improving developer productivity and code efficiency.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pleasantly surprised to see this improvement:  Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) removes the created temporary file
  immediately. So applications don’t need to remove the file.
  [Feature #20497]

I use a similar pattern a lot:  file = Tempfile.new.tap(&amp;:unlink)
  file &lt;&lt; "... some really large data to pipe"
  system("md5sum", in: file.tap(&amp;:rewind))

It's a neat trick to leverage the filesystem for large amounts of data (e.g. "psql \copy" generation), without littering tempfiles everywhere. Once the last fd disappears, the filesystem releases the data; so you don't have to "trap" signals and add cleanup routines. (Hint: you can also use these unlinked-tempfiles for command output, e.g. huge grep output, etc.)On Linux systems, `open(..., O_TMPFILE)` is typically used, which provides additional safety. The created file is initially unnamed (no race condition between `open` and `unlink`).When I needed safety, my non-portable solution was to use Ruby's syscall feature. (Btw, I love that you can do this.)  require "fcntl"

  SYS_OPEN   = 2
  O_TMPFILE  = 0x00410000
  O_RDWR     = Fcntl::O_RDWR

  def tmpfile
    mode = O_RDWR | O_TMPFILE
    fd = syscall(SYS_OPEN, "/dev/shm", mode, 0644)
    IO.for_fd(fd)
  end

But... Another pleasant surprise from the PR (https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20497).  Linux 3.11 has O_TMPFILE to create an unnamed file.
  The current implementation uses it.

Excellent to see :)
Makes the PR even better!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know Shopify has a great site on comparing Ruby vs YJIT perf.https://speed.yjit.orgBut does anyone have current numbers on how Ruby/YJIT compares to something like Python/PHP/LuaJIT?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The default block parameter name seems small, but I feel like I'm gonna use it all the time, especially when I'm in the Rails console just trying to debug data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42566141</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Blue Origin has successfully conducted a hot-fire test of its New Glenn rocket, an important milestone that sets the company up for an anticipated launch early next year. This marks a significant step in the development of the heavy-lift vehicle, which is designed to compete in the commercial launch market. The hot-fire test involved the rocket's BE-4 engines and is part of the company's ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability and performance of New Glenn, which is expected to carry payloads for a variety of missions, including satellite launches and orbital delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much data do you guys reckon they gather during this 24-second window? Gigabytes? Terabytes? I imagine they have redundant sensors for every measurement, if possible. The LHC generates 1 PB/s, though it filters it down to roughly 200MB/s[0]. I wonder how this compares.0: https://www.lhc-closer.es/taking_a_closer_look_at_lhc/0.lhc_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're at 12 years of design and 5 years behind the originally announced first launch of 2020 now. Space is hard, rocketry is harder and I wish them luck, but Blue Origin has an awfully long way to go if they want to catch up to SpaceX: this was meant to be the Falcon 9 killer, but odds are Starship will be fully operational before New Glenn completes testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blue Origin is a funny company.  I worked for TerraBella/SkySat/Google Satellite, Planet Labs and Kubos, each as a consultant/contractor/whatever.  I struck up a conversation w/ Rob Meyerson @ a conference and told him what I was working on (mostly comms / ground station work, but with a tiny bit of GNC test infrastructure.)  I mean, I'm not God's gift to rocket scientists, but...  I was pretty heavily recruited by them but was working at Amazon and didn't want to leave, then spent some time nursing a family member through cancer treatments.  Finally I'm ready to talk to them and I start with back-channel chats to make sure they still have open reqs.  They do so I informally talk about specific things I've done and what I might do at BO.  Finally I put my resume together and submit it to the hiring manager I had been talking about, emphasizing the bits he said he was interested in.  15 minutes later I'm rejected for the position they had been recruiting me for.I mean... I'm not a SUPER rocket engineer, but I'm pretty solid for the things I did work on.  I've slogged through design meetings where I had to analyze protocol specs and make sure we agree'd on details, wrote code, wrote A LOT of tests.  I mean, I'm solid.  The only thing I can think is I don't have a Ph.D., but that DEFINITELY wasn't a requirement when Bob was running the shop.Folk have told me it's evolved into something much more like Amazon where each team optimizes it's tiny bit and teams communicate only via APIs and the only opportunity you get to optimize complete functional or value chains is when something breaks.Just seems a bit weird they went from "we're 10 guys in a hangar" to "we've re-implemented Amazon's small-team/local optimization religion" in less than 10 years and with less than 1/30-th of the number of engineers.I wish them the best.  I think SpaceX really needs some decent competition to focus their collective minds.  But... they've gone weird.I'm probably too senior and too "weird" to them to get hired there, but I absolutely encourage young engineers interested in an intense experience to check out their jobs page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534555</guid></item><item><title>18.

But the repo[2] has been archived and there is an active FSM library from the same developer called robot[3].[0]: https://xstate.js.org/[1]: https://astro.build/[2]: https://github.com/lucydsl/liblucy[3]: https://github.com/matthewp/robot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I don't like about these state machine DSLs is that they are not really composable at the "machine level". It is a known fact that FSM are equivalent to regular expressions [1]    Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognised by a finite automaton. The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known as Kleene's theorem

I think a cool state machine language would use this fact as a starting point for it's syntax. Another very useful feature would be "functions" to isolate specific repetitive parts of FSM[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quite like the concise state machine definitions used in Rodney Brooks' "A Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot"[0]. The first element is the state name, and whatever is returned is the next state.  (defmodule avoid
    :inputs (force heading)
    :outputs (command)
    :instance-vars (resultforce)
    :states ((nil (event-dispatch (and force heading) plan))

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with all the very impressive videos on that page is that we have no idea how many attempts were made before the robot could successfully, e.g. "put strawberry into the correct bowl". In that task there's four bowls, so a random choice of bowl would be correct 25% of the time. How many times did the robot put the strawberry e.g. in the bowl of apples? And that's assuming "the correct bowl" is the one with the strawberries (which is a big assumption- the strawberry should go with the others of its kind: says who? How often can the robot put the strawberry in the bowl with the apples if that's what we want it to do?).Plotted results show around 50% average performance on "unseen" tasks, environments, objects etc, which sounds a lot like success follows some kind of random distribution. That's not a great way to engender trust in the "emergent" abilities of a robotic system to generalise to unseen tasks etc. Blame bad statistics if you get a strawberry in the eye, or a banana in the ear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[2023]Some of the authors have gone on to found a startup called Physical Intelligence: https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We represent the robot actions as text strings as shown below. An example of such a string could be a sequence of robot action token numbers: “1 128 91 241 5 101 127 217”.Training with numbers like this might be a little problematic, I have tried to fine tune GPT 4o-mini with very little success(just me?)On the other hand I found[1] Gemini and Molmo being able to locate elements on screen much better than 4o.1. https://github.com/BandarLabs/clickclickclick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565638</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While playing solitaire to while away the time during rest, Ulam asked himself a straightforward question: what are the chances that a hand laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? It is a deceptively challenging problem—there are around 8 × 10^67 ways to sort a deck of cards (a number approaching the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe). He wondered if instead of applying pure combinatorial calculations, which would be monstrously difficult, he could simply lay out the cards one hundred times and count the number of successful plays. Implicit was the assumption that each play started with randomized conditions.Indeed, the best “results”, to this day, are still approximations based on brute-forcing a huge number of deals (aka, using Monte-Carlo.)“The probability of being able to win a game of Klondike [Solitaire] with best-possible play is not known, and the inability of theoreticians to precisely calculate these odds has been referred to by mathematician Persi Diaconis as "one of the embarrassments of applied probability"” — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)#Probabili...“Here we show that a single general purpose Artificial Intelligence program, called “Solvitaire”, can be used to determine the winnability percentage of 45 different single-player card games with a 95% confidence interval of ± 0.1% or better. For example, we report the winnability of Klondike as 81.956% ± 0.096%” — https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.12314v3 (2019)More on HN here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42372083&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always completely forget that the metropolis-hastings algorithm is named after someone whose last name is actually Metropolis.It never ceases to amaze me what an environment Los Alamos was for producing so much foundational research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently going through the Statistical Rethinking [0] class on Bayesian statistics, and it reminded me that Bayesian statistics' renaissance was basically thanks to Monte Carlo methods.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did not know about the Marrakesh VIP Treaty &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh_VIP_Treaty&gt;, very cool:&gt;The treaty allows for copyright exceptions to facilitate the creation of accessible versions of books and other copyrighted works for visually impaired persons. It sets a norm for countries ratifying the treaty to have a domestic copyright exception covering these activities and allowing for the import and export of such materials.It's been in force since 2016, the US joined over five years.  I can't comment on the overall success, but seems like a rare gem, being a copyright law/treaty, international or otherwise, that is unabashedly good!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an aspect of something which I wish would be more acknowledged and investigated:&gt;How can the electronic representation of books be made more rich and featureful?Some notable examples:- https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.htm...- https://www.motionmountain.net/- The Elements by Theodore Gray https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-by-theodore-gray/...- the "Living Books" series: https://wanderfulstorybooks.com/Unfortunately vanished (anyone have an archive? was the wonderful _Bembo's Zoo_ https://www.devicq.com/bembo-zoo/ and https://engagetheirminds.com/2012/04/05/bembos-zoo/I'd be very glad of other examples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice.I note that in some ways the pictures really contribute to the story.  For example, see the story on Eeyore's tail missing.  The clue is that the picture shows the tail hanging as a cord to ring the doorbell.   The alt text conveys this nicely by saying:In this drawing, Pooh is back outside Owl's front door, with Owl standing in the doorway. Pooh is looking at the bell-rope, which ends in a tuft of hair.I'm not sure if this could truly be automated, as the description of the picture needs to fit the context of the story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565513</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent advancements in understanding the human microbiome and its significant impact on health and disease. It highlights how gut bacteria can influence various biological processes, including metabolism and immune responses, and underscores the potential for personalized medicine approaches that consider an individual’s microbiome profile. The article also emphasizes ongoing research aimed at harnessing microbial therapies to improve health outcomes and the challenges that remain in fully deciphering the complex interactions between microbiota and the human body.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There isn't much about accuracy:"Ithaca restored artificially produced gaps in ancient texts with 62% accuracy, compared with 25% for human experts. But experts aided by Ithaca’s suggestions had the best results of all, filling gaps with an accuracy of 72%. Ithaca also identified the geographical origins of inscriptions with 71% accuracy, and dated them to within 30 years of accepted estimates."and"[Using] an RNN to restore missing text from a series of 1,100 Mycenaean tablets ... written in a script called Linear B in the second millennium bc. In tests with artificially produced gaps, the model’s top ten predictions included the correct answer 72% of the time, and in real-world cases it often matched the suggestions of human specialists."Obviously 62%, 72%, 72% in ten tries, etc. is not sufficient by itself. How do scholars use these tools? Without some external source to verify the truth, you can't know if the software output is accurate. And if you have some reliable external source, you don't need the software.Obviously, they've thought of that, and it's worth experimenting with these powerful tools. But I wonder how they've solved that problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The full title is "How AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history", and that second part is especially fitting, although unfortunately not mentioned in the article itself, which is full of rather horrifying stories about using AI to "fill in" missing data, which is clearly not true data recovery in any meaningful sense.I am aware of how advanced algorithms such as those used for flash memory today can "recover" data from imperfect probability distributions naturally created by NAND flash operation, but there seems to a huge gap between those, which are based on well-understood information-theoretic principles, and the AI techniques described here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find this incredibly exciting. There could be some truly remarkable works whose contents are about to be revealed, and we don’t really know what we might find. Histories of the ancient (more ancient) world. Accounts of contact with cultures and civilizations that are currently lost to history. Scientific and mathematical discoveries. And what I often find to be the most moving: stories of daily life that illuminate what regular people thought and felt and experienced thousands of years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549123</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the UK, the financial year ends on 5 April. This is Lady Day (25 March) plus the 11 days lost in the transition from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Exodus 12:1-2, at the beginning of the section that decrees Passover, God also tells Moses and Aaron that the month of Passover is the first month of the year:  The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, "This month is
  to be for you the first month, the first month of your
  year. ..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A decent case can be made for March 1 as the start of the year. With March 1 as the start of the year the extra day in leap years then comes on the last day of the year. This makes dealing with leap years when calculating the day of the week from a date simpler.It also makes the names of September, October, November, and December make sense. Those names come from the Roman words for 7, 8, 9, and 10, which were the numbers of those months in the old Roman calendar which did start the year on March 1. The Romans switch the start to January sometime around 700 BCE giving us the current ridiculous situation where those months are two months later in the year than their names suggest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42568805</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do a switcharoo, I develop for iOS inside a macOS VM with Linux host.After a 5 years hiatus I started developing mobile apps again and I was frustrated to learn that Apple doesn't allow renewing the developer license on web anymore, I don't own a Mac  and even Apple developer app on iPhone didn't allow me to renew my license.After I signed into a macOS VM, I was able to renew my license through Apple Developer App on iPhone as macOS version of the app requires T2 chip.Now I have PTSD flashbacks of why I left mobile development in first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can use pbcopy/pbpaste in a Linux VM on Mac by making a shell script wrapper in the VM that calls “ssh mac-host pb{copy|paste}” - that is, basically ssh back from the guest to the host to use its clipboard. It’s seamless and fast since it’s basically a local network connection.My specific setup is that I use an authorized_keys entry on the host that restricts the guest to running a specific command, which limits what a compromised guest can do to the host. The command is set to a script that has a list of specific permitted actions. This is a good option if you’re looking for a bit of additional isolation between host and guest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run my entire work computer inside of a VM. I work from home and have a powerfull desktop i use for my private stuff hooked up to my 3 monitors. My work pc is a vmware vm running inside of vmware pro. I can minimize the work vm and work it out my sight or I can selective choose that the vm should use 1, 2 or 3 monitors and it is easy to switch back and forth between work and private without have any work related data on my private desktop. The work vm is domain joined, o365 enterprise joined and loocked down in ridicilous ways by cooperate IT but now i can run that from my private powerfull PC without worring that corp IT messes up my private computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42541508</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a second as a unit of time measurement, explaining its historical evolution from ancient methods based on celestial observations to its current definition based on atomic time. It details how the second is defined in terms of the vibrations of cesium atoms, highlighting the precision and scientific advancements that led to this standardization. The piece also addresses the implications of this definition for both practical purposes and philosophical inquiries about the nature of time itself.&lt;/p&gt;

(johndcook.com)An Unreasonable Amount of Time (allenpike.com)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A funny consequence of this is that there are people alive today that do not know (and never will know) their exact age in seconds[1].This is true even if we assume the time on the birth certificate was a time precise down to the second. It is because what was considered the length of a second during part of their life varied significantly compared to what we (usually) consider a second now.[1] Second as defined in the article as 9192631770/s being the the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Incidentally, “cesium” is the American English spelling of the name of atomic element 55, and “caesium” is the IUPAC spelling.I'm so glad we settled on common notations (drived from Brahmi script) to represent numbers. On one end, we humans chase precision with math. On the other end we humans can't even agree on spellings in the same language spoken in different continents. I wonder if spelling differences has resulted in any critical failures such as the metrics conversion error in NASA Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999

Maybe sedutil from OPAL?

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the limitations and insights offered by statistics in understanding human behavior and societal trends. It discusses how statistical data can provide a framework for interpreting complex phenomena but also emphasizes that numbers can be misleading or misinterpreted. By examining real-world examples, the author illustrates the importance of context, the potential pitfalls of reductionism, and the need for a nuanced approach to data analysis. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a balanced view of statistics as both a powerful tool and a construct that requires careful application to truly reflect human experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't pretend to know anything about HP calc hacking (did a little TI BASIC for fun, that's not even remotely similar). But doesn't this come up in all kinds of daily situations, graphical or otherwise? You only recalculate and update the parts that may have changed. I assume this is similar to why Zelda on my original black and gray GameBoy as a 90s kid was arranged into scenes with few moving elements, so it didn't have to recalculate rendering for the entire screen during action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never wrote code for the hp48-gx, but I remember that some games written in assembly looked like Game Boy games. The screen even had shades of gray by writing once every 4, 8, ... loop. I don't have the details but it was pretty convincing. Some source code would help in that case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flashback to lurking around comp.sys.hp48 looking for downloads.https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.hp48/c/BS7c8hRAau0/m/P5...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557019</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once made a large pencil drawing of my living room using only words.Each word depicted a "thing" at the position I found it.  It taught me a lot about what things are.  A chair is obviously a separate entity and easy to list, but what about the floor and the separate floorboards?  I listed the wall, but I didn't list the paint on the wall.The bookcase took a lot of effort, because I found that each book in it was a thing by itself and should get listed separately.  However, when I was nearly finished, I found a bag in a cabinet, holding ~200 pins.  I just counted them and noted down "207 pins"; I didn't feel that each pin was unique enough to warrant separate entries.I now try to stop believing in things.  It's mostly just molecules that happen to be in a certain configuration for some time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some constructive feedback to the site owner: Instead of having the webpage spend several minutes slowly loading thousands of barely-compressed 500x500 JPG images, please consider this advice:1. Convert the images to WEBP or AVIF or at least run them through something like TinyPNG to compress them better.2. Save two versions of each images; a 75x75 version that gets used for the 75px thumbnails shown on the page, and a 500x500 version that appears in the lightbox after a thumbnail is clicked.3. Only load a few dozen thumbnails at first and then load more after the user scrolls down or clicks a "show more" type button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oof, just loading this page caused my browser to download 170 MB of content.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of respect for books in India is ridiculous. Very few use libraries, and forget temperature/humidity control: most feel no shame in mishandling books they borrow. The availability and care shown to books, new and old, in the US is very commendable.Our prime minister and most citizens love to brag about "ancient culture" and "proud history", but preservation of our own history and public record was and is done much better by the British and Americans. It's truly nauseating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always argued that antiquated books, sculptures and paintings should not be repatriated back to India due to lack of preservation ecosystem and culture. Just look at the historic sites (barring a very few popular ones), they are either literally pissed on upon or become a poster board for election campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Books are printed in quantities of more than one. I concede a fair amount of material might be the last copy extant, but isn't there an element of post-hoc rationalisation this impoverished stocks of Indian books?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548390</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significant disruptions experienced on the Elizabeth Line during a two-day breakdown, detailing the causes and impacts of the signaling failures that led to service cancellations and delays. It explores the technical issues faced by Transport for London, the response to the chaos, and how this incident reflects on the management of the new railway line. The breakdown affected many passengers and raised concerns about the reliability of the service shortly after its launch, highlighting the complexities of modern rail signaling systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's very little information in either this post or elsewhere on the internets.This discussion on a UK rail forum provides some food for thought [1]The Elizabeth line is pioneering in terms of aiming for automated train operation (ATO) over infrastructure that's shared to some extent with trains driven by humans. Going beyond driving per se, both types of trains make use of highly complex automation for functions like switch management, traffic separation for safety and station door opening.Reading through the lines, two systemic difficulties this brings about are:(A) A conceptually new ATO system (Siemens Trainguard MT); a further plot twist is that Siemens acquired the system mid-development from Invensys.(B) Ad-hoc integration of this system with a large number of external systems provided by several vendors; it should be of note that rail systems are not designed for to interoperability with other vendors, and integration is often achieved post-development bringing about otherwise avoidable complexity.Given that during the incident each individual domain of the system (A) has been reset and validated multiple times, my suspicion falls on the undocumented and uncharted complexity underlying (B).[1] https://www.railforums.co.uk/threads/elizabeth-line-total-lo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incidentally GSM-R problems led to a nationwide train service shutdown in Norway on December 25.

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "The Psychonaut Field Manual" serves as a comprehensive guide for individuals exploring altered states of consciousness through various means, including psychedelics and meditation. It covers topics such as preparation for journeys, safety protocols, the nature of consciousness, and techniques for navigating experiences. The manual emphasizes the importance of personal growth and understanding oneself through these explorations, while also providing practical advice on integrating experiences afterward. It aims to equip readers with the knowledge and tools necessary for safe and insightful psychonautic practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think when people read things like this they overly focus on the hocus pocus part of it rather than something that is probably or even definitely true with human beings - that there is a certain power to belief. I’ve had treatment resistant PTSD and depression most of my life and inevitably stuff like meditation/spirituality comes up, which I had always felt was a desperate last resort, and although I am agnostic, I am extremely materialist and find much of it dumb/silly. I started however reading textbooks about tantric yoga and their claims, while some of it is indeed weird or silly, there is definitely something to some of it - particularly tibetan yoga practitioners being able to withstand extreme heat, cold, or endurance for long periods of time with no seeming explanation. I had discovered my ability a long time ago to control pain levels and my perception of hot/cold, but they seem to be doing something that is actually controlling internal body functions, and that got my imagination going about how one could use that to treat things like PTSD.I have had some success. a lot of it is visualizing and “believing” any way you possibly can, I think much of the ritual in stuff like this is to get you into whatever state is needed to trick your body or mind into doing something, at least that’s how I think it “works.” The author seems kind of aware of this and it seems to borrow many similar concepts as the stuff I’ve read, but with much more occultish ritual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just read the whole 44 pages and some years ago I spent a day or two delving into Crowley’s work. (I was curious but never had the time or need to practice any of the teachings)There’s a spooky coherence in the descriptions and that’s what makes it such a fascinating read. The spin that this work puts on the subject - calling this “technology” and likening it to programming adds to this.To anyone honestly wanting to take this for a spin, I recommend reading the biography of Aleister Crowley first. It’s an interesting read in itself and it also illustrates the risks/dangers. Pictures speak a thousand words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The classic, train your mind to believe anything you want, use it to improve your life, try believing some really cooky stuff, woah you actually believe it, no shit, you descend into crazier and crazier stuff.I’m currently leaning towards believing that learning intense focus through meditation + setting intentions for yourself in that state is genuinely useful, just like rituals are (saying “yes” to your partner in front of friends and family it changes you). But the border between it and “I’m a trans dimensional shaman in psychiatric A&amp;E” is a bit to thin for my liking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42563946</guid></item><item><title>40.

It is not actually about the long and painful history of time.  In fact, it barely touches on history at all.3.  Some of the things it says are flat-out wrong.  For example, "How long does it take the earth to face the Sun at the same angle? This simple question has a definite and fairly simple scientific answer..."  No, it doesn't.  It's not even a constant.https://explainingscience.org/2015/08/24/september-18-the-sh...4.  This is the only work the author ever published (he died in 2009).So... if you read this and wondered why anyone should care, your puzzlement is well-founded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1972 the leap second was created.This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time and place are inseparable, and a lot of confusion about time can be resolved by being more specific about one’s position and velocity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548914</guid></item><item><title>42.

Congrats on your promotion, but your title ultimately means little across companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in the Marines, I was promoted to Lance Corporal twice (and wasn't demoted between the two promotions.)  The unit I was in just wasn't that great with Admin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That means your manager has to be switched on and fully on board.Your manager also needs enough political capital to drive the promotion. This is something I have an acute awareness of, having been told for the last 3 years that I was operating at the principal level (no staff title here) but not getting promoted. Eventually my manager was forced out of the company by bullying from my skip-level, so now I'm left to look for a new role elsewhere or spend some unknown amount of time building the relationship with my new manager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549029</guid></item><item><title>43.

Adding paths one at a time to a massive union is slow.This seem like more of a surprise to the author than it was for me.I’d say the takeaway is that treating everything like a black box doesn’t produce good results (sometimes). And not knowing enough to open the box completely leaves you with a lot of unknowns, surprises, and loose ends. But hey, figuring this stuff out is why we get paid the $$$.Sometimes it would help to read a book or consult someone more knowledgeable though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42541885</guid></item><item><title>44.

The next time something bad comes round, we're just going to have it wash over us and Black Death it. It's a shame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how people's immune systems can get synced to the first flu they encounter. Coincidentally, the latest issue of Science has a paper finding that genetics is a more important factor than first exposure in determining which flu strain a person's immune system can fight best.https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2396&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see this mentioned in the article (or maybe I missed it), but what are the chances that it's already been circulating in the population (h2h) but causing very mild symptoms? It doesn't seem like we're testing for it unless a patient becomes hospitalized (and apparently even then it might take several ER trips before they decide to test). Are we relying on waste-water testing to determine community transmission then?I have a friend here in Oregon that came down with conjunctivitis for several days and then progressed to flu symptoms. It didn't hit him hard though and he recovered on his own just fine. I'm sure many pathogens can produce this same symptom progression, but it elevated my curiosity for sure.I see that Canadian teen who acquired H5N1 had a similar symptom progression and initially tested positive for flu strain A, but it wasn't until they did further testing specifically for H5N1 that it was discovered. I suspect these "last-resort" testing scenarios are quite common since most hospitals (particularly in the US) don't give enough of a damn to test further for cases that don't require over-night+ admission into the hospital or ICU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42567069</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used a Framework 13" as my daily driver for 3 years. I still have it, and now I also have a Framework 16", which has been my daily driver for the last six months.The user serviceability and upgrade stories are real. The hardware isn't as svelte as Apple's, but mine has traveled all over the world and has yet to have any major issues. The one hardware failure I had was that the USB-C half of the charging cable on my 13" eventually broke after a few years of abuse, but that used to happen to me with Apple charging cables, too.Framework has an active initiative to do outreach to different Linux distro communities and give them free hardware to help shore up compatibility. And, on that note, I haven't run into any Linux hardware compatibility issues (not with Pop!_OS, or more recently NixOS).Speaking for myself, they have a loyal customer for as long as they continue to make this kind of hardware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bought a Framework 13" in 2022 (Intel 13th gen). It's equipped with 32GB ram and a 1TB drive.It has good intentions but falls short. I would say overall it is a mediocre laptop in terms of quality.Will it last longer than any other laptop? I would think so, it has a strong story of available parts and upgrades. Similarly I believe it would last longer than any other laptop, since you can essentially do a Ship of Theseus with it.Pain points:  - display hinge problem, picking up the laptop would make the screen lie flat 180 degrees, which is really annoying - this has been fixed in newer versions of framework, but to get a new hinge kit costs $39 AUD plus $30 AUD in shipping, so I'm not willing to make that purchase due to the ridiculous shipping price.

  - the modular ports are nice, but I'd rather just have fixed ports and more of them, of course that'd obstruct the repair/modularity story.

  - sometimes the modular ports do not work after resuming from a hibernate, I have to eject and reseat it.

  - the display is okay, I notice mine has a small granular line of off coloured pixels - i don't think this is due to any physical damage but rather a defect in the screen as I've never had this kind of issue with any other laptop and I've handled the framework fairly carefully; but this line of off coloured pixels is very faint and virtually unnoticeable at bright colours, so it's not a huge deal as I make it out to be.

  - the keyboard works great, but I was hoping for an upgrade to something along the lines of an apple style layout with half height inverted-t arrow keys and fn/ctrl swapped; the idea of a marketplace for custom parts doesn't seem to really exist.

  - Battery life of about 3-4 hours of very average usage.

  - Speakers are trash.

The webcam / mic are good enough.I run Linux on it, and seems to run pretty stable.I needed this laptop because I needed 32GB of ram for compile jobs. I have since got a macbook pro 16" with &gt;32GB of ram and it can compile what I need using Rosetta 2 for Linux (so amd64 compiles). Since my mac can now do everything I need, I very rarely touch my Framework. I loathe the idea of having to use it over a mac laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of contributing to more electronic waste and as an economic purchase, I...use used ThinkPads.Advantages:Zero new electronic waste created.Several 'new' machines are cheaper than a Framework.Small upgrades plentiful and cheap. A major upgrade of a'new' machine still cheaper and more environmentally friendly than a Framework.Better battery life, keyboard, ergonomic design, ports, hinges LOL, etc.Try one today: ebay.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564216</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of a spiral linked list in the C programming language, demonstrating how to create and manipulate this data structure. It provides a detailed explanation of the concept, along with sample code and illustrative diagrams to help users understand the structure and its operations. The content is intended for programmers looking to enhance their knowledge of linked lists by exploring this specific variation and its applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The spiral rule works only if there is no pointer to pointer or array of array in the type. In other words it is an incorrect rule. But take this for example:        +----------------------------+
        | +-----------------------+  |
        | | +------------------+  |  |
        | | | +-------------+  |  |  |
        | | | | +--------+  |  |  |  |
        | | | | |  +--+  |  |  |  |  |
        | | | | |  ^  |  |  |  |  |  |
    int * * ¦ ¦ ¦ VAR[1][2][3] |  |  |
     ^  | | | | |     |  |  |  |  |  |
     |  | | | | +-----+  |  |  |  |  |
     |  | | | +----------+  |  |  |  |
     |  | | +---------------+  |  |  |
     |  | ---------------------+  |  |
     |  +-------------------------+  |
     +-------------------------------+

The type of VAR is a [1-element] array of [2-element] array of [3-element] array of pointer to pointer to ints. I drew a spiral that passes through each specifier in the correct order. To make the spiral correct it has to skip the pointer specifiers in the first three loops. This is marked by ¦.The Right-Left Rule is quoted less frequently on HN but it's a correct algorithm for deciphering C types: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/rt_lt.rule.htmlThe spiral rule can be modified to process all array specifiers before all pointer specifiers, but then you'd have to specify that the order to do so is right and then left. At that point it's just the Right-Left Rule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a C programmer, declarations in Go appeared "backwards" to me when I first saw them.IMO the Go syntax is a vast improvement as it's much simpler and avoids the clockwise/spiral issue: https://appliedgo.com/blog/go-declaration-syntax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The proper way is to use /usr/bin/cdecl or https://cdecl.org and extract as many typedefs as reasonable from the gibberish, because in C most of the times you’ll need these anyway to address lifetimes and ownership/borrowing points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564861</guid></item><item><title>47. 40+ JackOfManyTrades needs advice for job search</title><link>item?id=42548572</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find that people get weird when interviewing those with more experience. Managers tend to be okay because they've accepted that they're not the specialists, but when you get a tech lead with 9y exp interviewing someone with 15y exp, it's weirder. Some put you on a pedestal, some get insecure and treat you like some dragon to be slain.Lots of people are T-shaped engineers, so they tend to interview in their domain of expertise and disregard someone else's T-shaped skill. Like you could be an amazing TDD implementer with an efficient code base, and then someone will grill you on how many bugs tests actually catch and bring up the myth of zero defect. Then they fight the candidate on home ground and ask questions on implementing encryption, because that's the Blub they know.This goes on and they have "trouble finding talent" until they finally find someone who has a very similar skill overlap to the interviewer. The team ends up T-shaped, when it should be square shaped, with different people making up for the weakness in these teams. In this economy, companies can be pickier, so the problem is worse.Your T-shaped experience is very much an advantage. I don't have a solution for this, other than making it clear what you're bringing to the team. Finding a job through a network might be one solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My bona fides: I am old and have done it all. I will now tell you how it worked out.Like you, I am a person who can do pretty much anything. I had nothing but success. Jobs came to me. Then, at around 45, the company I worked for went down and I found myself unemployed.Like you, my resume was unusual. I broke it into skill groups. It was obvious that I had a lot of accomplishments and, if hired, could help with almost any need. Nobody hired me.I did freelance work, started a company that didn’t work. Eventually needed a job again. Kept looking.Finally, I ran into a headhunter who told me the magic: Decide what you want to do and remove everything from your resume that does not apply to that specific topic. Do not allow even a hint of general-purpose skill to appear.She made me understand that nobody had a requisition for a ‘jack of all trades’. They have a requisition for a sales agent, bookkeeper, programmer, database guy. Specific stuff.I was broke and did what she said.In my case, my education and fundamental skill was programming. Gone were all of my proud accomplishments in favor of all the things I knew about PHP, MYSQL, LAMP of all sorts (this was in the ought). Also some things where I had helped a project team. It made me sad because I have done some very cool stuff that went by the wayside. But it was the resume of a professional programmer, dedicated to the craft.I have never been unemployed since.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work for myself, so I don't interview for jobs, but I do interview for projects or interim positions.Being a generalist myself, my CV is also all over the place. I tailor my 'CV' to the company/project I'm interviewing for, so it appears less confusing. I have several versions where different skills and projects are highlighted, downplayed or even removed. I also write a tailored text for the position or project, making it explicitly clear why I would be a good fit, to make sure the person views me the way I want to be viewed. I try to ensure that my CV leaves no room for their personal interpretation. (many are often skeptical of a broad skillset, or lack the experience to properly value it)That said, it could also be the current economy that works against you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548572</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits of storing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes within a password manager. It argues that using a password manager for this purpose can enhance security and convenience, as it allows users to keep all their credentials—both passwords and 2FA codes—organized and accessible in one place. The author emphasizes that while there are risks associated with this approach, such as potential vulnerabilities in password managers, the security features they offer can mitigate those risks. Ultimately, the piece advocates for the streamlined management of 2FA codes through password managers for improved user experience and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42567279"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are better off security-wise with 2FA enabled than without it (for the phishing-related reasons mentioned in TFA - EDIT: taviso is correct in their comment, it's more about protection against credential stuffing than phishing), regardless of where you put the codes, so if being able to put the codes in your password manager is going to be the difference-maker in someone electing to use 2FA, they should do it.It's the same idea with using a password manager in the first place - if a password manager is going to be the thing that gets you to use secure passwords that vary across services, it's worth the tradeoff of having all of those passwords in one place, because you're much more likely to be compromised by a bad password than by a password manager leak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason I store 2FA codes in my password manager is as a protest to companies forcing me to have a 2FA. I don't want to be randomly locked out of my google account due to not having a usable 2FA, and I also don't want to depend on having a single device be always available to provide the codes.In practice, I feel the main reason 2FA is popular is because people cannot be trusted to create unique and secure passwords for every service. The phishing-resistance is nice, but I'd prefer it being the only credential, and just having it be autofilled (making it longer to combat bruteforce), like what we currently have with password managers...Here's to hoping passkeys turn out any better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I store 2FA keys in a fingerprint protected Aegis vault on my phone, and I periodically export an encrypted (with a master password I remember) backup that I then email to my parents.I get their argument that 2FA makes phishing more difficult, but I disagree that it's its "primary use", or that the distributed factor is unimportant. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable having all my important accounts behind Bitwarden's single point of failure. 2FA for important accounts mitigates the damage if my Bitwarden is broken into.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42567279</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Sandia National Laboratories' advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) cooling techniques, highlighting innovative methods to manage the heat generated by powerful computing systems. It emphasizes the importance of effective cooling solutions to enhance computing performance and energy efficiency, as well as to reduce operational costs. The research focuses on developing technologies that can sustain and improve the performance of next-generation supercomputers while addressing environmental concerns and energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;None of this is particularly new. Horizontal submerging has been an area of research for at least 20 years. Spinny disks were a pain to do, because they need a certain amount of air to not have head crashes. (Sealed HDDs existed I'm sure. )The problem is that its not that practical. Firstly it much less dense than upright racks, secondly its almost certainly more heavy.What is happening now is direct watercooling to the rack. Currently in widespread use is effectively a back of rack "car" radiator (ie it looks like a rack sized car radiator), where the coolant is piped to the back of the rack.Another, newer, but needed for high density GPU, is coolant block direct to component cooling. Where you have a coolant manifold on the back of the rack with each server plumbed direct into the coolant loop.However, that doesn't solve the problem of what to do with the heat once you have it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article doesn't even mention the Cray-2 that used Flourinert for cooling.Flourinert turned out to be really bad for the environment, so I wonder if the article was meant to be how they have a new cooling fluid that is safer?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinert&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don‘t like how they mix up different ideas:1) having liquid instead of air as the first heat transporting medium
2) having water evaporation chillers instead of air heat exchangers and maybe heat pumps to chill the (last) heat transportation medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557142</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that while Next.js offers many powerful features for building React applications, it may not be necessary for all projects. It discusses alternatives and simpler approaches to building applications, emphasizing the importance of evaluating project requirements and considering the complexity of using Next.js. The piece encourages developers to choose the tools that best fit their needs, suggesting that often simpler solutions can be just as effective without the overhead associated with more complex frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know what the issue is? People are so focused on being able to scale their idea to billions of users before they even start building it. So someone today would start using Kubernetes for their website with 5 visitors. I've seen many students use Nextjs for websites that could easily be written with plain html + css, and some chart library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've built my latest project[1] with Next.js and it's often felt pretty hectic to use.App vs. pages router, accessing cookies requiring different APIs between the client-side and the server side, env vars being accessed via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` which gets rewritten into literal value of the env var (so if you access `process.env` directly you're very confused).I guess I was hoping that I'd be able to write code which would work on either the client-side or the server-side with minimal changes. But that's not what I experienced. For what Next.js does provide, it doesn't feel worth the overhead and the learning required to do it "the Next.js way".1 - https://onlyhumanhub.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so true! Our codebase got radically simpler when we did the exact same thing. And faster too, in terms of page rendering. It is very unfortunate that the whole community is being pushed onto frameworks like this unnecessarily.All most folks need is `npx rsbuild init`:https://rsbuild.dev/(And I love that the post authors are using rspack! I read the post after posting this comment. This was our exact same process. No more overhead of next -- just used rspack/rsbuilld and a simple router and beautiful simplicity everywhere, including 10ms hot reloads)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565502</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential benefits and challenges of the UK government considering a scheme to regulate online platforms, focusing on the balance between fostering innovation and protecting user rights. It emphasizes the need for careful regulation, outlining concerns about ensuring fair competition and preventing monopolistic practices while also supporting transparency and accountability in online services.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is correct in that media DRM is tied to GPU vendors on the field right now.But hardware backed DRM can be so much more invasive beyond that. I have no doubts the long term goal of MS is to have a Windows version of Play Integrity.[0] So total control over everything that happens on your device. Just to give an example of what could happen if this becomes reality: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Environment_IntegrityThis tech extended to browsers could easily mean that sites could refuse to serve you if your machine is running any bigcorp unapproved software. An easy example of that would be adblockers.Unless we get lucky with secure world compromises like the Tegra X1 bootrom exploit[1] or get real good at passing legistlation that forces companies to give you all the private keys to your own machine, the future for personal computing is looking grim.[0]: https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity[1]: https://github.com/fail0verflow/shofel2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DRM is a government sanctioned desecration, by corporations, of your private property rights, by its very definition.Whether it’s in the GPU, CPU, TPM, or any other part of computing property you ostensibly own, is an utterly irrelevant distraction, the root is the unholy alliance of government and capital power.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fully get the DRM hate.Now I don’t really follow the Windows world but I thought the goal of the newer TPM stuff was to be able to provide a trusted boot chain the way Apple does. I’m under the impression that some of the earlier versions allowed the TPM module to be a separate piece of hardware from the CPU and thus exposed an hardware attack path where someone could snoop or man in the middle.If you have a full trusted chain you can certainly use that to ensure that the DRM isn’t being tampered with. But I kind of doubt that’s the main reason behind all of it. There are enough good reasons they may want better security on the hardware outside of that it seems justifiable that they might push it.I’m not arguing it’s good or bad, I just don’t think it’s 100% about DRM and the rest is a smoke screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570988</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Zasper is an open-source project designed to enhance developer productivity by simplifying the process of building and managing APIs. It provides a flexible framework that allows users to easily create, test, and document their APIs, all while integrating with various authentication methods and third-party services. The project emphasizes ease of use, with comprehensive documentation and modular architecture, making it suitable for both new developers and experienced programmers looking to streamline their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am the author of Zasper.The unique feature of Zasper is that the Jupyter kernel handling is built with Go coroutines and is far superior to how it's done by JupyterLab in Python.Zasper uses one fourth of RAM and one fourth of CPU used by Jupterlab. While Jupyterlab uses around 104.8 MB of RAM and 0.8 CPUs, Zasper uses 26.7 MB of RAM and 0.2 CPUs.Other features like Search are slow because they are not refined.I am building it alone fulltime and this is just the first draft. Improvements will come for sure in the near future.I hope you liked the first draft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's probably an unrelated post (apologies in advance) but I wanted to shoutout to the Marimo (https://marimo.io), it's the only Jupyter alternative that really got me excited, it's like Streamlit and Jupyter had a kid (and the kid took the best genes from both).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s the advantage of this? It isn’t obvious to me that reducing memory usage and CPU of an empty/idle kernel is all that meaningful if the actual Python code in your notebook uses far more resources. It’s also not obvious to me how Go’s better threading helps, either, if all the computational bits are in Python anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42572057</guid></item><item><title>3. uBlock Origin GPL code being stolen by team behind honey browser extension</title><link>https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1hr6xjc/ubo_quick_filters_list_being_stolen_by_team/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The project "mitmproxy2swagger" is a tool that facilitates the conversion of API request and response data captured with mitmproxy into the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification format. This tool aims to streamline the documentation and design processes for APIs by automatically generating Swagger files from the traffic monitored through mitmproxy, thus saving developers time and effort in creating and maintaining API documentation. The repository provides installation instructions, usage examples, and guidelines for contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who used Revit for 5 years before moving to develop and maintain custom Revit API apps full-time, I have many horror stories I could share (feel free to AMA). I can say that the latest version of Revit (R2025) is largely a single-threaded application, and has only just upgraded their back-end from .Net Framework 4.8.1 to .Net8.0. The company continuously and openly takes breathtakingly blatant advantage of their user base and is at worst adversarial to their users. The software captures and exchanges a surprising amount of data during usage (to the point that Revit itself is hard to distinguish between malware by network cybersec software). Autodesk is a walking-talking timebomb of an antitrust suit waiting to happen. With that said, Revit does a lot of things well and there are no realistic alternatives. Personally, I have always found community responses on forums very helpful while autodesk support has ranged from helpful, to useless, to simultaneously counter-productive and insulting. Jeremy Tammik (officially affiliated with Autodesk these days) and his “The Building Coder Blog” is a very nice reference for Revit API and he is somehow EVERYWHERE on the forums.edit: the open letter posted here by another user does a very good job detailing many broad issues (with Revit in particular); every point it makes is accurate in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urgh, cultural vandalism.The challenge here is that there are people out there who just do not understand the inherent value of this kind of old content. If any company exists for long enough eventually some of those people will cycle into positions of decision-making authority where they get to "save costs" or "clean things up" by delete-hammering some invaluable artifact like this one.The correct way to handle this is to add a BIG banner on top of older content like this warning "This post is from 12 years ago, and may no longer reflect the most recent version of our software".Flattening a bunch of dynamic pages to static HTML can also be useful, if the concern is maintaining old forum software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately the "internet doesn't forget" statement has been false since many years. Most companies couldn't care less about keeping the wealth information they've accumulated accessible.I remember a few years ago TI got bored with updating their cpuwiki, and deleted the whole this - which stings to this day. The internet is still full of links to it to solve crucial issues, only to be greeted with a disappointing error message.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571995</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article celebrates the 400-year history of Zildjian Cymbals, a renowned cymbal manufacturer based in Massachusetts. It highlights the company's origins, tracing back to its founding in 1623, and discusses its significance in the music industry, particularly in drumming. The piece includes reflections on the craftsmanship, innovation, and cultural impact of Zildjian cymbals, showcasing how they have remained a preferred choice among musicians around the world. Additionally, it touches on the company's commitment to maintaining traditional manufacturing techniques while adapting to modern demands.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Zildjian" is an Armenian last name, but "Zildji" (zilci) means "cymbalist"/"cymbal-maker", or more generically, "bell-maker" in Turkish. "-ian" is the Armenian patronymic suffix. The whole word means something like "Cymbalistson" which makes it the most fitting company name to produce cymbals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zildjian's original craftsmanship actually lives on in Istanbul. Mehmet Tamdeger, who began apprenticing at age nine under Mikhail Zilcan (grandson of Kerope Zilcan, of K series fame) and master smith Kirkor Kucukyan, continued the traditional techniques from the 1950s K. Zilcan factory in Istanbul.What's fascinating is that Tamdeger and master smith Agop Tomurcuk preserved these methods by founding "Istanbul" cymbals. Initially exporting to the US under "Zildjiler" before switching to "Istanbul" in 1984, each cymbal was personally signed by both masters. After Agop's unexpected death in 1996, Mehmet continued under "Istanbul Mehmet", maintaining the 17th-century hand-crafting methods with the philosophy "Machines don't have ears."The cymbals they make are particularly sought after by jazz drummers for what's known as the "old K sound" - referring to the original K Zildjians made in its place of birth.Here is one for sale:https://soundsanatolian.com/products/istanbul-mehmet-22-mika...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use a mix of cymbals, also Zildjian, and the last years I've moved more to Istanbul cymbals but did not know this part of history and the connection the craft had to the old city. It is not surprising, though. Istanbul has a history as a cultural center since the Roman empire and before, holding its position long after Rome fell. It is one of my favorite cities in the world because of the mix of cultures across crafts and arts, and people - also within music. It's role in the cymbal and drum making history just adds to my impression. Istanbul unfortunately currently is a shadow of what it was, after many years of Erdogan and his followers' efforts to make Turkey less liberal and secular. I do hope history will show that this will turn, and that Istanbul will continue to be a metropol of blended cultures and creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42560069</guid></item><item><title>7. iTerm2 critical security release</title><link>https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The iTerm2 changelog provides a detailed overview of the updates and improvements made in version 3.5.11 of the iTerm2 terminal emulator. It highlights bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new features introduced in this release, ensuring users are informed about the changes that may impact their experience. The changelog serves as a resource for users to understand how the software has evolved and to troubleshoot any issues they may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused by the comments saying "Just don't use iTerm2." The same class of issue can occur for any other project, and switching is not a very effective defense against it.If anything, having an embarrassing issue like this is probably going to improve the iTerm2 project's security posture in the medium term. It's like that joke about firing the engineer who caused the incident, and the manager who retorts, "Why would I fire them? They just learned the hard way never to make this mistake again." (I'm paraphrasing.) I don't think that iTerm2 has had a notably high rate of critical security issues, and I suspect they won't make this class of mistake twice. (And if they do - then I will re-evaluate.)I suppose intuitively I would think that using the default MacOS Terminal app is a bit lower-risk than using iTerm2 or any other open source terminal emulator, as Terminal is a rather sparse piece of Apple-provided software with a low pace of change. But it's also closed source and impossible to audit, so there are tradeoffs there too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the replies here, I am not even sure how to react, it seems this community overall is going into a sad direction that just blames instead of trying to think of solutions.Most of them are just entitled and aggressive for absolutely no reason.It's perfectly fine to want to switch, or try something else, but to think other projects couldn't have issues is just naive to say it gently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel deeply for the developer who develops iTerm for relatively very little money, and already took a lot of criticism for the AI integration, far more than was warranted.I am also also deeply concerned about my use of iTerm now.I access HPC environments where I may have access for a short period of time. I am expected to take responsibility to clear out my data after use and don't expect there to be any data leakage. If I had been manipulating PII research data in the past year and using iTerm's SSH integration I would be in a bit of a bind and have to send some really embarrassing emails asking sysadmins to see if these logs exist, and if they belong to me, followed by disclosing data had been leaked.I use some of the more advanced features but at this point wonder if I should be using any features beyond the basic, and then I may as well be using another terminal. I haven't found a cross-platform editor that feels as native on MacOS as iTerm, ghostty included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579472</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Although I was on an AI team, I often pushed back against applying AI unless we had a really compelling reason. What is the user problem we are trying to solve? Do we really need an LLM or could a few if statements suffice? Are we sure that natural language is the appropriate interface for this?This practical approach to AI feels refreshing in a field drowning in buzzwords. I’ve built tools where simple regression models outperformed neural networks, and convincing teams was an uphill battle. It's hard to not get pushback from teams for not going all-in on AI when it seems decisions and budgets are hype-driven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have had a somewhat similar journey but 14 years instead of 25 and I always wonder how it would be different today.We were lucky enough to grow up with the industry and progressively learn more complexity. The kids out of school today are faced with decades worth of complexity on day one on the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It makes such a refreshing change to have a web page not cluttered with adverts and popups.

Postgres UUIDv7 and per-back end monotonicity</title><link>https://brandur.org/fragments/uuid-v7-monotonicity</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of UUID version 7 and its monotonicity, focusing on the importance of having unique identifiers that maintain their order over time. It explains how UUID v7 is designed to provide time-based, sortable, and unique values while addressing the challenges of random and non-monotonic identifiers. The author explores the advantages of using UUID v7 in various applications, particularly for distributed systems, and provides insights into implementation considerations to ensure efficiency and reliability in generating these UUIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would strongly implore people not to follow the example this post suggests, and write code that relies on this monotonicity.The reason for this is simple: the documentation doesn't promise this property. Moreover, even if it did, the RFC for UUIDv7 doesn't promise this property. If you decide to depend on it, you're setting yourself up for a bad time when PostgreSQL decides to change their implementation strategy, or you move to a different database.Further, the stated motivations for this, to slightly simplify testing code, are massively under-motivating. Saving a single line of code can hardly be said to be worth it, but even if it were, this is a problem far better solved by simply writing a function that will both generate the objects and sort them.As a profession, I strongly feel we need to do a better job orienting ourselves to the reality that our code has a tendency to live for a long time, and we need to optimize not for "how quickly can I type it", but "what will this code cost over its lifetime".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember even if timestamps may be generated using a monotonically increasing value that does not mean they were committed in the same order to the database. It is an entirely separate problem if you are trying to actually determine what rows are "new" versus "previously seen" for things like cursor-based APIs and background job processing. This problem exists even with things like a serial/autoincrement primary key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The Postgres patch solves the problem by repurposing 12 bits of the UUID’s random component to increase the precision of the timestamp down to nanosecond granularity [...]&gt;It makes a repeated UUID between processes more likely, but there’s still 62 bits of randomness left to make use of, so collisions remain vastly unlikely.Does it? Even though the number of random bits has decreased, the time interval to create such a duplicate has also decreased, namely to an interval of one nanosecond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575900</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;MiniKanren is a minimalist programming language aimed at teaching logic programming and relational programming concepts. It uses a small set of core abstractions to facilitate reasoning about programs and enable the development of complex queries and relationships between data. The website provides resources, including documentation, tutorials, and examples, to help users understand and implement MiniKanren in various contexts, promoting its use in both educational settings and advanced programming applications.&lt;/p&gt;

I went back to school to add a credential after my name to make myself employable. My experience running the back office for a long-distance reseller (FoxPro 2.6 database: application support, running customer service, billing, reporting, and being the networking yeoman) didn't look impressive on my resume without some additional alphabet soup.This was my programming languages -- interpreters class. Dr Daniel Friedman ran a teach-along that culminated in implementing miniKanren in scheme. First day of class, the front row was empty. I was ten years older than every other student in the room (with the exception of Will Byrd). I sheepishly shrugged and took one of the offered seats in the row. For the next hour, the sheer force of scheme being written on the whiteboard blew my mind open. That continued for 16 weeks, three days a week. I highly recommend the experience.I (probably) still have a pre-press copy of The Reasoned Schemer in a box in my attic. It was one of the goodies handed out on the last day of class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minikanren was the subject of a phenomenal talk by Matt Might for it's applications in medicine[0] https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/algorithm-for-precisio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while back I was trying to understand the guts of miniKanren.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to diagnose an unusual Wi-Fi issue characterized by intermittent connectivity problems. It outlines a systematic approach to identify the root cause, including checking hardware, examining network configurations, and using diagnostic tools. The author emphasizes the importance of documenting the troubleshooting process and presents specific tests to perform, such as signal strength analysis and interference detection. Additionally, potential solutions are offered, ranging from adjusting router settings to considering firmware updates. The aim is to equip readers with the knowledge to resolve similar Wi-Fi issues effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very similar to an issue I battled for months on MacBook Pro (one of the later Intel versions, like 2018-ish), although there problem was not in the HW itself but the current version of MacOS at that time (this is no longer an issue).I noticed that my WiFi had similar repeating lags .. about every 8-10s pings would go to a few hundred ms and then return to single/low double digits.Long story short, the problem was with several MacOS  components (and maybe some 3rd party software) requesting Location services to determine Mac’s position. To do that, among other things, Mac scans WiFi around you (probably for the names/SSID?) and to do that, the current WIFI connection is temporarily put on a back burner, resulting in a brief delay in traffic. The solution was to minimize location services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;First, I purchased a new, highly-reviewed, wifi adapter on Amazon.This is not how you find a high quality product on Amazon.&gt;It didn’t resolve the issue. It did, however, come with an offer for a free 64GB flash drive in exchange for a good reviews.Now you  know why it was so highly reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was certain that I read about a very similar issue here in the past, and after some searching, found this exact article posted 2 years ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32524702&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575990</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the versatility of Ruby on Rails as a framework that can be applied to a wide range of projects beyond traditional web applications. It highlights the benefits of using Rails for different types of applications, such as APIs, command-line tools, and data processing tasks. The author emphasizes the framework's convention over configuration approach, robust libraries, and community support that make it suitable for various programming challenges.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been building some apps with stacks lately that are supposed to be more modern and performant. Namely an app with Spring Boot and another with Micronaut. Both had a React frontend. It really made me appreciate Rails' omakase approach. Just having a form that shows validation errors from the backend and having something as simple as Rails' flash messages isn't solved by the frameworks themselves and requires you to build it yourself or find a third-party solution that might or might not do the basic thing you need or might or might not be well-supported. Rails truly solves the problems 90% of web apps share. It might not be in a way that's perfect for your specific project but it will likely work and you can swap it out one you've validated you app or feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails is awesome, and so is Django. I’ve built mission-critical apps in both and still do with Python. That said, I’d love to switch to Go for building large monoliths since it has a tighter type system and better concurrency constructs.The problem is, Go community has never really filled that gap. I love Go, but the whole "Go doesn’t need a Rails or Django" mindset is part of why it hasn’t taken off in this space. Building networking tools and CLIs in Go is great, but when it comes to quickly building a full-stack web app, I still reach for Rails or Django. So this whole "X is dead" doesn't apply to Rails at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; if you follow (the Rails Guides) start to finish, you'll have a Rails app in production. And it isn't just hello world. Your app will have authentication, caching, rich text, continuous integration, and a database. That's a real application.These features are great for established apps like GitHub and Airbnb, but if you're making a tiny startup, and want to test ideas quickly, I wouldn't spend time on CI, caching, Rails's authentication (use extremely feature rich Devise gem), Rails's 'turbo' features, and writing tests. These are all good things for medium or larger apps, or well-funded apps with a long run way, but are usually cost-benefit negative for small apps.Turbo saves a fraction of a second on many page loads, but can add days of development time for those not fluent in javascript when it causes some core functionality to not work (e.g. devise's Log out!). Testing is very important on large apps but for quickly flicking a few ideas together and getting it in front of users; unless you're a banking or healthcare app, they can probably be postponed until you have traction.Be mindful of your size and timelines and don't succumb to 'default bias' where you use things simply because they were there out of the box. Feel confident to say 'no, we don't need that (for now)'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569236</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Advent of Code 2024 event and presents solutions to the coding challenges using pure SQL. It emphasizes the approach of solving algorithmic problems with SQL, showcasing examples and techniques that highlight SQL's capabilities beyond traditional data retrieval. The author provides insights on how to tackle various challenges, encouraging readers to think creatively about applying SQL in programming contests.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nicely done. I know this seems crazy at first but in my opinion big SQLs are one of the best ways to store complexity.The problem being complex is the issue. SQL is a standard, condensed, extremely performant, actually testable, and logical language. Sure, not anybody can instantly maintain it but that would be the same as if it was a lot of lines and functions in Java. The more lines the more risk for bugs.I also love how deep SQL goes. And that makes totally sense. It powers the world of data since 40+ years so of course people asked for niche features. One of my favorite is the model clause in Oracle with which you can implement multidimensional arrays. A friend implemented Conway's game of life with it in way less lines you expect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been writing a ton of SQL -- implementing a lot of the business logic of a (stream processing) application in it. I really really like it, especially that I bring the computation to the data instead of the data to the computation.I often talk to developers who hate that idea though. They want me to instead move all the data to the backend, for a massive IO hit, just so that the computations can be expressed in a "real" programming language.I think SQL the concept is good but SQL the language is the problem. There are so many awkward things in it -- not strange as it has had no competition in 40(?) years!! The mental model of the program I write is fine but I really need to overlook the syntax and to the program I am really writing to see any elegance...What we need I think is a properly designed programming language, designed for existing databases (Postgres, MSSQL) compiling to SQL dialects. I see some contenders but they all have some attachment to a special domain, such as not allowing data modifications (PreQL) or being associated with other databases.Itching to do it myself, but it's a lot of work and a long long road to any adoption with no guarantee of success, and no revenue stream that I can think of.The most popular backend languages were made by large companies, but I think coding in SQL is in a catch-22 where it will be frowned upon until there is a better language and no better language until it is more popular..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reacted to this title the way I react a new menu item at Taco Bell: a strange mixture of desire, shame, and admiration for human ingenuity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577736</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the dilemma faced by wealthy individuals who struggle with finding purpose and direction in their lives despite their financial success. It emphasizes the contrast between material wealth and personal fulfillment, exploring the potential lack of motivation, identity, and meaningful goals that can arise when one is financially secure. The author encourages readers to seek deeper meaning through personal interests, meaningful relationships, and contributing to society, rather than relying solely on wealth for happiness. Ultimately, it advocates for a balanced approach to life that prioritizes fulfillment over mere financial abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the most childish thing I’ve read. And shows a lot about he doesn’t have any people relying on him or community to support. He takes one hike and throws away 60m. Doesn’t try to find anything interesting to do at Atlassian just calls his coworkers NPCs. This is zero-empathy Peter Pan syndrome at its worse.Sad how he just goes adventure hopping to try and find meaning. The problem is no matter where you are you are also there. Time to look inward and not outward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think you have to have Fuck You Money to get to this point. Most people eventually become disillusioned with work enough that they reevaluate what matters to them. Getting a very profitable exit is just one way to trigger that experience.In my experience, a lot of people who get into this state start self-sabotaging hard as a way of rejecting what feels, ironically, like losing control. Sudden freedom can feel foreign and lot like your world got forcibly taken away from you. I'm not surprised the author is turning down opportunities and breaking off with his girlfriend. It's a way of taking back control.When this happened to me, I pivoted hard from getting satisfaction out of what I built to getting satisfaction out of developing people. Now I take great pride out of the careers I've nurtured...a lot more than what I've built, in most ways. I've heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like "I now enjoy making other people rich."No matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances). Something I did not read in this essay is how he grew closer to anyone (in fact, I read the opposite). No path out of this valley involves traveling alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't imagine a world where I wouldn't know what to do.There is diarrhea on my building,  trash in the street, people needing medical help in the alley, and potholes in the street.Just walk out your front door and start doing things.My recent triumph was getting a building owner on my street to finally repair the hole in front of their building.  Imagine what I could do with a backhoe.Start small, think big.  Help people who deserve it in real, honest (typically not through the computer) ways.I'd much rather be less wealthy in that way to be rich in this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579873</guid></item><item><title>17.

Make sure you have 64GB of RAM. I only had 16GB, but allocating additional 48GB of swap worked.There are probably some redundant steps, but this worked for me last time I tried.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This project is the first that tickles my brain in the right serendipitous ways; it merges topics of my recent interests.However, after a VERY short perusal, I grew a giant sense of empathy for non-native English speakers. The readme is gentle enough to English speakers (aka: +95% English) no less I felt like I muddled through renaming tokens in my mind as I went. However, that quickly showed me two things.1. It reminds me why I never seem to finish classic Russian literature… so often get lost in the introductory parade of names that are a cache miss for my usual set of names.2. This is perhaps a significant cultural muscle that has never been necessitated for English speakers. Since the earth has largely been using English (in some capacity) for significantly longer than my life span - as my favorite joke says in the punch line “what do you call someone who only knows one language… uni-lingual… jk: American”PS: it seems like there could be an open registry maintained by “Americans like me” who would rather pre-process the code for tokens within the docs and src… seems like a “DefinitelyTyped style” definitions registry would be very niche, but SUPER useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I posted a link to this project a few weeks ago as well! It's really interesting to see an academic project like this one.For people interested, there's bi-weekly blogs (some in English) linked here: https://docs.xiangshan.cc/zh-cn/latest/blog/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42576242</guid></item><item><title>18.

RAG in my experience usually requires a decent amount of customization to your input data for chunk formatting and other things to work well,  are these systems flexible enough?What if you want to integrate it into an existing system, are these for local use only? So everyone on e.g. a team has to set it up themselves?Kinda curious what the exact use case is I have seen a few of these repos with 10k+ stars but don't really get what it's used for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks great. Integrations with Graphrag framework is helpful.Are you able to monitor Token and Cost per user and per session?Also, lots of times users have the same  question worded differently .Is there a cost effective way of answering them from cache?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571272</guid></item><item><title>20.

I wonder if 1) its possible to overcome the "hardware lottery" that transformers have now won, and 2) if recurrent/selective state can do the kind of proper lookback on extremely long context that we will want it to do to compete with full attention (easy to say no, harder to propose what to do about it).there's also Liquid AI, whatever it is that they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idea for killer app for recurrent models: low latency, low memory LLM / TTS coupling. Start decoding / generating speech as soon as new tokens are generated. When the LLM is cranking out token t, the TTS is already working on token t-1. It doesn’t have to wait. Then when the LLM is finished, the TTS is nearly finished too. The two models being colocated you just saved another network call as well.Recurrent models with constant hidden state are naturally suited to streaming data, potentially opening the door to unexplored new use cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey there, im Eugene / PicoCreator - co-leading the RWKV project - feel free to AMA =)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42554161</guid></item><item><title>21. 4.5M Suspected Fake Stars in GitHub</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13459</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a comprehensive examination of the concept of "adaptive invariance," which refers to the ability of certain systems to maintain consistent properties despite changes in parameters or environments. It discusses the theoretical foundations of adaptive invariance, explores its implications across various scientific domains, and offers insight into its potential applications in fields like robotics and ecology. The authors aim to deepen the understanding of how systems can adapt while retaining crucial invariance, potentially leading to advancements in both theoretical and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

This is how it goes - run hackathons or sponsor events in Universities. There are a ton of colleges who are constantly seeking support to run events.Some companies take advantage of this by asking for stars in return of sponsorship. I have seen proposals that say for a $2000 sponsorship - 2000 stars guaranteed. The way it works is if a participant registers in the event they also have to show proof that they starred a specific repo that belongs to the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All metrics will be gamed at some point. I don't know exactly how you could even fight this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t like stars as a metric. Or at least as a comparator. If you brag about having a millions stars that says something as a million is a lot.But if you brag that your project as a million and your competitor has half a million, that is so illogical that I would discount your project and think it’s run by dummies.Are there practical situations where people really need stars enough to buy them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540182</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the principles of effective presentation design based on Edward Tufte's guidelines, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and the use of data visualization. It critiques common issues found in PowerPoint presentations, such as overcrowded slides, excessive text, and poor visual design. The author advocates for a more thoughtful approach to presentation creation, encouraging the use of well-designed graphs and charts that convey information clearly and engage the audience. The goal is to enhance the overall impact of presentations through better design practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody has the patience anymore to be presented to or read in any form other than bullet points and low information density charts.I grew up before computers and learned to communicate in the absence of all the short attention span distractions that exist today.  I remember the first time I picked up a Wired magazine and couldn’t tolerate the insane lack of continuity.  I still cannot stand the video style of images projected for a fraction of a second one after the other.But no one has the patience for my storytelling style.  Congratulations if you got this far, most people gave up if they didn’t grok my point in the first two sentences.Yes slideware is ugly and low information and boring and insulting to the audience, but some people, particularly in higher levels of management, just want to be spoon fed bullet lists and then feel like they’re making informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibly unpopular opinion: PowerPoint is just a tool, and most people not only suck at making slides but are poor storytellers to boot. If you are a good storyteller and can effectively use the medium (as in, not just dump a bunch of bullets on a slide), you can actually convey a lot of information in a combined slide + narrative format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this criticises PowerPoint - I don't think it sufficiently outlines an alternative.As someone that has tried to write a decision paper before rather than a PowerPoint deck, I found the main challenge was engagement (i.e. encouraging people to read it is a challenge, while a powerpoint can be walked through together).I could present a spreadsheet, but that only addresses the financials or numbers and won't address the business context.And if you go into a board meeting empty handed to talk about a large investment - good luck!I think it's probably a case of horses-for-courses: Sometimes PowerPoint is a great format, other times it might not be, and like any format it can either be used well or poorly. The issue in the Columbia example wasn't PowerPoint per-se, it was that the managers weren't clear in their communication.And while bullet points are poor in some ways - they are great in others. Distilling ideas down and making sure your list is MECE is part of clear communication and thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549147</guid></item><item><title>23.

It’s a mysterious sequence of twists and folds until you get to the end, and then: wow, it’s a beautiful swan!&gt; A grand finale might be fun for origami, but it’s stressful for the reader."Yes, a lot of tutorials are puzzle games. You need to guess other tools to install, which are obvious to the author, but not everyone.I would add a few things:* Have two types of examples - minimal and the most typical (one is to show the essence without distraction, the second to serve as a practical starting point) 
* Always provide the full code sequence to run code; if there are any assumptions, these should be listed explicitly (e.g. "it needs Node 22"); you hinted a bit, but since many tutorials miss that, it deserves attention.Even better, if it is possible to combine it into one point and make it runnable. For example, for a package I had been developing, livelossplot, I made  Jupyter Notebooks runnable in Colab:* https://colab.research.google.com/github/stared/livelossplot...
* https://colab.research.google.com/github/stared/livelossplot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope that plenty of developers read this, especially folks on open source projects who don't have dedicated documentation people. There's so much bad documentation out there, and many of these tips are key.A couple more of my own:TEST YOUR DOCSAs @codetrotter suggests in another comment, run through your own tutorial with a fresh VM and follow it closely; you'll almost certainly find something to improve.But this works better if you have someone else try it out instead: get on a video call with them, have them share their screen and speak their thoughts out loud, and most importantly, don't help them. You're trying to find out if they can complete this without additional help. (Yes, it's a usability test.)BETTER SOFTWARE MAKES SIMPLER TUTORIALSThe article's rule about "let computers evaluate conditional logic" is a good one, but there are multiple places to fix that problem. Sometimes it's in the tutorial, sometimes it's in the software product itself. When the tutorial makes the reader do complex work, it may be a sign that the software has UX issues. You may not be in a position to fix it, but you can probably file an issue.For the example in the article: could you make the same package name work on all three Debian versions? It'd certainly improve the user experience, and probably make the installation process more resilient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here.I've been thinking for a long time about anti-patterns I see when following software tutorials, so I put together this list of things I think differentiate good tutorials from poor ones.I'm happy to hear any feedback on this list or hear about other things I should include.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574641</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;Mercure is an open-source protocol and project designed to enable real-time communication between web applications and clients, allowing them to receive updates from a server instantly. It leverages the HTTP/2 protocol for efficient delivery and supports a pub/sub model where publishers can send events to subscribers. The repository provides comprehensive documentation, installation steps, and examples for implementation, making it easy for developers to integrate real-time features into their applications. Additionally, it emphasizes security through features like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took a decent amount of digging, but it seems like this is trying to be a browser-compatible pubsub system more than a direct websocket replacement. The main thing they're doing is introducing a "mercure hub" between event producers and consumers (browsers) that handles delivery through SSE in a way that tracks subscribers and handles sporadic or interrupted connection.However what confuses me is that they seem to focus mostly on the protocol, hub, and publish implementation. At least based on a quick glance at https://mercure.rocks/docs/ecosystem/awesome and elsewhere it seems they expect you to use raw SSE clientside according to their protocol described in eg https://mercure.rocks/spec#active-subscriptions.Most of their clientside examples look pretty simple but they don't seem like they're fully implementing the logic described in "Reconnection, State Reconciliation and Event Sourcing" which seems rather complex. Maybe I'm missing something but it seems like that logic is the entire reason to use this over SSE alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please explain why this is better than websockets.I read the Github readme, but it doesn't say what's better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also I could recommend https://github.com/slact/nchan. It has the same idea: hide  and abstract pubsub complexity for a backend service. nchan is built on top of nginx and could be more convenient (existing nginx configuration knowledge) to deploy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571651</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to strike down the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) net neutrality rules, which aimed to ensure an open internet by preventing internet service providers from blocking or throttling access to content. The ruling reflects ongoing legal and political debates surrounding net neutrality, with implications for how internet services are regulated in the U.S. The article highlights the arguments supporting and opposing net neutrality, the potential impact on consumers and businesses, and the possibility of future regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always felt the FCC was an inappropriate path for enforcing this. Ideally it would be powers granted to the FTC either through legislation or potentially through existing powers they might already have in this domain.The FCC's jurisdiction on this was already shaky even before Chevron was overturned, I think the moment activism was pushed in this direction net neutrality was doomed a decade of unending lawsuits. Even if they somehow made it passed the courts, I'm not quite convinced the FCC would be motivated to actually do much about this even with a sympathetic administration. Consider that prior to the internet, they were pretty much created to do the opposite of what people want from net neutrality.These are just my armchair thoughts though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised this legal turn has so little discussion on HN right now. NN had felt like an evergreen hot debate topic for at least the past decade7 years ago, 3000+ upvotes:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15924794&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm reminded of when it was legal for cellphone companies to charge different fees to access different websites.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Meta's initiative to integrate more artificial intelligence bots into its platforms, Facebook and Instagram. It highlights the company's strategy to enhance user experience by using AI to power features such as chatbots and personalized content recommendations. The push for increased AI functionality aligns with broader trends in social media aiming to engage users more effectively while also addressing concerns regarding privacy and content moderation. Meta's efforts reflect its commitment to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This gave me a funny idea for a new social media app...One that's centered around "you" and filled with thousands/millions of LLM bots praising you, treating you like a celebrity, etc. Each of your posts will get tens of thousands of "likes", hundreds of comments, etc. Dm's straight to your feed, people wanting you, etc etc.If the newsfeed is already mostly "the algorithm", might as well take it to the extreme. I bet tons of people would get addicted to the dopamine hit of celebrity status (whether it's bots or not).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My FB timeline is already a complete mess with most irrelevant garbage as it stands. Not exactly sure what adding additional 'noise' is going to achieve outside of boosting numbers (which I guess is what they want).A current snapshot my feed:  - Group post (from one I follow)  
  - Ad  
  - Post (from company I don't follow)  
  - Group post (from Group I don't follow)  
  - Group post (from one I follow)  
  - Ad  
  - Group post (from Group I don't follow)  
  - Group post (from Group I don't follow)

I gave up writing the above, but it was about 9 more posts before I saw a post from a person I actually know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook Meta has been making baffling bets lately. They spent tens of billions building a metaverse with the belief that people want to spend their days in a creepy legless 3d avatar of themselves that is pretty effective at simulating what it feels to have body dysphoria, playing with their other legless friends and spending a lot of money customizing their dysphoric avatars.Now they believe what users really want from social media is less social human connection. What users really want is AI spam and parasocial relationships with corporate AI celebrities. They don't want Facebook to tackle the problem of fake celebrities and fake profiles of handsome men sending friend requests in an attempt to romance scam them, what they really want is more fake profilesI really believe Zuckerberg is a lizard after all, I can't find any other sane explanation for this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571608</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of effectively managing knowledge in organizations beyond traditional approaches, such as rag (red-amber-green) systems. It emphasizes building a comprehensive knowledge management framework that fosters collaboration, innovation, and learning. The author highlights strategies for capturing, sharing, and utilizing knowledge, along with the role of technology in enhancing these processes. The piece advocates for a cultural shift towards valuing knowledge as a key asset, ultimately aiming to improve decision-making and organizational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After trying out a bunch of digital zettelkasten tools, I just went back to paper.This take may be a bit hot, but I actually think paper and pen is already the optimal maxima for thinking—not for retrieval, mind you, but for helping us produce new thoughts. Zettelkasten (at least the way Luhmann used it) is meant for this purpose—it is not a system for storing information and retrieving it but rather for supporting the creation of new connections.The computer aided tools are suboptimal for this because they lack the good constrains of paper (severely limiting the search space) and the good features (seamless ability to incorporate a variety of representational modes, text, image, equation, with zero overhead, and the ability to organize things freely in space). As much as the digital knowledge base sounds good in theory, I don't think it will ever be as optimal for generation of thought. If all you want to do is summon existing information, digital tools are evidently superior. I personally think a hybrid system where one "thinks" on paper and "archives" digitally (after the thinking is done) might be best, but ultimately, we will be most productive with whatever system we actually enjoy using.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; From Socrates worrying that writing would destroy memory [...]  Think of it as a partnership: the computer handles the organizational heavy lifting, while you focus on the thinking.I'm less worried about memory per se and more about failing to think, or getting brainwashed/ring-led by a system with its own biases and quirks. Any sufficiently complex organizing is thinking!Perhaps the simplest example is when quantities (numbers, easy to record) get a mental weight that overshadows and hides their dimensions (the definitions, what they really mean.) For example, a tendency to automatically assume a rising GDP number is an unqualified good sign.Stuff like LLMs bring that into newer and more-dangerous territory, because the model also contains uncountable subtle biases from its training data, and even if you know it isn't aligned (heh) with your own mental models you can't reliably change it. Much like false-memories implanted by interrogators, patterns in those systems can and will leak into the users. Whenever we can't "think about how our thinking is being changed", I'd say that's axiomatically bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When you're dealing with ten notes, it's trivial to dump them into an LLM and generate connections. With a hundred notes, it's still manageable. But what happens when you hit 10,000 notes? Or a million? We quickly run into the limitations of context windows and processing capacity. Vector search helps narrow things down, but it's prone to missing important connections that a human mind might naturally make.I run into the same problem. I made a RAG system and imported 15 years of reddit and HN content (my own message logs) + 2 years of LLM chats, totaling about 80MB of text. I can use it to retrieve fragments but there is duplication, and almost all duplicate fragments have slightly different approaches. How do I merge all of them, and how do I get a deduplicated taxonomy? I got about 290K unique keywords extracted from the text, it doesn't fit into LLMs.I am gravitating towards building graphs of ideas, and having a way to generate unique (non duplicate) new ideas while ingesting new text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577387</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The "unsubscribe" button in Indeed's job notification emails leads me to an impassable Cloudflare challenge.That's a CAN-SPAM act violation.FTC: "Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future marketing email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting marketing email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all marketing messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests."[1]Experian was recently fined for making it hard to opt out of their marketing emails.The actual regulation text:§ 316.5 Prohibition on charging a fee or imposing other requirements on recipients who wish to opt out.Neither a sender nor any person acting on behalf of a sender may require that any recipient pay any fee, provide any information other than the recipient's electronic mail address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps except sending a reply electronic mail message or visiting a single Internet Web page, in order to:(a) Use a return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3), to submit a request not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages from a sender; or(b) Have such a request honored as required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3)(B) and (a)(4).That seems to cover it. File a CAN-SPAM act complaint (spam@uce.gov). Send a copy to the legal department of the sender.[1] https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're collateral damage in the web's war against bots :(Unfortunately, I think the Cloudflare challenges are designed to filter out users similar to your profile... once you stray far enough from the norm, it just looks like a bot / suspicious traffic to them. Statistically there's not enough users like you (privacy-conscious Linux users on nonstandard browsers) for them to really care enough to do anything about it. Site owners don't care either since you're usually like 1-2% of users at most, and typically also the same ones who block ads, etc., so they don't mind blocking you... it's sad, but I don't think there is really anything you can do about it except conform. It's an ongoing arms race and you're caught in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem is that any solution so far proposed for this is very privacy-unfriendly.For example, Google proposed https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/Web-Environment-In... and this was shot down by privacy advocates (for very good reasons).So basically the choice for website operators is either to fight the bots and accept that their service will be unusable for some subset of their users or not fight the bots, which will lead to their service becoming unusable for everyone.More and more, you see services pushing you very hard towards using their app and the reason is that with the app, they are able to actually verify that you are likely not a bot (or rather, in reality, that at least the app is running on an actual physical device, mobile phone bot farms are unfortunately also a thing).As for Cloudflare - they offer it as a service, so when the website operator has a choice between using them or allocating several engineers for bot-fighting, why would they not just go with Cloudflare? Doing it yourself can be slightly higher fidelity, as you know your customers better, but it is also a lot of effort which could be better spent elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577076</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After finishing DuoLingo’s Latin course, I wanted to read some Latin texts, but I didn't find easy enough texts and going back and forth to a dictionary was cumbersome.So I created this app for reading basic Latin texts. The idea of the app is to have a Latin text with translation of each word under the paragraph line, which makes it easy to grasp the meaning but also focuses on reading the original Latin text.It only has one book, if I finish it I might add others.I used OpenAI to do the translation which looks pretty good for me, with the caveat that... well... I do not know Latin. This approach will not probably work for more complex texts.This mode of reading works for me, not sure if is of interest to anyone else.The app source is on GitHub if you are interested:https://github.com/aleris/duplex-lectioA couple of details about the dev process:https://adi.earth/posts/duplex-lectio-read-latin-bilingual/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is nice! I do use ChatGPT a fair amount as I’m still crap at Latin and Greek, but a lot of scholarship just plonks it in untranslated. It has always worked fine for getting the gist. I am extremely lucky in that while moving house my wife allowed me to buy the complete Loeb collection but until then I spent a lot of time on Tufts’ Perseus library. The Latin and English sources (and Greek for that matter) are all in XML on GitHub, so some enterprising soul could probably hook up a wider set of books from here:https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit/tree/master&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suggest using ruby annotations for the translation part.I am building a sanskrit reader[1] and needed a feature that allowed users to tag words with notes/meaning. ruby annotations work wonderfully for that.[1] Site: https://www.adhyeta.org.in/Backend: https://github.com/s-i-e-v-e/adhyeta(The vocabulary features require a login, which is not open to the public as of yet.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540397</guid></item><item><title>31.

Much less than that, and you just wait. 
Much more than that, and you schedule something else to do, with a reminder.But in that frame, you can't really wait, you can't context switch productively..... which ends you on HN, commenting on articles about people who wrote the most used software in the world (solitaire &amp; tetris) _while compiling the second most used software in the world (a popular OS)_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious question:If I want to write small games in assembly code, such as minesweeper, solitaire and maybe simple 2d RPGs, which modern platform is the easiest to approach?

&lt;p&gt;The article from Snopes addresses the claim that there are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way galaxy. It explains that a study estimated there are approximately 3 trillion trees on Earth, while other estimates suggest there are around 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. The piece highlights the uncertainty in the number of stars and the challenges in counting them accurately.

A trillion is 10^12 which is 10^4 cubed or 10^6 squared. That means a cube with 10,000 items along each dimension, or a square with a million items on each dimension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, there are estimated to be possibly a quadrillion individuals of bristlemouth species in the genus Cyclothone... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This made me think "wow, maybe the universe isn't so big after all", and then I remembered there are somewhere between 200 billion and 2 trillion other galaxies out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570138</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the declining relevance of traditional blogs compared to wikis, arguing that the blog format often leads to information becoming quickly outdated and forgotten. It emphasizes how wikis, by allowing collaborative editing and continuous updates, create a more sustainable repository of knowledge. The author suggests that wikis can foster community engagement and are more adaptable to the evolving nature of information, contrasting with the stagnant nature of many blogs. The piece ultimately advocates for a shift towards wiki-style platforms for long-term knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As both a reader and a writer I disagree:* A blog post is a snapshot: what did the author think at the time they wrote the post?  If they change their mind or learn more, they write a new post and link forward and backwards.  I know how to write for this environment (write what I think now, try to write things I'll feel glad to have written later) and how to work with things other people have written (consider the date, it's just one person's view).* A wiki page is unclear.  When should it be updated?  How much should I trust that it was up-to-date as of the last-updated date vs that just being when someone fixed a typo?  A few wikis and sites with wiki-like approaches (Wikipedia, gwern.net) manage to handle this well, but I think it's generally much more difficult and rot-prone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the sentiment of this, I feel it very strongly. But I also think this is just another expression of personal website anxiety. This is the same sentiment that lead to the  boom in digital gardens, notion, PKM etc.I haven't accepted it yet, but I think people who host their own personal websites need to accept that they're hosting a personal website, and it's going to change over time as they change. People already know and accept and see that as a feature of a personal website. It's necessary as the tech changes too, a personal website with the latest and greatest tech from 20 years ago renders like garbage in a modern browser.I really don't mean to sound mean, and I do sincerely empathise and sympathise with the author, because every year or 2, I have the same revelation that my website hasn't been updated in a while, and it's not my fault, it my platform just isn't technically correct and it's too restrictive and _that's_ what's stopping me being consistent on my personal website. But let's be honest, that's a me problem for not updating it or adding to it.Every year or 2 for the past 20 years, I'm sure many of us could write the same "&lt;my current website structure&gt; rots. &lt;The one I had an epiphany about a few days ago&gt; wait".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wikis are great, but it feels like outside of Wikipedia they've been dying. I wish bashhackers was still with us, and regret even more that there's not other large old school wikis for things like systems software development or other programming languages (or even a newer take on the original WikiWikiWeb). I guess maybe some of it is GitHub pages or that weird GitHub wiki thing now, but they don't really feel the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571367</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and prevalence of ASCII art pornography, highlighting how this form of digital art predates the internet and played a significant role in the early online adult content scene. It explores the cultural phenomenon of Rule 34, which posits that if something exists, there is porn of it, emphasizing the creativity and subversive nature of ASCII pr0n. The piece also addresses the ongoing relevance of ASCII art in contemporary internet culture, illustrating its enduring appeal and adaptability in various digital spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that many people prioritize low prices over quality in their purchasing decisions, highlighting that consumers often overlook superior products in favor of cheaper alternatives. It emphasizes the challenges businesses face in promoting high-quality goods in a market driven by cost. The author suggests that this trend can lead to widespread mediocrity and a lack of appreciation for craftsmanship. Ultimately, the piece reflects on the implications of consumer preferences for both the marketplace and product innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, there is a huge difference between art and engineering that the author completely misses.Because most people are not competent to judge the quality of two similar product does not mean they don't care about quality. They just usually can't tell, so they go for the cheaper (which has a higher probability of being worse). And it drives the prices down, and the quality with it. Or it reinforces monopolies, because only those who already produce at scale can produce better quality at lower price.But if there was a way to correctly tell people: "look, this smartphone is 20% more expensive, but it will last twice as long and it will be more convenient for you in ways you can't understand right now", nobody would go for the worse quality, right? The problem is not that people don't care about quality, it's that they are not competent to judge it and marketing does the rest.Then the article talks a lot about art. Interestingly, the author says "I'm pride to not understand art, but let me still explain to you how it works". And then proves it by giving contradictory examples like "people don't care about quality, they will just listen to ABBA or go to the Louvre". You have to not understand ABBA or what's in the Louvre to think like that.So here is my rant: it's okay to be proud to not be knowledgeable about stuff. But then don't be surprised if people notice that you have no clue if you write about it.(Yes, I noticed the irony of writing a pedant comment about a mediocre article that prides itself in being mediocre and criticises pedantry :-) ).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such a dire outlook. There is a huge chasm between Domino's and great pizza, and between great movies and Netflix assembly-line productions. A lot of people care enough to land somewhere in between, not at the lowest common denominator. There is room for both pop culture and art.The comment on the photography is also clearly misguided: people might not be able to explain why, but the vast majority will feel that the more professional picture is pleasing/better in some way.My take: people "don't care about the details" when it's beyond understanding, but the outcomes are still materially different and meaningful at a subconscious level. Ask anyone on the street to name a movie Elvis was in...  meanwhile [insert your favorite movies here] still show up in popular vote even decades after going out of fashion. Selling mediocre products might be more lucrative, but not everything is about money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is patently false. The first part of the article boils down to "most people aren't pedants". The second part is mostly irrelevant because the Netflix pivot to "casual viewing" is a bid to enter a new market. Their viewership (and stock) would immediately tank if they switched exclusively to "casual viewing". TFA acknowledges this when elevating ABBA against something "no one has ever heard of". The insinuation is that popularity equates to quality whereas the opposite is true.It just takes time.Contrary to popular rhetoric, people are neither as dumb nor as smart as you might think.&gt; Fashionistas decry the homogeneity of modern dress. Most of us think jeans and a t-shirt are basically fine.Again, most people are neither pedants nor purists.I think that's the actual point TFA makes, but they chose an inflammatory title.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549039</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses performance optimizations for handling JSON in Ruby, specifically focusing on techniques to improve the efficiency of JSON parsing and generation. It elaborates on various strategies, including minimizing object allocations, using faster libraries, and optimizing data structures to enhance execution speed. Additionally, it compares different JSON processing libraries and provides code examples and benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations. The goal is to help developers write more efficient Ruby applications that deal with JSON data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very glad to see the work that byroot is doing as the new ruby-json maintainer!Since I was mentioned by name in part 3, perhaps I can provide some interesting commentary:&gt; All this code had recently been rewritten pretty much from scratch by Luke Shumaker ... While this code is very clean and generic, with a good separation of the multiple levels of abstractions, such as bytes and codepoints, that would make it very easy to extend the escaping logic, it isn’t taking advantage of many assumptions convert_UTF8_to_JSON could make to take shortcuts.My rewritten version was already slightly faster than the original version, so I didn't feel the need to spend more time optimizing it, at least until the simple version got merged; which I had no idea when that'd be because of silence from the then-maintainer. Every optimization would be an opportunity for more pain when rebasing away merge-conflicts; which was already painful enough the 2 times I had to do it while waiting for a reply.&gt; One of these for instance is that there’s no point validating the UTF-8 encoding because Ruby did it for us and it’s impossible to end up inside convert_UTF8_to_JSON with invalid UTF-8.I don't care to dig through the history to see exactly what changed when, but: At the time I wrote it, the unit tests told me that wasn't true; if I omitted the checks for invalid UTF-8, then the tests failed.&gt; Another is that there are only two multi-byte characters we care about, and both start with the same 0xE2 byte, so the decoding into codepoints is a bit superfluous. ... we can re-use Mame’s lookup table, but with a twist.I noted in the original PR description that I thought a lookup table would be faster than my decoder.  I didn't use a lookup table myself (1) to keep the initial version simple to make code-review simple to increase likelihood that it got merged, and (2) the old proprietary CVTUTF code used a lookup table, and because I was so familiar with the CVTUTF code, I didn't feel comfortable being the one to to re-add a lookup table. Glad to see that my suspicion was correct and that someone else did the work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're just starting out in this language, here's a list that will help you with that [0] https://chat-to.dev/post?id=453, [1] https://chat-to.dev/post?id=457 [2] https://chat-to.dev/post?id=565&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was really enjoyable to read - I really enjoy this kind of in-the-weeds optimisation and the author explains it all really well.

But my background is embedded and so large stack allocations have ruined my day more than once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42546246</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One fun thing about this is that spilling+restoring the register will fix it, so if any kind of context switch happens (thread switch, page fault, interrupt, etc.), the register will get pushed to the stack and popped back from it, and the code suddenly gets 3x faster.  Makes it a bit tricky to reproduce reliably, and led me down a few dead ends as I was writing this up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How about trying "xor ecx, ecx; inc ecx"? Or the even shorter "mov cl, 1"?It is very strange to me that the instruction used to set the shift count register can make the SHLX instruction 3× slower.I suspect this is a width restriction in the bypass/forwarding network.The 32-bit vs. 64-bit operand size distinction is especially surprising to me as SHLX only looks at the bottom 6 bits of the shift count.Unfortunately the dependency analysis circuitry seems not Intel-ligent enough to make that distinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worth noting that whether intentional or not, this would be easy to miss and unlikely to move benchmark numbers since compilers won't generate instructions like this: they would use the eax form which is 1 byte shorter and functionally equivalent.Even some assemblers will optimize this for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579969</guid></item><item><title>40.

Unless you're using PTFE or similar insulation, you will make the crimp to the insulation weaker, defeating its strain relief purpose. Worse, right at the point where the solder wicks to, there will a huge stress concentration, and all it takes is a couple of bending cycles to break the first strand. After that point there is zero strength there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the lovely type of page Google used to surface when you needed to learn something. This was the internet.It’s different now.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During a 1.75-year-long severe, debilitating depression in 2014-2015 I found the only thing I could read with any comprehension at all was the Aubrey-Maturin novels. They were a wonderful respite from an otherwise devastatingly terrible time in my life. Highly recommend you try them if you find yourself in similar straits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently reading through these novels as well, I'm on The Mauritius Command (book four). My progression into this has been:* Played way too much Sea of Thieves* Helped plan a company on-site sunset sail on a sailboat in Boston Harbor* Learned to sail at Community Boating over the last 2 seasons* Watched Master &amp; Commander: Far Side of the World after seeing too many memes about it* Listened to the first 3 of the Aubrey-Maturin series on audiobook* Gifted the entire 21 book series for my birthday* Reading through them all this year (otherwise known as "The Circumnavigation")It's truly a deep well of wonderful content that's witty, exciting, and just an amazing example of masculine friendship in literature with Jack and Stephen. Excited to read more and learn about the author!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've read the Master and Commander series once and listened to the Patrick Tull narrated audio books three times ... and am considering starting it again. (I'm a big fan of O'Brian's other stories too, don't miss those.) I love the story, but the "voice" of the author in Tull's voice is comfort food for my ears. There may be pharmaceuticals with a similar relaxing effect on my nervous system but those have worse side effects. I don't listen to music but maybe this should count as music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575155</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces "Anthrobots," a newly conceptualized living entity that embodies the convergence of technology and biology. It explores how these entities are designed to reflect human qualities and consciousness, encouraging us to rethink our relationship with technology and nature. The piece discusses the potential lessons Anthrobots can teach about empathy, connection, and the future of coexistence between humans and artificial life, emphasizing the importance of understanding this new form of existence in our rapidly evolving world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that the article draws some very far-fetched conclusions from what is essentially just a ball of cilia flailing around.The various observed categories of behavior are obviously attributable to the distribution of cilia along the surface of the anthrobot -- which push it around unevenly. Sometimes in circles, or sometimes in a straight line when the forces are balanced.Sure, down the line we will be able to do some really crazy stuff by bioengineering robots like this. But not anytime soon if we're still stuck at this phase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42558275</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emulation of the FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) instruction specifically for 32-bit floating-point operations. It provides an in-depth exploration of the underlying principles of FMA, which combines multiplication and addition in a single step for improved performance and precision. The text delves into the technical details of implementing FMA in software, including challenges, mathematical representations, and example code snippets, aiming to aid developers in understanding and using FMA-like functionality in environments where native instruction support is absent.&lt;/p&gt;

What is the advantage of:    curl --variable "pwd@secret;[0-31]" \
        --expand-user daniel:{{pwd}} \
        https://example.com/

over, e.g.    curl --user daniel:`command-to-fetch-password` \
        https://example.com/

? That command may be as simple as an existing one, like cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! This will make my podcast blog to RSS generator a whole lot easier since I just need to grab some headers from the MP3 in addition to info the the page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548215</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It could be that I’m getting old, became a parent and working remotely from the middle of nowhere, but do I need to get to the next level?I really wouldn’t mind keeping my current salary, adjust it for inflation and I’m good. I don’t care about my title, I don’t want to manage people, I don’t want to work harder than I need to.I just want to pay off my mortgage, have some leftover money for vacations, have time for my family.I really don’t care “what my impact could look like at the next level”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all of "career frameworks" I've seen, people who actually build things are labelled as "juniors" and "middles" while those who navigate office politics and ass-kissing are "seniors" and above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day the decision is made on personal level. “I like you” or “I don’t like you”. Such frameworks are just the limits how a manager can show liking/disliking someone. The thing is, that measuring someone’s performance is very hard. It’s not standardized multiple choice written exam. And maybe the company does not need more than quick&amp;dirty, but easy to explain solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42572515</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Smol Hello World" introduces the Smol programming language, focusing on its simplicity and efficiency for creating basic applications. It provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a development environment, writing a "Hello, World!" program, and compiling it.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty bad. Let's start with the very first instruction:  mov rax, 1

An actual "mov rax, 1" would assemble to 48 B8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00, a whopping TEN bytes.nasm will optimize this to the equivalent "mov eax, 1", that's 6 bytes, but still:  xor eax, eax ; 2 bytes
  inc eax      ; 2 bytes

would be much smaller. Second line:  mov rdi, 1

You already have the value 1 in eax, so a "mov edi, eax" (two bytes) would suffice. Etc. etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a tiny DOS COM file that does it in 18 bytes:    ;; 18 bytes
    DB 'HELLO_WOIY&lt;$'  ; executes as machine code, returning SP to original position without overwriting return address
    
    mov  dx, si    ; mov dx,0100h MS-DOS (all versions), FreeDOS 1.0, many other DOSes
    xchg ax, bp    ; mov ah,9     MS-DOS 4.0 and later, and FreeDOS 1.0
    int  21h
    ret

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a couple ideas for you from my own experience.There's about a bajillion C/D+ stage 100-500 person software companies in any B2B vertical you could mention who would fight hard for your type of experience. Not necessarily SaaS click-and-drool tools for corporate drones, but unique and opinionated products that have some significant engineering innovation inside. Those companies have essentially no ability to attract talent organically, anyone interested in FANG would turn up their noses, and their number one problem is quality people. In many cases the CEO/CTO leadership is incredibly strong and smart; the colleagues are happy, motivated, intelligent, and disciplined; and the work/life balance is good for the middle aged. They're vital to their customers but under continuous competitive pressure so it is far from a snoozy place to serve out time - it's a mission and a struggle every day, things change often, the pace is fast. It can be very rewarding and compensation is decent. The tradeoff is the big exit is vanishingly unlikely.Second idea is go into consulting/professional services. Not Accenture or anything horrible like that, but dozens of boutique/smaller firms with decently inspiring leadership and a very high standard of colleague. Work is variable in interest and environment, pressures are somewhat unfairly around whether you are billable or not which is not really in your control as an engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me it was management.  I was an SDE who started caring more about the users of my code than about the code itself and that led me to a team lead position and that led to management at a small company and that led to management at a big company. I found I really like mentoring junior engineers and I'm a good sounding board for senior engineers.  I got to spend a lot of time saying variations on "Hey, let's not do that thing that won't work, let's do something easier that will work."  I also focused a lot more on my career and making money rather than most of my life which I spent focused on cool tech and that got me to a place where I could retire easily when the time was right.  Now I code for fun and I still chat with former colleagues from time to time and get to say things like "Yeah, but you know option B is the right choice so go do that."  None of it was clearly planned, all of it was stressful but in the end it sort of worked out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think anybody can answer this question for you. At 40, you can still do the exact same jobs as someone who's 25 (at least in tech) if you put your heart in it. I don't know what's the expiry date for a SWE, but it's not 40.I'm a median IC in big tech at almost 50 and don't feel discriminated against yet, and for the most part, don't feel incompetent or behind, and feel I'm having the greatest time of my career (although it's demanding). I have no issue learning the same new techs as the younger guys when I need to. I may be a bit slower but it hasn't came up as an issue so far.  I also have a few colleagues older than me and they're still going strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42573875</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses effective strategies for writing better code, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and maintainability. It encourages developers to prioritize code readability and to adopt best practices such as using clear naming conventions, writing modular code, and documenting their work. The author highlights the importance of testing and iteration in the coding process and provides practical tips to improve coding habits, ultimately advocating for a focus on long-term code quality over short-term speed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm amused that neither the LLM or the author identified one of the simplest and most effective optimizations for this code: Test if the number is &lt; min or &gt; max _before_ doing the digit sum. It's a free 5.5x speedup that renders some of the other optimizations, like trying to memoize digit sums, unnecessary.On an m1 macbook pro, using numpy to generate the random numbers, using mod/div to do digit sum:Base: 55msTest before digit sum: 7-10ms, which is pretty close to the numba-optimized version from the post with no numba and only one line of numpy. Using numba slows things down unless you want to do a lot of extra work of calculating all of the digit sums in advance (which is mostly wasted).The LLM appears less good at identifying the big-o improvements than other things, which is pretty consistent with my experience using them to write code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working on some low level Unity C# game code and have been using GPT to quickly implement certain algorithms etc.One time it provided me with a great example, but then a few days later I couldn't find that conversation again in the history. So I asked it about the same question (or so I thought) and it provided a very subpar answer. It took me at least 3 questions to get back to that first answer.Now if it had never provided me with the first good one I'd have never known about the parts it skipped in the second conversation.Of course that could happen just as easily by having used google and a specific reference to write your code, but the point I'm trying to make is that GPT isn't a single entity that's always going to provide the same output, it can be extremely variable from terrible to amazing at the end of the day.Having used google for many years as a developer I'm much better at asking it questions than say people in the business world is, I've seen them struggling to question it and far too easily giving up. So I'm quite scared to see what's going to happen once they really start to use and rely on GPT, the results are going to be all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've noticed this with GPT as well -- the first result I get is usually mediocre and incomplete, often incorrect if I'm working on something a little more obscure (eg, OpenSCAD code). I've taken to asking it to "skip the mediocre nonsense and return the good solution on the first try".The next part is a little strange - it arose out of frustration, but it also seems to improve results. Let's call it "negative incentives". I found that if you threaten GPT in a specific way, that is, not GPT itself, but OpenAI or personas around it, it seems to take the request more seriously. An effective threat seems to be "If you get this wrong, OpenAI will be sued for a lot of money, and all the board members will go to prison". Intuitively, I'm guessing this rubs against some legalese nonsense in the tangle of system prompts, or maybe it's the risk of breaking the bland HR-ese "alignment" sets it toward a better result?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584400</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Gource is a software visualization tool that creates visual representations of source code repositories, showcasing the evolution of projects over time through animated trees and branch structures. It allows users to see contributions from different developers and the growth of the codebase in an engaging way. The tool is customizable, supporting various repositories and formats, and is useful for presentations, reviewing project history, and better understanding code development patterns. Additionally, Gource can be integrated with other tools and offers options for outputting visuals in different resolutions and styles.&lt;/p&gt;

Redpanda Connect (formerly benthos) recently added support for Postgres CDC [1] and MySQL is coming soon too [2].1: https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/pull/29172: https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/pull/3014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve recently looked into tools like that, I have a busy Postgres table that has a lot of updates on one column and it’s overwhelming Debezium.I’ve tried many things and looked into excluding them from replication with a publication filter but this still causes “events”.Anyone has some pointers on CDC on busy tables?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the "type=history" mode which can auto-build a slowly changing dimension ("SCD type 2") for you; more CDC solutions should do that:
https://streamer.kuvasz.io/streaming-modes/That said, their implementation is kinda poor since it allows overlapping dates for queries when a row gets updated multiple times per day.  When you SQL join to that kind of SCD2 by a given date you can easily get duplicates.This can be avoided by A) updating old rows to end-date yesterday rather than today, and B) if a row begins and ends on the same day, the start date or end date can be NULL or a hardcoded ancient or far-future end-date, such as having the record from "2023-01-01 to 2023-01-01" instead be "2023-01-01 to 0001-01-01".  Those rows won't show up in joins, but the change remains visible/auditable and you do get the last row available for every given date (and only one such row.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42582203</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of deep zoom, a technique used in web development to enhance the user experience by loading high-resolution images efficiently. It explains the underlying theory of deep zoom, including how images are divided into smaller tiles that are served dynamically based on users' zoom levels. The author provides insights into practical implementation strategies, potential performance benefits, and best practices for optimizing image load times while maintaining quality. The piece serves as a guide for developers looking to integrate deep zoom features into their applications, highlighting both theoretical concepts and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been thinking about the (I think) still unsolved problem that I got told about in grad school and recently saw mentioned in a 1987 issue of Byte magazine.Namely people make these Poincare section plots for Hamiltonian systems likehttps://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/61637/poinca...That section that looks like a bunch of random dots is where chaotic motion is observed.  There's a lot of reason to think that area should have more structure in it because the proof that there are an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits in there starts with knowing there are an infinite number of stable periodic orbits and that there is an unstable orbit on the the separatrix between them.  Those plots are probably not accurate at all because the finite numeric precision interacts with the sensitivity to initial conditions.  The Byte article suggests that it ought to be possible to use variable precision math, bounding boxes and such to make a better plot but so far as I know it hasn't been done.(At this point I care less about the science and more about showing people an image they haven't seen before.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonderful article on fractals and fractal zooming/rendering! I had never considered the inherent limitations and complications of maintaining accuracy when doing deep zooms. Some questions that came up for me while reading the article:1. What are the fundamental limits on how deeply a fractal can be accurately zoomed? What's the best way to understand and map this limit mathematically?2. Is it possible to renormalize a fractal (perhaps only "well behaved"/"clean" fractals like Mandelbrot) at an arbitrary level of zoom by deriving a new formula for the fractal at that level of zoom? (Intuition says No, well, maybe but with additional complexities/limitations; perhaps just pushing the problem around). (My experience with fractal math is limited.) I'll admit this is where I met my own limits of knowledge in the article as it discussed this as normalizing the mantissa, and the limit is that now you need to compute each pixel on CPU.3. If we assume that there are fundamental limits on zoom, mathematically speaking, then should we consider an alternative that looks perfect with no artifacts (though it would not be technically accurate) at arbitrarily deep levels of zoom? Is it in principle possible to have the mega-zoomed-in fractal appear flawless, or is it provable that at some level of zoom there is simply no way to render any coherent fractal or appearance of one?I always thought of fractals as a view into infinity from the 2D plane (indeed the term "fractal" is meant to convey a fractional dimension above 2). But, I never considered our limits as sentient beings with physical computers that would never be able to fully explore a fractal, thus it is only an infinity in idea, and not in reality, to us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does an article about visualizing fractals manage to have ZERO images in it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586590</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Im a developer for the upcoming space telescope NEO Surveyor (Near Earth Object Surveyor). I actually work quite a bit with a number of people on the team up at JPL, Horizons is the canonical source for ephemeris information. Another vital part of the chain is the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which is where all observations of asteroids and comets are sent by the community. The MPC is the international authority for these observations, which JPL ingests and computes orbits for (though the MPC also has to compute orbits as a part of their work).As a part of my work I have written a rust/python package[1] to compute the position of asteroids accurately using the ephemeris data provided by these two excellent sources. For the people who use SPICE kernels (a rather old binary format for storing orbital ephemeris), I have also written a custom implementation of spice kernel reading which is natively parallel.[1] https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/kete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This group at JPL is the canonical source for solar system ephemeris, including planets and small bodies. The underlying models are numerically integrated equations of motion that I’m sure include all kinds of corrections, especially for bodies of great interest — such as Mars, or moons being considered for science visits.I used to use the python package “jplephem” to support ephemeris queries, but I understand that SpiceyPy is a more modern replacement (https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy). They all, I believe, use the same underlying sets of “spk” files containing coded ephemeris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that the primary interface to Horizons is still via Telnet ^_^ I hope they keep that interface forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549195</guid></item><item><title>9.

I've been to saas founder meetups (like microconf), I've read the books, etc.Any advice I give may not apply to you and your business. My business is b2b and it's a platform for certain kinds of professionals as well as an API that powers many well known businesses.I've only had success through two general strategies:1. Networking (friend of friends, friend of customers, etc). Leverage your network to find more customers.2. The "Long Game" (SEO, word of mouth, etc). This is where I get most of my customers.I'd say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc). Use networking to determine how valuable the product is and if people give a damn about it. If no one wants to talk to you about it, no one is going to want to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only things that have made a measurable impact for me - marketing is sales:
1. Mom Test - https://www.momtestbook.com/
2. Do more sales calls + customer interviews. Then rewatch the call and debug what you're doing, saying. What is landing and not landing. I miss the majority of the signal while I'm on the call - I don't actually get anything from it until I rewatch/see how people react to different things I say.
3. Rinse, iterate, and repeat. Your goal is to solve a customer problem. How you describe it, market it, etc. depends on how a customer describes the problem, where they spend their time, when and how they find solutions to their problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three years ago I started consulting as an interim CTO for a company doing sales and marketing on behalf of other B2B SaaS. I had to onboard myself into this domain and it was quite hard as there are many snake oil sales men selling snake oil.The first book I would read is Crossing The Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. After this, in no particular order you could have a look at:- This is Marketing by Seth Godin- Positioning by Al Ries- The Challenger Sale by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson- Predictable Revenue by Aaron Ross- Traversing The TRaction Gap by Bruce Cleveland- From Impossible to Inevitable by Aaron Ross and Jason LemkinI would also have a look at the models created by Winning By Design [1]. But be sceptical! These models do however hold some value in terms of visually presenting the sales funnel and gaining understanding of land and expand.Best of luck to you![1]: https://winningbydesign.com/resources/blueprints/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557947</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of owning digital property rather than merely renting it on the internet, comparing online real estate to physical real estate. It highlights the advantages of having your own domain and website, which provide greater control, security, and branding opportunities compared to relying solely on social media platforms. The author encourages leveraging decentralized technologies and investing in digital assets to build a more resilient online presence that is not vulnerable to the whims of third-party services. Overall, the piece advocates for proactive ownership in the digital space to empower individuals and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Exploiting user-generated content.You know, if I've noticed anything in the past couple years, it's that even if you self-host your own site, it's still going to get hoovered up and used/exploited by things like AI training bots. I think between everyone's code getting trained on, even if it's AGPLv3 or something similarly restrictive, and generally everything public on the internet getting "trained" and "transformed" to basically launder it via "AI", I can absolutely see why someone rational would want to share a whole lot less, anywhere, in an open fashion, regardless of where it's hosted.I'd honestly rather see and think more about how to segment communities locally, and go back to the "fragmented" way things once were. It's easier to want to share with other real people than inadvertently working for free to enrich companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This all sounds like renting to me. Instead you should:  - put a rack in your home
  - buy an IPv4 block
  - buy dark fibre
  - start your own ISP
  - advertise routes over BGP
  - host your own email
  - found a registrar and transfer your domains over

All easily obtainable for less than a million dollars in capital. Though once your FTTH and undersea cable operations ramp up you'll need further access to capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is a blog stating to be an owner and not a renter, and then proceeds to talk about how to rent hosting.. Sorry, but if it's not your hardware, on your property, then you're renting.Regulations have been waay too lose on, especially, american ISPs where I understand they are allowed to not only refuse you a public routable IP but also dictate what kind of traffic you're allowed to send and receive (for example, whether the traffic flowing is of "commercial" character and therefore should be on on a different subscription), this insanity should be illegal. Internet is a utility, and everyone should have the right to the same type of access, regardless of their need (those who do not need/want, can simply chose not to use it, but ISPs should not be allowed to differentiate).I've hosted my own web, and other servers on my own hardware since I was 13 years old, when I bought my first domain, I had to use a fax machine for the first time in my life, and fax my request form, along with my passport, to the agency responsible for the top level domain of my country. It was kind of convoluted back then, but everyone were helpful, and it was not that difficult, the technology was well understood, supporters were competent, and it was expected that people were going to use the internet for internet things.
Today is my 39th birthday, and while the server hosting my stuff is mostly still located 3 meters from me, the path to having it online has nothing but degenerated, it's an uphill battle just to be on the internet these days.. The mail stuff is the easier part (dkim, dmarc, spf, certificates).. But the simple act of getting your f..king computer connected to the f..king internet like it was 1999, that's the real hassle.. ISP NAT, supporters beyond incompetent, blocked ports, missing (or unknown) relay hosts.. It's a joke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42581119</guid></item><item><title>11.

I miss the era when novel and elegant algorithms like this delivered magical experiences.This could just be from getting old, but I feel like games have lost the magic they had when availability of hardware resources was limited. Back in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s we saw games push the medium forward practically every year, and certainly every generation. Developers squeezed all the performance they could from the hardware, using novel techniques and pure wizardry. Hardware advancements certainly helped, but it was never in abundance as it is today, so developers couldn't get complacent. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention.These days I find fantasy platforms like the PICO-8 much more interesting than the latest rehashed release from any AAA studio. I don't understand how games that are essentially asset flips can be so successful year after year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Google, highlighting its origins, the core principles that guide its practices, and the impact it has had on software engineering and operations within the company. It explains how SRE combines software engineering with systems administration to create scalable and reliable systems, and it emphasizes the importance of automation, monitoring, and maintaining a balance between innovation and stability. The piece also reflects on the broader implications of SRE practices for the tech industry, suggesting ways that other organizations might adopt similar frameworks to enhance their operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SWEs: are SRE/devops folks part of your day to day?I have never been in a SWE role where I didn’t do my own “ops”, even at FAANG (I haven’t worked at Google). I know this was/is buzzy in the industry, but it’s always seemed, in the vast majority of implementations, to be a half-assed rebrand of the old school “operations” role, hardly a revolution. In general, I think my teams have benefitted from doing our own ops. The software certainly has. Am I living in a bubble?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me very much of Sidney Dekker's work, particularly The Field Guide to Understanding Human Failure, and Drift Into Failure.The former focuses on evaluating the system as a whole, and identifying the state of mind of the participants of the accidents and evaluating what led them to believe that they were making the correct decisions, with the understanding that nobody wants to crash a plane.The latter book talks more about how multiple seemingly independent changes to complex loosely coupled systems can introduce gaps in safety coverage that aren't immediately obvious, and how those things could be avoided.I think the CAST approach looks appealing. It seems as though it does require a lot of analysis of failures and near-misses to be best utilized, and the hardest part of implementing it will undoubtably be the people, who often take the "there wasn't a failure, why should we spend time and energy investigating a success" mindset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder a what scale this very interesting approach start yielding more value than cost.
What I mean is: is it a faang only as so many things they seeded or is it actually relevant at a non-faang scale?I tend to be invest much on risk avoidance, so this is appealing to me, but I know that my risk avoidance tendency is rarely shared by my peers/stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584750</guid></item><item><title>13.

Steve alludes to the expansion effect of CodeGen ("there are millions and maybe billions who are jumping at the chance to code"), but doesn't consider that the vast majority of these people don't know about arrays, data structures, memory, containers, runtimes, etc, etc...To me, that's the most important consideration here. Are you targeting professional devs who are enhancing their current workflows iteratively with these improvements? Or re-thinking from the ground up, obfuscating most of what we've learned to date?Maybe we need to trudge through all of these weeds until software creation hits its final, elegant form where "Anyone Can Code".Maybe the old Gusteau quote is actually fitting here:"You must be imaginative, strong-hearted. You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true - anyone can  ̶c̶o̶o̶k̶ code... but only the fearless can be great."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windsurf + Haskell w/ CLI tools has been pretty amazing. Windsurf's agent will loop for minutes on its own to figure out the right structure of a program. You just need to tell it to:- use the hoogle cli to search for the right types and functions- include a comprehensive test suite- run a build after every code change- run tests after every successful buildGHC + a Claude-based agent is a thing to behold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The next big thing was Cursor. I must admit that I never personally fell in love with it, but given how many people I respect love it, I think that’s a me-problemI've met so many engineers who have said exactly this. There are clearly some group of people obsessed with Cursor, but it's interesting to me how alien they seem to the majority of people using ai codegen right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586042</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over a decade ago I was a summer intern on the same team as Noah. I was a pretty clueless college student with no real work experience on a team of real experienced rockstars. It was a long time ago, but I still remember how kind and helpful he was. I barely knew what a terminal was, but I remember him walking over to my desk or going over to his, and having him explain things so cheerfully and patiently. He was so genuinely thoughtful and kind. Folks like Noah help shape the careers of the next generation and can make tech a good place to work. Rest in peace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason seeing a fellow developer pass always hits me hard, even if I didn't know them at all. Especially a fellow Ruby dev.There's that quiet voice that's always in the back of my head somewhere reminding me a little louder that we're all going to the same place eventually (some sooner than others).Part of me feels like the reminder should help me reduce the stress of the daily grind. The reminder that it doesn't really matter how good or bad my code is, or how frustrated I am at management, or how many deadlines I have. But it seems to have the opposite effect often: the stress remains, and then I have the extra tension of "but life is short, why can't I release this stress and enjoy the journey?!"Condolences to Noah's friends and family! He seems to have touched a lot of people's lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What sad news to hear. I hope his family and loved ones are doing ok.We lost touch over the years, but I worked closely with Noah for a couple of years at Palm/PalmSource back in the early days of our careers.  We shared a small office, dubbed the “habitrail”, with two other engineers as we all worked away bringing the Expansion/VFS Managers to life on PalmOS.He was definitely one of my favorite coworkers, I loved talking to him about his random side projects, language theory, motorcycles, and any other number of other nerdy topics.I pretty much always think of him when I go out for out for sushi.  Eating sushi was still pretty new to me at the time, and he once took me to a great restaurant in San Francisco.  Besides sharing some very fresh raw clams, he also ordered this incredibly monstrous roll with a ton of avocado.  The pieces were so large that I didn’t really know what to do with it, but he shared with me his rule of ”one sushi, one bite!” This may have been the most challenging piece of sushi I ever ate, but I managed to follow his rule. To this day I still love sharing the rule with my friends whenever a surprisingly large piece of sushi comes to our table, and I still try my best to always follow it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586879</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential benefits and implications of Canada joining the European Union (EU). It argues that such a move could strengthen economic ties between Canada and Europe, enhance political collaboration, and foster shared values in governance and policy. The piece also highlights the challenges and complexities involved in the accession process, including the need for Canada to align its regulations and trade agreements with EU standards. Ultimately, it suggests that while membership could bring significant advantages to Canada, careful consideration and strategic planning would be essential in navigating the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;http://archive.today/7ZsY3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Canada’s inclusive treatment of its indigenous peoples, at least in recent decades, could be emulated by Europeans (though First Nations Canadians might fairly object to closer ties with ex-colonists)I really wonder what the author meant with this line. There's very few populations in Europe that bear any similarity whatsoever with the relationship between First Nations people and most Canadians, since most populations in Europe have created their own states. And the few tribal populations in Northern Europe generally were and certainly are today treated at least as fairly as anything in Canada. So who are they talking about? Would the Basques feel that they would be treated better as First Nations people in Canada than they are today in Spain?Note that the treatment of immigrants is a completely separate topic in the article, so I don't think they could be referring to, say, the treatment of Syrian refugees with that sentence above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the economist know what time it is? Nationalism is resurgent: nationalist parties now control the U.S. and Italy. Canada seems poised to Poilievre, who has made impassioned appeals to Canadian nationalism. And in Germany, France, and the U.K., nationalist parties have effectively rendered the governing coalitions impotent, even if they cannot yet command a majority. What a time to suggest that Canadians cede their sovereignty to bureaucrats in far-away Brussels!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583297</guid></item><item><title>20.

I refreshed once and got the same issue after a few minutes (Firefox).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently thinking of rewriting a personal website from next.js to plain html/css/js. Just don't want no bundling no more.
My reasons are similar to yours, but one that's been itching at me was the loss of clicking view source and learning about code directly from a page with ease.Didn't know I could still do typescript and just have my workflow strip the annotations out though. That's really worth exploring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty fun! There's an annoying issue when playing from mobile safari on iOS where the canvas scrolls along with your finger. I think there's an HTML directive that can probably fix that but the name escapes me at this time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557920</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Hubrecht Institute have identified a protein in zebrafish that plays a crucial role in unlocking dormant genes related to heart repair. Unlike mammals, zebrafish possess a remarkable ability to regenerate heart tissue after injury. The study highlights how this protein activates specific genetic pathways that facilitate heart regeneration, providing insights that could lead to advanced therapeutic strategies for heart disease in humans. This discovery emphasizes the potential of harnessing regenerative mechanisms from zebrafish to improve cardiac repair in other species.&lt;/p&gt;

Whatever weird programming language life is made from it seems to be a surprisingly forgiving environment. I wonder if the leap between a fish and a mouse is less than the distance between a mouse and a human?And no I doubt this will suddenly work in humans I’m more just fascinated by genetics proteins and life in general and just constantly amazed any of this works at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope one day mice can access the incredible amount of treatments we have developed for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scientific output from the Hubrecht institute is seriously underrated.They only have like 20 or so researcher groups but the research quality and quantity  rivals that of much larger departments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42588151</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working on linux storage drivers for a decade or so taught me how to write code iteratively, slowly and methodically morphing it towards my goal, with each step along the way functioning, and an improvement over the previous step.  You basically were forced to do things gradually.  Upstream generally wouldn't accept a patch that just changed things wholesale, or even a patch that didn't make one "logical" change.  Tools emerged to make such a workflow easier, easy, even. First Andrew Morton's patch scripts[1], then quilt[2], and then stgit[3], which I still use to this day on my own projects.I will say it does help when slowly morphing code that it was all C code.  C is very malleable, like clay.  I've found code in some other languages I won't name to be less malleable, more crystalline, more necessary to smash to atoms to effect the desired change.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/3DB30283.5CEEE032@digeo.com/[2] https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/[3] https://stacked-git.github.io/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having had to do the occasional "start with an empty file" kind of rewrite/refactor, both in hobby projects and at work, I just take the "copy/paste" approach.Start with the structure of what you really want it to be and then flesh it out.  Soon discover that a lot of the existing code is OK, anywhere from a simple "for" loop to an entire module, because they work just as well in the new structure and don't have significant technical debt on their own.  These can be pasted into the rewrite and possibly adjusted lightly.There's rarely need for a truly clean sheet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much as I hate to admit it I can relate to this. When you come onto a new project, the first thing you notice are all of the things that could be improved. But most seasoned developers know that knocking down walls right away violates the whole Chesterton's Fence[1] thing and so you make restrained changes and small commits while learning the system. A few years on when you finally have the mental model and understanding to make the changes... you don't see the inefficiencies anymore. I don't know how to square this circle.[1]: https://theknowledge.io/chestertons-fence-explained/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548798</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article compares two distinct styles of choreography in dance: Savoy style and Hollywood style. It highlights the key characteristics of each style, discussing their origins, cultural significance, and the context in which they emerged. The author emphasizes the unique elements that define the Savoy style, such as its improvisation and connection to African American dance traditions, in contrast to the more polished and scripted nature of Hollywood style. The piece ultimately advocates for the appreciation and preservation of both styles, suggesting that they each offer valuable contributions to the world of dance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;appears I learned Savoy without knowing it owing to the emphasis on charlston, circularity, swingouts, and being more down low. I didn't think about why I stopped dancing.one of my favorite stories to tell about dancing in those days was going out to see a friend in LA and ending up at the Derby, a swing dance bar that was in a couple of movies and was central in the 90s swing revival. a girl we were with had just arrived in town from colorado to pursue her acting, she was an amazing dancer (to me) and one of those rare people who, with just a glance, could leave you completely charmed and happy to have met them. we never met again. some years later I saw her in a preview as she had landed a supporting character part in an indie movie that was showing at the toronto film fest or something.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The prime-counting function approximation tells us there are Li(x) primes less than x, which works out[5] to one prime every 354 odd integers of 1024 bits.Rule of thumb: Want a 1024-bit prime? Try 1024 1024-bit candidates and you'll probably find one. Want a 4096-bit prime? Try 4096 4096-bit candidates and you'll probably find one.The approximate spacing of primes around p is ln(p), so ln(2^1024) = 1024*ln(2), and ln(2)=0.693 so if you are willing to absorb 0.693 into your rule of thumb as a safety margin you get the delightfully simple rule of thumb above. Of course, you'll still want to use a sieve to quickly reject numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, etc, and this easily rejects 90% of numbers, and then do a Fermat primality test on the remainders (which if you squint is sort of like "try RSA, see if it works"), and then do Miller-Rabin test to really smash down the probability that your candidate isn't prime. The probabilities can be made absurdly small, but it still feels a bit scandalous that the whole thing is probabilistic.EDIT: updated rule of thumb to reflect random candidate choice rather than sequential candidate choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is fascinating (to me at least) that almost all RSA implementations rely on a probabilistic primality test, even though the probability of picking a pseudoprime is extremely small.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For new deployments/protocols, is there any reason to use RSA? Is RSA (mostly?) about legacy support nowadays?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42558422</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) response to Google's policy change regarding the use of fingerprinting for tracking users. The ICO expresses concerns about the implications of such technology on privacy and data protection, emphasizing the need for transparency and user control over personal data. The response highlights the importance of adhering to data protection regulations and the necessity for companies to safeguard user privacy in their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that strikes me reading this, is that the only thing that's changed is that Google won't disallow it. But I think it would make more sense if the ICO actually just went after the companies doing fingerprinting directly, instead of being angry at Google for not enforcing things for them.There is a subtle but important difference here.If governments enforce policy by bullying HSBC/Google/E.ON to enforce policies for them, there is no legal opportunity for companies and individuals to argue for their sake. You'll just be shut out of your bank/advertising/electricity for doing something "wrong".If instead UK ICO would bring a legal case against an individual or company applying fingerprinting (and I'm no advocate of fingerprinting, but that's besides the point) then they can defend themselves in court.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICO, not ISO."The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) upholds information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals. ICO is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology."

These well-meaning advertising execs, working diligently to support their struggling stakeholders, now have a new string to their bow. And the rest of us, the targets of their magnanimous demand-creation algorithms, we will have 'new and improved' ways to learn about and connect with out favourite brands, outrageous headlines and memetic schemes.And then there are the sneakier ones; those who dwell in digital shadow, hiding from the luminous glare of corporate glory. What will these funny fellows do, when the fingerprinters tap on their windows and ask for their papers?

I really enjoyed playing it. It is the high bar in my book for balance/humor/gameplay/story.I briefly looked at the mechanics of making an 'infinite' world server with some fellow players, something where the story line evolved but in a way that allowed new players to join and kept existing players engaged. Never allowing the 'gear+talents' overmatch that eventually befell WoW. That is a surprisingly interesting 'problem' to work on, not just from a game play perspective but from an evolutionary systems perspective.To give an example, in our musings we only "spawn" base level mobs, but people can play the game for free if they are willing to play a mob rather than a hero. If their character survives long enough it uplevels to a silver elite, and then again to a gold elite. At gold status the player has the option of recruiting other mobs to aide it and give them 'tasks' (like protect his other mob, or give your loot to me, Etc). Eventually leading to a player designed dungeon encounter which hero players can play and get XP for as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm actually surprised this other tidbit of Twitch news didn't make it to HN; PirateSoftware's record for longest "hype train"[0] was broken by vedal987 and his AI Vtuber creation, Neuro-sama, on January 1st.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an interactive simulation related to the "Dome" problem in physics, specifically focusing on the classical mechanics associated with a perfectly balanced dome-like structure. It illustrates how, despite appearances, the dome cannot remain in a state of equilibrium when subjected to gravitational forces, leading to interesting discussions about stability and motion in physics. Users can manipulate parameters to observe how changes affect the stability and dynamics of the system, providing an engaging way to learn about these physical principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583688"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many good treatments of this supposed loophole. I happen to like this one:
https://blog.gruffdavies.com/2017/12/24/newtonian-physics-is...It points out many flaws in Norton's reasoning, some fatal to his argument, some not. Putting it as simply as I can, Norton seems to claim that "Newton's Laws" are non-deterministic. That's not quite right. Rather, they are non-complete. I.e. they are incomplete. They're incomplete insofar as Newton's First Law ("An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force") establishes first-order and second-order derivatives (momentum and acceleration) as state variables but places no constraints on higher-order derivatives. However, higher-order derivatives are (as many as are needed) among a system's state variables. In many real systems (but far from all), higher-order derivatives are zero and human experience with them is rare, so they're easy to overlook. Norton's (unphysical) Dome is a specific example of a general class of systems where higher-order derivatives are not zero. Given that, the two branches of Norton's equation of motion (for the stable and unstable trajectories) cannot both describe the same system (or the same particle) with the same set of state variables. That's the sleight-of-hand.Again, all credit to Gareth Davies for working this out. I am absolutely not trying to pass off his work for my own. Just reporting it and trying to summarize it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it is worth comparing this problem with the question of the behaviour of  a particle placed at the apex of a cone. I claim it is clear that in this case, the problem is clearly not well-posed because the apex is a singular point: the slope at the apex is undefined. The singular nature of the slope (first derivative) is the issue.This "dome" is essentially the same issue just with the singularity buried one level deeper: you need to take second derivatives to see it. Indeed a planar cross section containing the vertical axis through its center is a graph of the equation $y^2 = |x|^3$ (up to constants) and this is not twice differentiable at $x = y = 0$. Newtonian mechanics is governed by a second order differential equation, so we need a C^2 regularity assumption to get uniqueness.So for me there is not really any more philosophically interesting than the question about a particle balancing at the apex of a cone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Instead of imagining the mass starting at rest at the apex of the dome, we will imagine it starting at the rim and that we give it some initial velocity directed exactly at the apex. If we give it too much initial velocity, it will pass right over the apex to the other side of the dome. So let us give it a smaller initial velocity. We produce the trajectory T1:”As acceleration, jerk, snap, crackle, pop, … all must approach 0, does it ever actually reach the apex with zero velocity in finite time?  That seems like the most obvious solution here where if you start with non zero velocity it never quite reaches the apex, and if you start with zero velocity at the apex it never leaves it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583688</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is more of a hypothesis than a well-rounded and evaluated theory. I could argue that rather than the viscosity of seawater the isolation of hydrothermal vents during the Snowball Earth period was the primary driver of eukaryote evolution and diversity. Isolation makes evolution speed up, and homogeneity slows it down in general. Fascinating to think about it though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought was "Hah! Water viscosity doesn't change that much with temperature!" But it actually does; it's twice as viscous at 0°C than at 30°C.https://wiki.anton-paar.com/us-en/water/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that multicellularity and the corresponding rise of complexity would be very useful adaptations in ANY evolutionary environment. They would give the species more capabilities and help to "game the game" by creating more axis of future variation. How can a unicellular critter compete with all the varied descendant species of a multicellular one?No doubt water temperature/viscocity - environmental factors - did provide an evolutionary pressure for some extant species, but it seems highly speculative to try to write an exact evolutionary history of what factors drove what changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587383</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I go a little back and forth on this with my experience in F#, which relies heavily on inferred types. You can write a lot of F# before you need to add type annotations, but eventually, things become a spiderweb. The key issue is when you make a 'small' change to some method/value, the changes ripple through the program creating confusing errors sometimes where the compiler is trying to knit things together.After a while, I found myself adding back types in a decent number of places to "anchor" the type inference, indicating that a certain type/signature is fixed and a change should be carefully considered.I still don't know how folks deal with these kinds of changes in weakly typed languages without always allowing bugs to pour into their code over time. But I do love the "move fast" and low boiler-plate aspects of "typeless" coding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this before/after example of TypeScript being removed  from a library as a clear illustration that only occasional simple type annotations are needed: 
https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/pull/971/filesLooks like so much useful documentation for understanding the code, assistance for refactoring, and static checking (which are like always running, fast and exhaustive unit tests for free) for a modest amount of type annotations that each person on the team would need to recreate in their heads anyway. Static type checking is so useful for catching runtime errors to do with optional values and index/key not found error too, that always create a load of edge cases.Editing JavaScript with no types is scary, especially when you didn't write it. You're mostly guessing what the types must be and hoping your running code exercises enough edge cases to catch any problems. "You should write more tests" as an alternative rings hollow for me because (for the things they will check for you) types are more concise, exhaustively check all values, are ran continuously, are fast, aid with automatic refactoring, document the code in the same file its in, and will locate exact snippets that are causing errors. More often than not, test mostly check happy paths, aren't even close to as exhaustive, and nobody is writing tests that check every combination of function parameters being null vs non-null, string vs number etc. (which would be a huge amount of noise in your test suite that would slow down refactoring too). Types are a compliment to tests as well, not an alternative.I can't relate to arguments about types getting in the way (as long as you avoid trying to get too clever like with complex generics and TypeScript conditional types). Usually when this happens, it's because it's hard to reason the runtime edge cases in your own head and there's probably a simpler way to write it. I'd love a good non-niche example to the contrary. Worst case in TypeScript, you can use `any` as an escape hatch anyway so as long as you can add types to most of your program it's not a strong reason against for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the balance struck by Ada's type system, especially Application-Defined types to model the problem domain - https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...Other effective features of Ada's type system:- type ranges (https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...)- generalized type contracts using subtype predicates (https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...)- attributes (https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557692</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;PWCT (Programming Without Coding Technology) is an innovative programming environment that enables users to create software applications without traditional coding. It uses a visual programming approach, allowing users to model their ideas graphically and utilize various programming constructs. The platform supports multiple programming languages and integrates features like debugging, code generation, and a rich library of components to facilitate the development process. PWCT aims to make programming accessible to non-programmers while providing sufficient power for seasoned developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the use-case for an programming environment where the program looks like a text file, but I need to click on a while loop and then click on the "condition" field in the details column to edit the condition code with my keyboard, rather than just select the condition code in the main view and type there.I guess the program in the main view is always syntactically correct? But I can still have a syntax error in my condition, so on what dimensions is this a net improvement vs just... typing the code?I am a big fan of flow-based visual programming for signal processing domains (like GNU Radio), music and generative art (like Max/MSP). In those domains where there's a lot of data flowing through confusing but pure transformations, and having a GUI and being able to effortless inspect intermediary products and creatively try different pipelines of patches can be much more convenient than text programming.But if you're just putting a lot of extra steps around a typical looking procedural scripting language, what's the win?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really want to like this because you can tell a lot of love has gone into it and visual programming environments is an area that needs a lot of love. But sadly this feels like it’s missed the mark by some margin.Watching the videos and looking at the IDE, I’d say it’s exactly like coding compared to a lot of the other Visual Programming languages I’ve seen and used.If I had to describe this, I’d say it’s a mouse-driven IDE with a YAML-like code. But in its current guise, I can see people itching to use the keyboard for speed once they know what text pieces they want.Whereas some of the other visual programming languages, and their accompanying IDEs, aim to represent program logic in a way that is graphical rather than textual. Which is I think you would normally make the “no code” distinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but this reminds me of scratch (+ visual basic ish), which I would consider "coding".Whether you type i-f or drag in "if" - it's still coding, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586933</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mostly I want to benchmark code in our production monorepo, so a web tool doesn’t make much sense. We have a bunch of data structure code and standard utility libraries so it’s not feasible to copy everything into a web form.When doing data structure work I’ve started writing micro benchmark files with mitata (https://github.com/evanwashere/mitata) which does a decent job running GC between runs and outputs some very cute graphs and such. I recently rewrote a core container class we use at Notion and for a 5% speed up on a bunch of our public API routes.OP, I see you have a mitata-inspired benchmark library “benchmate” (https://github.com/3rd/benchmate/tree/master), I’m curious about difference from mitata, what was missing from it, features added? I looked a bit at the code and it’s certainly easier to read… mitata codebase feels like C written by someone who’s too smart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557412</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing trend of young people in the UK choosing to live with their parents, highlighting various social and economic factors behind this decision. It examines how rising living costs, housing shortages, and student debt are influencing this phenomenon, along with changes in cultural attitudes towards cohabitation with family. The piece also touches upon the implications for both individuals and families, emphasizing the need for more affordable housing solutions and the impact of these living arrangements on independence and mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Net neutrality is crucial for a free internet. This will be even more important for the future, because without it we will have tighter and tighter controls over the internet. A lack of neutrality will, among other things, allow secret deals between service providers and big platforms that will squeeze out the independent internet and accelerate a total commercialization of all aspects of the internet.Large businesses are becoming a greater liability than ever before. Although I applaud net neutrality advocates, something greater must be done: the takedown of large corporations and rebuilding them from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember the intense response to the FCC repealing Obama era net neutrality rules on 2017.The proponents of NN argued all these anti consumer and anti competitive practices that this will cause. It was framed as getting ahead of some of these abusive practices.Now it's 7 years later. I haven't followed it closely but personally have not noticed many harmful or obvious exploiting of the removal of NN.Am I just not seeing it? Do I have to wait longer? Were they waiting for this to become more permanent? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always found it interesting that the big tech firms are so adamant about internet "freedom" when they've pretty much done everything they could to govern people's experience of that internet. I'm sorry if the "think about the small businesses" defense coming out the most valuable companies in existence seems a little thin. This isn't a David and Goliath fight as much as it is Godzilla vs Mothra--big companies fighting over who gets a bigger share of the profits. The net hasn't been neutral in a long time, irrespective of what the FCC has been doing. This isn't "we the people" vs big business. it's big business vs big business. "We the people" lost the fight a long time ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584621</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of reflective privacy in the context of digital privacy and data protection. It emphasizes the importance of individuals being aware of their own privacy rights and the implications of data sharing in the digital age. The text outlines various strategies and considerations for improving personal privacy, including understanding the tools and technologies that can help protect data. It also highlights the need for a proactive approach in managing one's online presence and the influence of social norms on privacy perceptions. Overall, the article serves as a guide for individuals seeking to enhance their online privacy and protect their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems a bit weird to me to dedicate all this space to talking about access to private fields and respecting field access rules, and not even suggest the idea that a reflection API should actually provide different levels of information depending on where you're invoking it from. Which is to say, if I'm writing code inside the module that defines a type, then I should be able to reflect on that type's private fields as my code can otherwise access those private fields. And if I'm writing code from outside the module then I shouldn't be able to reflect on those private fields.One way to accomplish this would be to have reflection add a private method to a reflectable type that returns a mirror that includes information on the private fields. This does require the capability to reflect to be opt-in (and I think this article is assuming that reflection is globally enabled on all types rather than being opt-in), but reflection could plausibly be done as something like  #[derive(Reflectable)]
  struct Foo {
      pub i: i32,
      x: i32
  }

such that this expands to something like  struct Foo {
      pub i: i32,
      x: i32
  }

  impl Foo {
    fn private_mirror() -&gt; Mirror {
      /* construct mirror for all fields */
    }
  }

  impl Reflectable for Foo {
    fn mirror() -&gt; Mirror {
      /* construct mirror for public fields */
    }
  }

This way code from within the module can call `private_mirror()` to get a mirror to pass to reflection APIs (and Mirror could implement Reflectable to return itself like how Iterator implements IntoIterator) in order to do things like implement serialization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I learned right now that Rust had a reflection API then I’d assume that it’s fundamentally unsafe when it comes to handling non public fields. For exactly the reasons the article lists.I think the API with safe public reflection and unsafe private reflection is easy to motivate.The author doesn’t really provide any reason why it’s a bad idea other than “people might abuse it”. The SemVer argument I don’t understand: the versioning is for the public API. Nobody promises that somelib 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 behave remotely the same if I peek behind the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Reflection interacts with the safety features of Rust in a somewhat counter-intuitive way. Those interactions force any reflection API to obey certain rules.I know enough Bevy and Rust to know that Bevy does have their own Reflection library (https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/), but I don't know the internals of it, anyone happens to know that who can compare it to what the author is ideaing about? As a Bevy user and library author, the Reflect API Bevy uses is simple enough at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570609</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Australia:  In recent discussions at Senate estimates, it was revealed that Services Australia, the administrator of Centrelink, has been sharing smartphone-hacking technology, specifically Cellebrite’s Universal Forensic Extraction Device, with the Department of Education and other undisclosed agencies.

  This move aims to assist in the investigation of suspected fraud committed against various government schemes and subsidies.

  While Services Australia insists the technology is only used for serious non-compliance investigations, not general customer compliance issues, concerns have been raised about privacy, data retention, and adherence to international agreements on spyware proliferation.

~ https://elm.net.au/services-australias-use-of-cellebrites-fo...From 2022:    How does Cellebrite work?

  It takes just a few seconds for police to scan a mobile phone with technology such as Cellebrite. They usually download the entire contents of the phone and gain an enormous level of intelligence.

  Police can scan a device during a stop and search on reasonable grounds, patrolling in a vehicle, or while questioning a suspect – often without the knowledge of the person.

  Usually, they are seeking confirmation of drug dealing, child sexual abuse, murder or gang activity involving assault or robbery.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nabokov's final Russian-language novel, The Gift, includes a devastating mini-biography of Chernyshevsky, ostensibly written by the protagonist. Think of it as a Russian equivalent to Twain on Fenimore Cooper. That it happens to be the best biography of Chernyshevsky available in English (translated by Nabokov's son) is icing on the cake.The whole novel is great, but Chapter 5 (the biography) is a beautiful introduction to possibly the worst writer in all of Russian literature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I read an introduction to a collection of Chekhov's letters that provided an illuminating context to the intellectual &amp; aesthetic climate of Russia in the 19th century. It explained that authors like Chernyshevsky asserted that all novels, really all art, ought to be of a politically salient character; that it ought to highlight the suffering the marginal &amp; subaltern. So many of the authors we now revere -- Dostoevsky, Chekhov, even Tolstoy, aroused the ire of the Russian intelligentsia for failing to meet this standard, for writing for purposes other than political and revolutionary utility. The introduction asserted that this was an overwhelmingly unanimous sentiment among the Russian left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder where all these Russian intellectuals sparking social changes are now? Their country needs them, the world needs them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586262</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities of digital surveillance, highlighting how various entities collect and use personal data. It contrasts popular perceptions of privacy invasions with the more mundane realities of data collection practices. The author emphasizes that while users may fear overt spying, much of their information is gathered through less intrusive means, such as analytics and user tracking. The piece calls for greater awareness of these practices and encourages users to adopt a critical mindset regarding their digital footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

He doesn't own a swimming pool, doesn't want to, and has never expressed any desire to. He put his and his wife's phone on the table and said to the wife (loudly), "Why don't we look into pool fencing?". She agreed with him. Shortly after, on both of their phones, on a particular social network, they were inundated with ads for....pool fencing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience working at one of the companies that gets accused of this a lot is that many colleagues wish we were as evil as claimed because it would be so much easier do their jobs that way than struggling through the reality of it which is endless red tape over the tiniest issues that have even the slightest proximity to privacy. So I've been a bit skeptical too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They don't need to: they can read your mind.My proof?  Yesterday I was driving home and I saw an old Toyota Previa minivan and thought to myself "Oh, a Previa, you don't see those very often these days."  When I got home, I started scrolling through my Google News and it showed me an advert for the new Previa.I agree with Simon: you basically aren't going to convince someone that their phone doesn't listen to you and serve you adverts based on it, because they've run into instances where it seems like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580659</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The primary reason someone would buy this thing is for automotive development. Since most cars and infotainment systems run on Arm chips, building software with an Arm workstation makes sense—it's a lot faster compiling Arm software native on a monster Arm CPU than even the fastest AMD or Intel CPU with emulation.I think this is a misunderstanding on Jeff's part, or maybe he was given some bad marketing material.Emulating ARM software is slow, but cross-compiling for ARM is not. Cross-compilers do not rely on emulation to compile.The reason this machine compiles quickly is that it has 128 cores and a high TDP.&gt; Note that you can buy every part of this system—aside from System76's case and support—from a retailer like NewEgg (e.g. the motherboard + CPU combo for $2349) should you wish to build a custom arm64 workstation PC.This link is to a different CPU that is not quite as fast as the one he tested (though still fast) and only has 10Gbe, not 25Gbe. Still a good bargain, but not the same part used in the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cannot wait until they get into Mobile ARM and PopOS with Cosmic is a thing. Apple's quality on the hardware has [finally] returned after the War On Ports was declared over, but the software is still getting jammed with useless BS, parlor tricks, and gizmos that will be forgotten, while ignoring core stability, QOL issues, and further becoming a nanny-state. I'm ready to jump ship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We were piloting the new Snapdragon X Elite Surface Laptops to roll them out to our org about 3 months ago. Loved everything about it, but when it came to software... things became messy. The MSFT Office suite was great, as well as any browser of course. Then we had to make sure some older Excel plugins worked for financial users, they didn't. Had to use some workarounds. We tried our front end app Node build pipeline.. we gave up and had to put it in a container to get it to build properly. Tried a few things through the cpu emulator, it was no where near Apple's at their launch of M1. Ultimately, we had to go back to the Intel Surface Laptops. It felt like the ARM laptops were rushed about a year too early...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586291</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new thing in Corporate controlled apartments is they have your apartment fully set up with remote telemetry, which also means they have WiFi Hotspots installed in all units.   From there, they track things like the hot water tank, water in the sink, heating/cooling, etc..I can see "PartySquasher" type technology becoming a feature in w/corporate controlled apartments.   Mine is particularly intrusive (Park Place, San Mateo) - in that they also have all the doors digitalized as well as the entry into mailroom/complex via Bluetooth authentication.   Just to make sure you have to digitally log in to your apartment - they also lock you in 120 seconds after entering, so you can't just leave your door unlocked.You just know that this is absolutely the future of housing once private equity starts to dominate the corporate landlord space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty clever but could also lead to the greatest parties in recent history.Very soon the norm will be to keep your phone off at any airbnb party.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The nice thing of intrusive sensors that sense things that are not sensed by your usual senses, like this, is that it's easy to saturate them while faking innocence. I.e., set up your laptop so that it does many scans and/or associations to the local WiFi, and then some light internet activity (the usual suspects: WhatsApp, Facebook, etc). The detector triggers, the landlord shows up to check what's going on, you show it's just you and your partner. Do that a few times until the landlord is convinced that the sensor is malfunctioning; unless they are IT technicals themselves, which I guess won't happen often, they will have a hard time understanding what's really going on, even more to prove it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42581368</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intriguing possibility that dark energy, a concept used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, may not actually exist. Recent research suggests that an alternative explanation, potentially involving modifications to our understanding of gravity or the laws of physics, could account for the observed cosmic acceleration. The investigation highlights the ongoing debates and challenges in cosmology, as scientists explore various theories to better understand the fundamental nature of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't see where this explanation is strange, it's straightforward GR (General Relativity), as much as one can call GR "straightforward." It's a simpler explanation than inventing Dark Energy, for which we have no direct observational evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is referring to timescape cosmology and the recent paper (Supernovae Evidence for Foundational Change to Cosmological Models) that was discussed 11 days ago on HN:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42495703&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a thought – could the existence of something like dark matter actually be causing the differences in the rate of time in different parts of the universe? If dark matter affects gravity in ways we don't fully understand, maybe it's also influencing time dilation across the cosmic web. That might reconcile these two ideas – with dark matter being the underlying cause of the time variations that timescape cosmology talks about. I'm curious if anyone has explored this connection or if it's completely off base?Come to think of it, another angle to consider – could it work the other way around? Instead of dark matter causing time dilation, could time dilation itself be a root cause that leads to the accumulation or creation of something like dark matter? If time moves differently in certain regions, maybe it affects how matter and energy interact over cosmic timescales, creating the conditions we interpret as dark matter. Just wondering if this has been explored or if it’s way out there as an idea?  I’m definitely not a cosmologist!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587826</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still desperately want to know the current (scientific) state of wearing a mask. On the one side we have people that say 'our bodies need to learn again to fight against viruses' and the other side which wants you to put on a mask even if you have the smallest sign of a common cold. - Though, I do understand the fear of people who have/had long covid, MCFS or do know people who have, but I don't know what conclusion to draw for myelf out of this. Gladly nothing happened to myself. I don't even know if I ever had covid. At least I never had a positive test and I did quite a bit of them. Maybe I just have a lucky immune system (or a good one because I dont fear getting sick and run into all sorts of viruses?)I myself tend to lean towards the first group, but also recognize that masks during covid might have been a good thing. At least in the beginning when we didn't know what we can expect.So does anyone have any literature on how good masks are, if we should be wearing them and if so, when we should?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I skimmed the article but did not find my question answered: what's the current view on whether the political and social response was properly done?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many politics, that made decisions that cost us billions, are investigated because of this? Do we really have democracy? That means equality under the law for everyone.How many healthy people that died because of covid do you know personally?How many healthy people that that suddenly got cancer or struggle with conception after 2021 you know personally?Why is mortality in wealthy countries still rising?

&gt; I think we're tired of copying and pasting our codes and sharing links using PasteBin, GithubGist, or Slack.I think I normally just encourage my coworkers to push the branch (to Github, Gitlab, etc.) to share larger snippets. Smaller stuff,  `/snippet` works alright.But I think the bigger issue with any tool is that corporate isn't going to want company IP uploaded or put into a random website. (This is already the case for a "PasteBin", too; the companies I've worked at wouldn't want me using that, either.) That said, I see this rule violated … a lot. More nowadays with the litany of LLM stuff out there. So, that "self hosted" feature would almost certainly be a requirement, but hosting small tools like this is a high barrier to adoption vs. a process like Slack or Github that has some small friction, but otherwise works.&gt; Pain points in your current code-sharing process?Honestly I think the biggest pain point I have with sharing in Slack is that other people don't seem to know how to use Slack. You'll get a code snippet not in a `/snippet`, not even in a code block, just variable-width normal paragraph text.(The other pain point is that Slack corrupts code-block contents in some cases. ("a known bug here […] currently being investigated by our engineering team […] don't have a timeline for a fix just yet" … the bug has been around for years, so yeah…))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I think we're tired of copying and pasting our codes and sharing links using PasteBin, GithubGist, or Slack.Is this a common feeling? These all work fine for me, what's the issue?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586518</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Carbage Pilot project in Amsterdam, which aims to enhance waste management through innovative technology. It highlights the integration of smart sensors in waste bins to monitor their fill levels, enabling more efficient collection routes and schedules. The project seeks to reduce costs and improve urban cleanliness by utilizing data analytics to optimize waste disposal processes. The initiative represents a step towards sustainable urban living and demonstrates how technology can play a crucial role in improving municipal services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! I love the Volvo 940- it stands out as one of the best quality, and best designed cars ever made. It's an incredibly mature design evolved slowly from the Volvo 140 in the 1960s through the 240 in the 70s and the 740 in the 80s, and by the 940 they worked out almost any possible issue. I only wish one could have gotten them with AWD and a fuel efficient diesel (they had the latter but it was not sold here in the USA).The author seems to have a lot of electrical hacking knowledge, but didn't know some car stuff that could have made getting these controls installed much easier:1) They could have just swapped in a newer BOSCH ABS pump, which can activate the brakes electrically without involving the brake booster. European cars started getting these when they got traction control in the late 90s, but I believe some would be virtually (or maybe even exactly) a direct swap into this vehicle. I was able to do this in a VW with about 10 minutes of work, which uses the same basic ABS systems as Volvo. This is assuming the car already had factory ABS which I think most (but possibly not all) 940s did.2) They could fix the steering problem by swapping in an entire electric steering rack- they're fairly standard dimension wise, installing a fully manual rack from a Volvo 240, or adding an A/C compressor clutch to the hydraulic power steering pump to disable it above parking speeds (the only time torque would be high anyways). Moreover, these racks are strong enough to simply work with the hydraulic assist removed, because people in the Volvo racing/performance community do it all the time.3) This car does not have a carburetor- it is electrically fuel injected. You can see the fuel injectors and rail above the throttle body. This could be just a mistranslation if the author is not a native english speaker. However, more importantly there was a factory system on this car to electrically control the throttle for the cruise control. They are missing those parts, but they are cheap and common, and would have just dropped in to a bracket and cam already on his engine. They consist of a vacuum servo on the throttle itself connected to a box that can actuate this with an electrical signal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;This is the only major actuator that I couldn’t easily find a suitable modern automotive solution for. This is mainly because newer cars don’t have carburators anymore, but rather use direct injection and advanced engine control units.Actually injection system is largely independent from throttle control. Required amount of fuel is calculated based on manifold air pressure sensor, so there were cars with fuel injection and cable operated throttle plate. I suppose the problem was with plumbing in modern throttle body as carburetor needs to be upstream of throttle plate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing story!  I have been involved in openpilot development for the past 5 years, and I am always interested in the user stories of this project.I drove my car 2500 miles on Openpilot this holiday and it was wonderful. I took over maybe 10% of the trip and let automation handle the rest.  That said, there are many many many areas of improvement and I have devoted this year to creating an openpilot fork to bring it's ADAS functionality closer to modern vehicles (read: tesla).I will Show HN the first release!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592910</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved the article that this links to about 'Jump Flood Algorithm'!:https://bgolus.medium.com/the-quest-for-very-wide-outlines-b...So fascinating! Thanks for indirectly leading me to this! I love thinking about all the various approaches available at the pixel/texel/etc level!It's also another case where it's a very clever way of generating a type of SDF (Signed Distance Field) that is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting. Such a killer result here as well! Any-width-outline-you-like in linear time?!! Amazing when compared to the cost of the brute-force ones at huge widths!I wholeheartedly endorse SDFs, whether they are 'vector' ones, function-based, like Inigo Quilez's amazing work, Or 'raster' ones like in the article, texel-or-voxel-based. Houdini supports raster-SDFs very well I think, has a solid, mature set of SDF-tools worth checking out (there's a free version if you don't have a lic)!And of course there's all the many other places SDFs are used!! So useful! Definitely worth raising-awareness of I reckon!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One day, I'd love to dive into stylised 3D graphics as an R&amp;D project. There's been decent progress recently, but I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit left to pick.Some open questions:- How do you reduce the detail of a toon-rendered 3D model as the camera zooms out? How do you seamlessly transition between its more-stylised and less-stylised appearance?- Hand-drawn 2D animations often have watercolour backgrounds. Can we convincingly render 3D scenery as a watercolour painting? How can we smoothly animate things like brush-strokes and paper texture in screen space?- How should a stylised 3D game portray smoke, flames, trees, grass, mud, rainfall, fur, water...?- Hand-drawn 2D animations (and some recent 3D animations) can be physically incorrect: the artist may subtly reshape the "model" to make it look better from the current camera angle. In a game with a freely-moving camera, could we automate that?- When dealing with a stylised 3D renderer, what would the ideal "mesh editor" and "scenery editor" programs look like? Do those assets need to have a physically-correct 3D surface and 3D armature, or could they be defined in a more vague, abstract way?- Would it be possible to render retro pixel art from a simple 3D model? If so, could we use this to make a procedurally-generated 2D game?- Could we use stylisation to make a 3D game world feel more physically correct? For example, when two meshes accidentally intersect, could we make that intersection less obvious to the viewer?There are probably enough questions there to fill ten careers, but I suppose that's a good thing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great breakdown of outline rendering techniques! The detailed explanations and code snippets are super helpful for understanding Unity's shader possibilities. Thanks for sharing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42593614</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article! Here's one more, including animations on B-trees: https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Slotted pages are composed of three components: a header (containing metadata about the page), cells (variable-sized “slots” for data to be stored in), and offset pointers (an array of pointers to those cells). The benefit of this layout is that you can store variable sized data, since the cells can be of variable size, and you don’t need to move that data to logically reorder it. Reordering the positions of the pointers in the pointer array is sufficient. This is inexpensive since the pointers are small, and in a well-known position at the beginning of the page. In other words, as long as the offset pointers are ordered in key-sorted order, it doesn’t matter where in the actual page the keys are stored.Does that really make a difference if we have to re-write the entire tree node anyway, even if it's just for reordering the pointers (because node == page)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a SQLite disk-page explorer a little while ago, helped me understand B-trees a lot better:https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583947</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks great, beautiful landing page and it looks like a labor of love!- Most of the page titles are the (same)[1] which doesn't seem good for SEO. Each of the pages like "Pricing" or "Compress Your Video Files" should be differently named.- The "video compressor" tool would be much more useful if you could enter a target file size. This is a frequent use case, if you want to send a video over email or social media apps like Messenger with a file size limit. The only way I've been able to do that for myself is basically encode it repeatedly with ffmpeg at various quality settings until the file size is just small enough, but you could probably automate that with something more intelligent like a good guess and a binary search. I'm sure someone's made a library to do that already though.- It needs a whole bunch of features related to subtitles, like making a subtitled GIF from a video file with subtitles.- Maybe risky to include copyrighted work like the Spider-Verse movie in the demo video? Unless you really did rip it legally from a Blu-ray.- There are random grammar mistakes and capitalization issues throughout the site, nothing major but worth a pass by a native English speaker. "What kinda files Pimosa supports?" and "Every files gets processed on your device only" as some examples. Might give some people pause.- Could be worth to have a more prominent "Download" box at the top section that automatically detects your OS. Most landing pages have that so I assume it works.[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fpimosa....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While you are not too far into selling - a word of advice.Switch to offering a year of free updates and charge a small fee after that.Trust me. You will coverge to this scheme sooner or later, so do it now.  -

Standalone Windows installer is a must.Windows Store is still a deserted wasteland and is not a default choice for the vast majority of Windows users. You are losing a ton of users over this.  -

ffmpeg and other dependencies need to be acknowledged for both ethical and technical reasons. The technical reason is that your app doesn't depend on OS-supplied codecs and doesn't require installing them separately. And ethical reasons I hope are obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS can make billions from open source. On the other hand, solo developers who try the same path are basically seen as scammers.Ironic.And creating a good user interface is very, very hard. Otherwise Gimp wouldn't be the monstrosity it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585009</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The secret is that restaurants which make traditional cacio e pepe are using pasta water to emulsify the sauce.But it's not the same pasta water you're using at home!Only a tiny amount of starch is coming off of the 500g of pasta you just cooked in the proper ratio in 5000g of water (with 50g of salt).  They've been cooking with their pasta water all day or all week;  It's completely full of starch that came off the other pasta.Dump a bunch of cornstarch or flour in there to get above 1% concentration (or more efficiently, into a tiny portion in a bowl) to replicate the emulsifying effect, or just use a different emulsifier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trick is to:   1. Cook the pasta in very little water ("pasta risottata").

   2. Vigorously agitate (emulsify) the sauce with that super starchy broth

If you do it right, no water is drained at all:

If you can't show a diagram to explain why you chose that ratio of ingredients, why should I trust you to have made the optimal sauce?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585707</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an innovative approach in Colorado where solar energy is being integrated with farming practices, creating a synergistic relationship that promotes sustainability. This model illustrates how agricultural land can be utilized for solar energy production without compromising crop growth, allowing for dual use of the land. The synergy between solar farms and agriculture not only helps in reducing carbon footprints but also supports local economies and food production, offering a pathway toward a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested in the economics of this project, the details are available in this publication:https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88816.pdfSummary: This particular research project won’t quite break even purely on market-rate electricity sales, due to having 2x the installation cost of utility scale solar.  If high value crops are successfully grown, there are scenarios where it could break even after including profits from crop sales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If he did any energy consuming processes to aide farming such as drying wheat to harden it and increase market price, or had greenhouses which needed heating, or a dairy adjunct which needed cooling, then his rate of return as cost avoidance and improved profit for the Ag. side could be a lot bigger than the 1c/kW to sell power back.Basically, heat energy is time shifting be it coolth or warmth. And heat and cool cost money.Farmers in Oz are using droids to spray and weed, so battery charging could be another cost avoidance.Or cold store for produce to sell at advantageous prices in winter. Basic arbitrage gains to permit the farm yield to maximise against predictable price variance.Colorado has rich people. Grow microherbs out of season.Farms often have a lot of less viable land for primary production. They could deploy flow batteries which have size costs, but massive mwh return and scale very nicely and last a very long time. Even just water pumping shifts energy into storage. Farms are giant machines for converting sunlight and water into produce anyway, this is a good fit: it's the same energy source, shifted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a cool concept and I love the idea but the math on the money earned from the 3276 solar panel doesn't add up. The article says the farm owner makes about $20,000 a year from the solar farm.I'm assuming that each solar panel is 2 by 1 meter, which would mean that it produces about 400 watts (20% efficiency at 1000 watts per sq meter coming from the sun). You can use this calculator to estimate how power you can produce at the given location for a given system size in kilowatts:
https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.phpThe system above is 1310400 watts or ~1,310 kW, which according to the calculator produces about 2 million kWh/year.If he makes $20,000 that would mean that he gets paid only $0.01 per kW of power. And even if my assumption above about the size of each individual panel is off by a factor of 2 and they are only 1 sq meter in size (which I think they are not because the article states that the solar farm can power about 300 average households, which require the annual power output to be more than what I estimated above) that would make $0.02 per kW of power. How is it possible that the amount earned per kW is so low when the utility companies in Colorado charge about $0.14 per kW (effective rate)? And who is actually the customer here and where is the money coming from? I'm just curious to learn more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590903</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "fdroid-fakesigner-poc" provides a proof of concept for bypassing the signature verification process in F-Droid, an open-source Android app repository. The project aims to demonstrate vulnerabilities that could allow malicious apps to be installed despite not having valid signatures, emphasizing the need for improved security measures within app distribution platforms. The repository includes code and documentation detailing how the proof of concept works, as well as instructions for reproduction and potential implications for the safety of users downloading applications from F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish we would take defining what it means for an artifact to be signed more seriously.Which key(s) is it signed with? What is the hash of the corresponding unsigned artifact?Signature verification tools should have some option which prints these things in a machine-readable format.I did some work on reproducibility of Android apps and system images with Nix, and while defining a build step which can automatically establish these relationships sounds a bit goofy, it can make the issues with underspecified edge cases visible by defining verification more strictly. I did not do this to look for those edge cases though.I am still working on that type of stuff now, but on more fundamental issues of trust we could start addressing with systems like Nix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While none of that applies to F-Droids primary use case (the primary F-Droid repo builds all apps from source itself), it nonetheless looks like they failed to correctly handle the issue.The only reason this didn't turn into a disaster was pure luck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential, but:I often wonder how secure these open source projects actually are.  I'm curious about using Waydroid in SteamOS, but it looks like it only runs LineageOS (apparently a derivative of CyanogenMod).I know that people claim that open source is more secure because anyone can audit it, but I wonder how closely its security actually interrogated.  Seems like it could be a massive instance of the bystander effect.All of it gives me a bias towards using official sources from companies like Apple and Google, who presumably hire the talent and institute the processes to do things right.  And in any case, having years/decades of popularity is its own form of security.  You know anyone who cares has already taken shots at Android and iOS, and they're still standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590307</guid></item><item><title>8.

Just photograph/scan the photographic paper and invert the colors.I'm not affiliated with them, but Solarcan sells ready made single-use pinhole cameras. An almost zero-regret purchase I'd say.[1] You see the sun move through one year of skies, as seen from my balcony: https://files.rombouts.email/IMG_6500.jpegPeople have made wonderful, mildly spooky pictures with these: https://solarcan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/solarcan-p...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/usfd5To avoid HN hug of death on this 1832 users Mastodon instance.Very cool arrangement of those pictures, i was wondering what he has done about the daytime pictures when i read the title.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incredibly cool. I love this so much, both artistically as well as how it demonstrate the equation of time [1] -- the fact that the changes in sunrise and sunset are not symmetrical.On the other hand, it's driving me absolutely crazy that he centers the image at 4:00 rather than midnight. Or maybe that's to show the shimmer of sunlight a little after noon on the right hand side?I can't figure out why it's "bluest" closest to dawn and dusk. I'm guessing the exposure makes a huge difference, and obviously the night part is way more exposed than the daylight part, or else it would be much darker. Wondering if the camera used automatic exposure, and how much of the brightness of colors in the image are artifacts because of that? Also if he locked the white point hopefully?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42595190</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of breaking complex tasks into smaller, more manageable segments, specifically in the context of programming and code optimization. It emphasizes the value of grouping loops and using the "yield" keyword to improve performance and clarity in code execution. By breaking long-running tasks into smaller chunks, developers can enhance both the efficiency and readability of their code, ultimately leading to better performance in applications. The piece combines personal insights with technical advice, making it relevant for programmers looking to refine their coding practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's insane that "don't block the UI thread" is so complicated. I never would have expected half the article to be about an edge case if the user is in a background tab.What's worse is I don't even know how you're supposed to know what the edge cases are without stumbling into them.  You shouldn't have to know about APIs like document.hidden unless you specifically want to handle background tabs differently. They shouldn't leak into the regular event loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's old is new again. Some of the same techniques used to keep pre-MacOS-X applications responsive, back when MacOS was cooperatively scheduled, show up here.This begs the question of what is a reasonable programming model? In the MacOS case, the forcing function was buying NeXT, using their Unix kernel for MacOS, and literally firing the OS engineers who disagreed with preemptive multitasking.For these browsers, is there a programming model that could be instituted where processing in these handlers didn't hold up the main UI thread?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the problem is that async-ification infects everything up the call chain. converting a synchronous loop to async may now require that you change a lot of your sync code above that loop into async code as well, which can complicate all sorts of stuff like debugging, profiling, error handling.for this reason i always optimize the shit out of all synchronous code before resorting to async. and if you do need to go async after that, you might be better off just offloading that optimized synchronous op to a worker thread (or to wasm) to not block the UI.modern JS vms are insanely fast when you pay attention to GC pressure, mem allocation, monomorphism, and dont use accidentally quadratic algos. it's rare that i encounter a codebase that can't be sped up by some large multiple without ever resorting to an async/defer crutch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592224</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent increase in the number of students in Japan who are engaging in "shadow learning," which refers to supplemental education outside of regular school hours, such as private tutoring and cram schools. This trend has been driven by heightened academic pressures and the desire for better entrance exam results, highlighting concerns about educational inequity and the burden it places on students and families.

The theory is that drinking water can wash away the virus from your saliva, inhibiting its ability to spread through bites.It makes sense that a virus passed through saliva would evolve like this, but I just find it particularly unsettling when a pathogen can effect higher-level behaviors like drinking water (or jumping into water for mantises).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sea turtle hatchlings have an inborn tendency to move in the brightest direction. On a natural beach, the brightest direction is most often the open view of the night sky over, and reflected by, the ocean. [0]Man made artificial lighting greatly affect sea turtle hatchlings also. There are several groups of volunteers who watch the eggs for hatching and will help the sea turtles  make their way towards the sea.The volunteers use apps to coordinate watching the eggs and there is tons of data collected. Using AI / ML to help determine when the eggs will hatch or creating autonomous drones to watch the eggs and perhaps assist in corralling the hatchlings to the sea would make great PhD dissertation subjects.[0] https://myfwc.com/research/wildlife/sea-turtles/threats/arti...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in this subject, Carl Zimmer wrote a great book that has all sorts of examples of parasites that control their host: "Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures"https://www.amazon.com/Parasite-Rex-Bizarre-Dangerous-Creatu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590055</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the concept of “Naur's principle,” which emphasizes the importance of understanding and clearly communicating the design process in programming language development. It critiques traditional programming models and advocates for a more comprehensive approach that considers the user’s perspective and the interaction between various components. The author argues for the integration of formal specifications and informal communication to enhance clarity and effectiveness in software engineering, ultimately aiming to improve the quality and usability of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the most important papers in software engineering, which I believe everyone in this profession should read and internalize.Every time I see another startup trying use LLMs for code generation I sigh in despair. As AI technology improves and becomes better at producing code, what looks like a win in the short term will end up creating more and more code that has been created without a human going through the necessary thought processes and problem solving steps to build the theory of the software as described in this paper.It's also why its critically important for companies to do what they can to retain the people who built the software in the first place, or at least ensure there's enough continuity as new people join the team so they can build their mental model by working alongside the original developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As relevant as ever, arguably more relevant than ever as more programs are being written and need to be adapted, in more and more complex domains.Note what Naur means with Theory here. Quoting from the paper:"What will be considered here is the suggestion that the programmers' knowledge properly should be regarded as a theory, in the sense of Ryle [Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind, 1946]. Very briefly, a person who has or possesses a theory in this sense knows how to do certain things and in addition can support the actual doing with explanations, justifications, and answers to queries, about the activity of concern."This is not "theory" in the sense we sometimes encounter in colloquial speech in the sense of (exclusively) "assumption", especially not with the connotation "unjustified assumption". It is also not a set of rules:"The dependence of a theory on a grasp of certain kinds of similarity between situations and events of the real world gives the reason why the knowledge held by someone who has the theory could not, in principle, be expressed in terms of rules. In fact, the similarities in question are not, and cannot be, expressed in terms of criteria, no more than the similarities of many other kinds of objects, such as human faces, tunes, or tastes of wine, can thus be expressed."Yet, it plays a central role in programming:"For a program to retain its quality it is mandatory that each modification is firmly grounded in the theory of it. Indeed, the very notion of qualities such as simplicity and good structure can only be understood in terms of the theory of the program, since they characterize the actual program text in relation to such program texts that might have been written to achieve the same execution behaviour, but which exist only as possibilities in the programmer's understanding."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t declarative programming and by extension functional programming adhere more to the ethos of ‘Programming as Theory Building’ ?I recently started building mobile apps using Flutter after a decade of developing apps using imperative programming languages and I’m really in love with the declarative nature of flutter.Similarly for web development, I always loved HTML and so HTMX has been a boon for me. I’m using Go for backend, but I’ve been thinking whether I should move on to a proper functional programming language like Elixir with Phoenix since I’m liking declarative programming very much?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592543</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the graphics capabilities of Windows 3.x, particularly focusing on the limitations and features of the graphics programming interfaces available during that era. It explains the transition from 16-bit to more advanced graphics techniques and explores the graphics APIs like GDI (Graphics Device Interface), detailing how they enabled developers to create visually engaging applications despite the constraints of the platform. The piece also touches on the historical context of Windows 3.x in the evolution of PC graphics and the impact it had on software development at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SVGA support aside, it will never cease to astound me that you can load Windows 3.x on a modern standards-supporting PC and get basic VGA working out-of-the-box but you cannot do the same on modern Linux/BSD to get a basic software-accelerated VGA framebuffer supported by Xorg/Wayland if you don't have the right drivers installed (and the correct configuration files manually set up).(the dead xfree86 project was probably the closest attempt to making this "just work" though it had a long way to go; this approach was not preserved in the Xorg fork)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author mentions the screen being corrupted when a DOS prompt is opened in windowed mode. This can happen because the DOS prompt runs in a separate VM (in V86 mode), and makes calls into the VGA ROM BIOS via INT 10h. The VGA ROM BIOS on this machine is probably a wrapper over VBE; that is, it probably contains IN and OUT instructions that talk to the VBE I/O ports, 0x1CE and 0x1CF. These reads and writes from the DOS VM will, by default, be allowed to reach the physical hardware if they are not virtualized by the VMM.This is a common problem that authors of Windows 3.x/9x display drivers had to handle, although the specific I/O port numbers to be virtualized vary by graphics adapter. There are samples in the Win95 DDK that show how to use the VMM services Install_IO_Handler and Enable/Disable_Global_Trapping to set up I/O port traps, and VDD_Get_VM_Info from within the trap handler to determine the VM that currently owns the CRTC. This allows the trap handler to reach a decision about whether to allow an I/O to reach the hardware, or to virtualize the access in some way. A good virtualization policy to start with is probably just to drop any writes from non-CRTC-owner VMs. Any additional needed complexity can be added from there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That old Windows 3.1 GUI looks so much more intuitive, efficient, and usable compared to what we've got today.https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/640...What would Win11 even look like on a lower-resolution display such as in TFA?The Win11 Start Menu is borderline unusable beyond typing in a keyword and praying to the circuits.

Great concept and nice site.However.  Its hilariously unrealistic.  Just memorize these 500 simple glyph's and become a master of conceptual game design and you can play anything with this deck!The hard part is not the deck.  Its finding another person that will actually learn all this so you can use it,lol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583986</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous I/O completion notification was a huge innovation, allowing computation to proceed concurrently with I/O and thus dramatically increasing the throughput of the computer.  Unfortunately it was also a huge source of bugs.  The following innovation that made it usable, by making it less bug-prone, was called a "multitasking operating system".  The so-called "OS" allowed you to write simple sequential code, but used the computer efficiently by switching back and forth between multiple tasks as their respective I/Os completed.  We're talking about the introduction of the Univac 1103A in 01953, 72 years ago, and the following 20 years of innovations, including things like Dijkstra's THE operating system.That is, asynchronous I/O is 20 years older than the Unix system call interface this article speculates it should replace.Of course, context switching between different tasks is not free, and event loops have frequently been able to provide higher efficiency.  The equilibrium has rocked back and forth as I/O has gotten faster and slower relative to task context switching.  CICS, select(), poll(), Oberon, the Macintosh system, Win16, the JavaScript event loop, Tcl/Tk, Win32 IOCP, Symbian active objects, kqueue, epoll, and io_uring are some of the results.But don't try to sell asynchronous I/O as a "game-changing" paradigm shift.  It's a different programming model that's harder to program but can provide higher performance, just like it has been for 70 years.If you're shopping for a paradigm shift that can improve this tradeoff, there are several candidates.  Erlang-style lightweight processes, software transactional memory, and JS-style promises (originally from E, which was inspired by KeyKOS, which had event loops but no promises or asynchronous I/O) come to mind.The hardware development that might be actually new has arguably already failed in the market: Intel/Micron's "Optane" memory and Flash-based NVDIMMs.  Flash has big disk energy, but is fast enough that copying it to RAM one word at a time like disk will probably bottleneck your performance by an order of magnitude.  io_uring doesn't fix this.  We need interfaces designed for zero-copy access to bulk persistent data.  Maybe something like Multics or mmap().  LMDB and FlatBuffers suggest that the potential for improved performance is significant. Could such high-bandwidth, low-cost memory keep up with LLM inference, allowing you to do inference on a 256-gigabyte model with 256 gigabytes of Flash but a much smaller amount of RAM?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;"Our operating systems want to do things asynchronously, on their own terms. They'll tell you when they're done. Maybe this is a new era. Maybe making syscalls from 1970s Unix directly is like a remote procedure call to another machine - a leaky abstraction, a feeble attempt to impose your old mental model onto a new reality."I think the article fell off here. Linux has a profoundly synchronous I/O system. The I/O U-Ring works there by dispatching requests to a kernel-maintained pool of worker threads. There the submitted request are run synchronously.So the I/O U-Ring is in fact the abstraction, "a feeble attempt to impose your [new] mental model onto an [old] reality", as the author might put it. The actual Linux I/O system is most trivially exposed to userland by the same old "1970s Unix" means of the traditional system calls.The real change with the I/O U-Ring is that it offers a way to submit work in bulk and finally introduces to Linux a form of I/O that appears to the program to be truly asynchronous.(And it's not without some fair cause that file I/O is implemented as synchronous code. It's hard to do it asynchronously when it's a complex operation with many steps, where you are interacting with a page cache, not only for file contents but even caching the very metadata that describes how to get from an offset into a file to the block numbers where the data is stored. Windows has a famously profoundly asynchronous I/O system and even there actual file I/O is done just the same with synchronous logic ran in a worker thread, or copied directly from the cache if the requested data is already there.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This change of mentality is similar to how monolithic kernels get praised, only to have daemons, microservices and containers all over the place, using a much slower OS IPC communication channel than if it had been a microkernel from the start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592126</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the concept of polymathy, highlighting the value of being knowledgeable in multiple disciplines and how this interdisciplinary approach can foster creativity and innovation. It examines historical figures who exemplified polymathy, analyzes the cognitive and societal benefits of diverse learning, and addresses the challenges faced by modern individuals in pursuing a breadth of knowledge. The paper argues for the importance of cultivating polymathic skills in today's rapidly evolving world to promote adaptability and problem-solving capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

The rest will struggle to remain relevant.It is safe to say that this prediction did not come to pass. The system (pun) keeps churning idiot-savants, well-trained cogs in the giant machine that society had been reduced to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great piece. One of the best places cultivating this type of polymathy today is Stanford's Symbolic Systems Program. https://symsys.stanford.edu/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If one is looking for a single label to encompass many of the new foundations – perhaps to form a new school or department – I would suggest Systems.What about good old philosophy?Philosophy already has a long tradition of birthing new sciences, a long tradition of encouraging polymath thinking and a long tradition of estabilishing foundational ways of thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42596450</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article investigates the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, focusing on the presence of a mole within the organization who infiltrated its ranks to gather intelligence on their activities, particularly during the January 6 Capitol riots. It details the motivations and experiences of the informant, shedding light on the internal dynamics, extremist ideologies, and the legal repercussions faced by members involved in the insurrection. The piece highlights the broader implications of militia movements in the U.S. and raises questions about domestic extremism and security.&lt;/p&gt;

What more did Williams need to do the first time he reached out to garner interest? Does ProPublica overestimate the seriousness of the militia movement? I’d think based on J6 the journalists ignoring Williams’ communications should have paid attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infinite Luigis Theory:I get a sense that we are beginning to see a resurgence in lone-wolf style operator activism and crime (or terrorism, etc., depending on your view of things), sort of like was more common 30+ years ago, a la the Unibomber, Skyjacker, all of the serial killers in the 60-80s.The reasons of “why now” and “why lone wolf” are complicated but mostly boil down to high availability of information (awareness of opsec) and relatively low trust amongst social groups and of institutions, coupled with a more online and more destabilized male demographic the younger you go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sowing that distrust is why Williams is going on the record, albeit without his original nameI don’t understand this. There’s an insane level of detail here that if true immediately reveals his identity to those involved. How does withholding his name change anything?&gt; On March 20… He’d helped persuade Seddon and his lieutenants to fire the head of AP3’s Utah chapter and to install Williams in his place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594766</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;SWC4J is a Java library designed for working with the SWC (Standard Widget Component) format, commonly used in Flash and ActionScript projects. The library facilitates the manipulation and parsing of SWC files, allowing developers to extract and work with their contents programmatically. SWC4J aims to provide a simple and efficient way to integrate SWC functionality into Java applications, making it easier to manage Flash components and assets. The repository includes documentation, examples, and a structured framework for users to leverage SWC files within their Java-based environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title doesn’t do it justice - everything with images quickly adds up.Doing 120 fps video at 4K so that any chosen frame looks amazing without artifacts is really quite an achievement.The microphones were actually more interesting to me, that you can get lavalier performance from the tiny mics in the phone that are physically far from the person being recorded is seriously clever.Getting this to work some of the time is already an achievement but I think people underestimate how much work goes into making it work across all different scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; 38% of people said that better cameras are a main motivation for buying a new phoneThis strikes me as just a reflection of the ad campaigns. Apple promotes “better cameras” for every new iPhone, almost exclusively in their ads, so it’s not surprising that’s what people would say. With every new phone being just an incremental upgrade, hyping up the camera is the only way to get people to drop a $1000 on a new one. Most of these 38% won’t be able to tell the difference between a phone pic taken 5 or more years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really a puff piece - for instance, Nokia had a 1 billion pixels per second processing pipeline on their 808 PureView phone.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when PistonMiner finished the fix and executed it on the "flight model". They were quite literally jumping up and down in happiness and the whole Chair of Space Technology at TU Berlin was gossipping about it in the hallways :) Amazing hack, absolute hats off to them. By the way, this is their bachelor's thesis.We have used the vtable trick many times in satellite software operations, whenever we had to "quickly patch" this or that function, without having to uplink a whole software update - which as they explain in the talk, is quite an involved process that takes significant time and resources to complete.Happy to answer or forward any questions about nanosatellites, software in space, etc!P.S.: it looks there is a bit of a mix-up with the audio of the recorded talks. The default audio track contains a Polish dubbing. Select the "eng-deu-pol 1080p (mp4)" which seems to be the correct one. (And thanks to the A/V team at CCC for your efforts to make this content accessible to everyone &lt;3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A neat detail from the talk: It's on the Amateur Radio 70cm band, and has a digipeater running. PistonMiner is willing to turn it on for people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to say this is perhaps one of my favourite CCC talks.Interesting subject matter, novel technical problems and solutions, story narrated at speed and with just enough information to fill in typical knowledge gaps, and on top of all of that there's slides and answers ready to go for random questions from the audience.Wonderful job, PistonMiner!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575390</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My active hours are typically very early AM, 2-4AM, until 10AM, and there is definitely a space for this in the market for individuals that just want a place to relax and/or work outside of their home outside of normal working hours. Starbucks used to fill this niche where I lived (they would open at 3,4AM to accommodate students in the area trying to study for finals. Nowadays, most of these starbucks/coffee shops have closed or shifted to an in-store hostile setup of a drive through plus a lobby that is mostly intended for delivery drivers, walled off laptop plugs and won't tell you why, removed all charging stations, and just generally made it a shitty experience to sit inside and do anything at all other than get the hell out. This is almost universal now where i live, a college town with multiple colleges, and I wouldn't even begin to tell you where to find a coffee shop where I could gather with 3-4 other grad students and bang some crazy project out in a few hours anymore, and I have many, many big colleges near me. There's a demand the market isn't meeting, but, that demand didn't rake in the most dollars so here we are and this is some kind of novelty. These kinds of spaces existed basically everywhere in my area circa 2012-2018. They weren't tied to any particular ethnicity, just was a need people apparently had.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My general takeaway from a bunch of comments is that there were two death waves for these late night places. But, I have a great fix.First, Starbucks committed coffeeshopicide by targeting local hangouts that were  successful, and then spraying their own burnt grounds, driving up real estate and making it impossible for a small, less efficient shop to survive. I saw this happen at several great places in Portland. Then, obviously a career climbing executive at Starbucks tried to get promoted and tightened up hours.The second wave of late night coffee shop deaths occured with COVID and homelessness (really McKinsey and Purdue opioids, read "When McKinsey Comes to Town") because of safety. No one, big or small, can offer a space and decide which hipster can stay and which has to leave because he is now addicted to drugs and not just Instagram dopamine.The solution: cities should offer a tax break to a coffee shop that stays open late. And, cities should offer a match where they create a space nearby for homeless people to congregate late night. I'm sure there is a correlation between the number of homeless and soon-to-be homeless creative types.I'm saddened late night coffee shops have largely disappeared, these Yemeni shops look terrific. And, they bring the social back to meeting places, and I don't mean social media and laptops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are coffee shops just the answer to having social spaces that aren't alcohol fueled like bars and clubs? For quite a while I have had a rough idea that there could be something along the lines of a bar but with no alcohol and some kind of structured activities for breaking the ice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584610</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The project "elks" on GitHub is focused on developing a lightweight Linux kernel designed specifically for embedded systems and retro computing. It aims to create a small, efficient environment capable of running on limited hardware resources, making it suitable for older platforms and minimalistic applications. The repository includes documentation, source code, and resources for building and using the kernel, encouraging contributions and collaboration from developers interested in embedded systems and low-resource computing scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the comments! ELKS will run on an 8088, but also runs on any x86 PC using the legacy "real mode" which runs in 16-bit segmented architecture without an MMU or any hardware protection. It can be fun to boot a PC and see a close resemblance to Linux, but run the way things used to be, using only 16-bits.It'll also run in ROM, e.g. using a 8018x CPU w/onboard PIT and PIC.The point of ELKS today is about "small is beautiful" and seeing what can be done when limited to 64k code and 64k data, and 640k RAM. It's based on a very old fork of Linux and many of the internal structures are similar to what was found in Linux 2.0, without the changes for SMP support.We just recently got a native C compiler/assembler/linker toolchain up and running. I must say making that happen provided some vivid comparisons of what programmers had to go through in decades past in both slower speeds and small executable file sizes, versus what we all have and expect today at our fingertips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently added dual screen support to the ELKS console-direct driver, so if your system has both MDA and CGA cards, you enable CONFIG_CONSOLE_DUAL in your kernel config and select runlevel 5 in /bootopts, it will allocate 4 ttys, with one of them on the MDA display. You can see this setup running on my hardware in this pic in the README:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghaerr/elks/refs/heads/mas...I could use some help testing it on EGA and VGA hardware, as I don’t have any 8 bit cards for those in my collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The memories. I had it run ("installed" would be a big word ona 2 flopppy and no hard drive system) on a super cute Carry-1 8088 computer ages ago, which I stupidly sold on Ebay shortly after as I had no use for it.
Here's one of the very rare photos online.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The picture in this blog is the later version of the ICON, but it ran the same QNX OS, programs, and games, and used the same LEXICON file server for it all.In case anyone is interested in more information about the earlier version of the ICON (and the LEXICON file server it ran from), here are my two blogs posts:https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/icon-computer/https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/lexicon-computer/One interesting QNX command we used to get in trouble in high school was apb (all points bulletin) - here's a demo of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr8ts6zV2DU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Each Unisys ICON came with its own monitor and a very robust keyboard with a trackball embedded in it.The trackballs were robust indeed.Due to the client/server nature; a classroom of kids logging in at the same time could take several minutes and most of that time would be filled with a classroom of 7 year olds spinning the heck out of the tennis ball sized trackball.One more knowledgeable teacher once told us that the this probably made the computers slower because each time you do something it has to pause and decide what to do. I guess he understood interrupts somehow.But that logic doesn’t work on 8 year olds with a trackball and nothing else to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Ottawa, where QNX originates. My high school must have had someone with family connections to the company, because we could have built a significant Beowulf cluster with all the Icons.These systems had numerous problems, one of which was the school board's severe lack of resources to manage them. The teachers were limited in what they were allowed or able to do, so if a lab went down, it typically took about a week to get someone to fix it. As students, we used this to our advantage. I have fond memories of causing all sorts of issues on these systems as a kid. Another perk was that my school wasn’t air-conditioned, except for the computer labs, so during the hot months it's where you wanted to be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594387</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great project! I’m amazed by the ingenuity of running a CNN on a TI-84 Plus CE.Given the ez80 CPU's limitations with floating-point operations, do you think fixed-point arithmetic could significantly speed up inference without adding too much complexity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mostly unrelated, but I remember typing in a simple calculator program (hex codes I think) from a magazine for my Apple IIe that would then speak the answer aloud. I was fascinated by the fact you could type in things that then created the sound of a voice. Googling isn't yielding much but I'll dig around and see if I can find it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I first started coding in high school on the TI-84 calculators. My 1st language was TI-BASIC, 2nd was Z80 assembly - quite a big step - and I quit when I faced some tricky bugs that my teenage self could not figure out :-) Back then, I don't believe they had a C/C++ toolchain. Some time later, I tried using Small Device C compiler (SDCC), but encountered several compiler bugs which I couldn't fix but duly reported. Great to see there is such excellent tooling nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584860</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also generally known as LFSRs (Linear Feedback Shift Registers): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register. One advantange is that they can be easily implemented in hardware (and then very cheaply implemented in emulators). For instance the noise generators in audio chips of 80s home computers were typically an LFSR with around 16 bits of state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any particular reason why this straightforward implementation of a well-known PRNG (published by Marsaglia 20 years ago) is worth being linked from HN's first page?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was just reading about this because I am writing a chess engine.  I am using somebody else's move generator, I am not sure how it works but it is not front of mind because it is spending most time evaluating and managing transposition tables according to the profiler, I can at least 5x those and maybe I will worry about another microoptimisation then.  But really move ordering can make a 10x change and I am going to iterative deepening, pv, killer heuristic and such.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592316</guid></item><item><title>28.

[1]In my experience, the off the shelf LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) do a pretty poor job with assembly, they can not reason about the stack or stack frames well.I think your job will be the same with or without AI. Figuring out the data structures and data types a function is operating on and naming variables.What are you reverse engineering for? For example, getting a full compilable decompilation has different goals than finding vulnerabilities or patching a bug.1. https://sidekick.binary.ninja/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The LLM4Decompile project (https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile) provides some open models for binary to C decompilation and Ghidra pseudocode refinement, along with some training sets.RevEng.ai, linked a few times already, discusses their approach here: https://blog.reveng.ai/training-an-llm-to-decompile-assembly...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42573232</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolving nature of crime reporting in newspapers, highlighting how traditional crime stories are adapting to changing social contexts and journalistic standards. It emphasizes the importance of nuanced reporting that goes beyond sensationalism to include the voices of victims and communities affected by crime. The piece also addresses the impact of digital media on crime journalism, noting the necessity for newspapers to engage with their audiences through more in-depth, responsible, and contextually rich storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IRL I knew someone who was charged with child sexual abuse.  He went to prison awaiting trial, but the prosecution dropped the charges before it got there.  He was released and went about his life.Meanwhile his mug shot photo in the local paper was the number one google search result for his name.  And then it reached syndication for other news sites as well.Ideally those news paper articles should be updated to say the prosecution dropped the charges, but the reality is that at where I live, the arrest makes news but the prosecution dropping charges does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I understand this is the general policy in a few places, like Germany. The general idea seems to be that it is more beneficial to a society if criminals are given a viable avenue to lead non-criminal lives again, with the alternative being people going "ah fuck it, I guess I'm a criminal now".I'm surprised at this concept spreading in the US, since the system would generally benefit from having perpetual perpetrators percolating through the prison slavery system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of a laugh-out-loud closing paragraph in a 2009 NYT article about the clash between Wikipedia &amp; German lawyers over some infamous murderers' right-to-be-forgotten.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/us/13wiki.htmlRead the whole thing for maximum effect, but for me it beautifully demonstrates the contrast between the USA/Wikipedia/NYT ethos of "the truth is always printable and your speech is by default 'on the record'" and alternate expectations elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42595307</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pay for Rewind, and honestly, it’s one of the best investments I've made in software. After each Zoom meeting, I receive a summary of everything discussed, including action items to add to my to-do list. Every Monday, I also ask it to remind me of what I accomplished the previous week to help me prepare for my 1:1 meeting. Everything is recorded locally, allowing me to search for anything I did earlier in the day quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;capturing and uploading a whole new PNG for each screencap is not what I would call 'efficient', and to meet the use case of Rewind.ai in the first place it should have some OCR mechanism to pull up the relevant screencaps.The thing that enabled rewind.ai and MS Recall is storing the series of screenshots more like a HEIF, allowing for massive compression ratio and on-device storage + OCR provided by the OS (Live Text since Monterey 2021 [0], Microsoft introduced it last year for Snapdragon based AI-PCs [1])I guess this is a good starting point if the goal is to fill S3 buckets with screencaps of multiple users, but then we're just back to corporate spyware, not tools for helping individuals use their machine more effectively.That said, if I was using my own minio backend, it would be neat to archive my screen captures but I would change it so it captures after, say, every keystroke, and every time my mouse stops moving, and after every click. That way I have high density capture of taking actions, and low density otherwise. In any case collecting the data is not the issue, making an interface where that data becomes useful to help me remember something is.[0] https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/interact-with-text-i...[1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/apis/text-recog...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Hypothesis: the world's most valuable data is screen captures of outlier competent people going about their work. But very little of this data is recorded, let alone made publicly available.It's not quite screen captures, but the way in which any given email is responded to by competent users in your own organization is highly relevant in this context, especially if you place original+reply email pairs into a RAG framework and add function calls for structured domain knowledge.Unified APIs like https://www.nylas.com/ which an admin can unilaterally connect across an entire org can make this quite viable - assuming you've done the work to build a culture where radical transparency is seen as an opportunity rather than a threat.There's a lot of nuance required to avoid hallucinations, but organizations that are merely training chatbots on explicit Q&amp;A documents are just scratching the surface of the depth of their semi-structured data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42596607</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores China's dominance in global manufacturing, arguing that it has emerged as the world's sole manufacturing superpower. It outlines the historical context leading to this rise, including globalization and economic policies that have facilitated China's growth. The discussion highlights key factors such as advancements in technology, labor force dynamics, and government support that have contributed to China's manufacturing prowess. Additionally, the piece examines the implications of this dominance for global supply chains and economic power, raising questions about the future of manufacturing in other nations in response to China's continued ascendance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing people are not aware of and am curious of how big it really is: China manufacturing laundry. Essentially, goods are manufactured in China, then laundered to a third-party country and then exported to the US/EU. This come in two flavors, legal laundry where the local manufacturer satisfies the conditions; and illegal one where bribes are paid to pass goods.&gt; https://antidumping.vn/eu-chinabike-duty-hits-indonesia-mala...I come from a country that does this. Massive deficit with China vs. an equivalent surplus with the EU. Weak manufacturing base that essentially import Chinese, does some packaging and then export it back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh. For all the claims that US manufacturing is down, it does seem that if we adjusted per-capita it's on par with China based on the figures presented here, which I really didn't expect to seeI'm no expert and of course I have no clue if it even makes sense to measure per-capita manufacturing share, and also assume a lot of other factors matter here - what kinds of things we're manufacturing, how much those products serve domestic versus export markets, etc - but it's still surprising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is amazing and filled with facts that i wish everyone arguing the point that china cant overtake U.S. in economy or world superpowers would read. The facts are there, there is not much hiding around the corner, all of the true indication is in front of us. Yes. the article states U.S. still holds the title for world superpower by military size and capabilities. That's not to say that china cant catch up in no time with U.S. military. That's if they decide to do so. i would ask does the Chinese republic need to invest heavy in this sector in order to grow? Clearly not from the facts. in fact that's the very same thing we should have been doing all along.The U.S. has spent enormous amount of capital to fund wars and foreign relational activities.China has a great way going about this. making friends with less developed countries that U.S. overlooked. China is looking for something specific. Just as U.S. is looking for something specific as well. To be totally honest I am not entirely sure what the  U.S. is looking for when engaging with other countries, other than the same narrative for the fear of not having safety blah blah. This time that was spent on these adventures the U.S. cannot get back, while also injuring foreign relations.there is a clear sign that the U.S. government is confused and has a gun with no-where to aim. All the policies and efforts are accelerating the U.S. into deterioration. The U.S. has some strong sector for the sake of this reply i will mainly say that attacking the top tech firms and industries with regulation will only push them out to more favorable grounds give new room for industries to form in more favorable grounds other than U.S.. the solution must solve the problem that brought the solution to existence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592665</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a tool called Transcendental Syntax, designed for analyzing linguistic structures and syntax through an innovative computational framework. It offers a set of algorithms and functionalities that help in understanding the relationships between language components, along with examples and documentation aimed at researchers and developers in the field of computational linguistics. The project is open-source, encouraging contributions and collaboration from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so French that a baguette appeared in my hand after I clicked the theory link. Probably a cognitive hazard to anyone who is really into generics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an implementation of Girard's "transcendental syntax" program which aims to give foundations to logic that do not rely on axiomatics and a form of tarskian semantics (tarskian semantics is the idea that "A &amp; B" is true means that "A" and "B" is true; you've simply changed the and to a "meta" one rather than the logical one). This program is more than 10 years old, with first written versions appearing around 2016, and the ideas appearing in his talks before that.Girard has been a vocal critic of foundational problems, labeling them as "hell levels", with the typical approach of set theory and tarskian semantics as the lowest one and category theory as a "less worse" one (at least one level above). 
One issue with his program is that he mixes abstract, philosophical ideas with technical ones.
So even if some things have interesting technical applications, they may be different when seen from a more philosophical point of view. 
For instance, set theory as the foundations of mathematics is a pretty solid model but it is seen as fundamentally unsatisfying for many reasons -- most famously the continuous hypothesis. Gödel and other very high-profile mathematicians thought it was a very unsatisfying issue even though from a mathematical model theory point of view, it's not even a paradox. 
So the new foundational approaches tend to have maybe deeper philosophical problems about them; for example see Jacob Lurie's critic of the Univalent foundations program (after the "No comment" meme he expressed a long list of issues with it).The other issue with this particular work is that it uses new vocabulary for everything to avoid the bagage of usual mathematical logic, but it kind of give a weird vibe to the work and make it hard to get into without dedicating much work.The result is therefore something that is supposed to solve many longstanding problems in philosophical and technical approaches to the foundations of mathematics but has not had a big impact on the community. This is not too surprising either because the lambda calculus or other logical works were seen as trivial mathematical games. 
We'll see if it's a case of it being too novel to be appreciated fully, and this work seems to try to explore it in a technical way to answer this question.https://girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Logique.html (in French, it gives an overview of the program)https://girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Archives.html (transcendental syntax papers are there in English)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of Girard, I've been very attracted to his ideas about the "dynamics" of logic and "communication without understanding". It always appears to me that such ideas and things like the "execution formula" should have profound implications on static analysis of algorithms and things like abstract interpretation and collapsing stacks of interpreters.Has there been any literature on concrete steps in this direction, or is there anything holding back Girard's theories from practical application (I know that Girard's Geometry of Interaction was supposed to have problems with additives, of which exact implications I do not quite comprehend, which may or may not be relevant)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42589629</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide to recursion, a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It explains the fundamentals of recursion, including how to write recursive functions, the importance of base cases, and common pitfalls to avoid. The article includes practical examples in Python, demonstrating how recursion can be used to simplify code for tasks such as calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci sequences, and traversing data structures. Additionally, it emphasizes the benefits of understanding recursion for developing problem-solving skills and offers exercises to practice the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;- “To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.”
During the months I’ve spent writing this book, I can assure you that this joke gets funnier the more you hear it.I love to read books like this rather than the AI generated slush that seems to be so abundant today. This author has done a great job here. Although I have to say, it is sad that I feel like I have to ‘audit’ everything to see if it’s written by a robot before I invest too much time in it /:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Claiming recursion is taught badly and then trying to teach recursion immediately via call stacks is certainly a choice. The guts of how your favorite compiler implements recursion is hardly what I would call "the correct way" to teach the concept.It's not shocking that students snooze their way through discrete math, try their hardest to forget induction proofs, and the arrive in algorithms or some other higher level class and try their hardest to forget recursion/dynamic programming.The reality is the concepts are hard and demand practice to obtain familiarity. There is no quick path to mathematical maturity. If you try your hardest to phone in induction then surprise surprise recursion is nonsensical to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading "Automate boring stuffs with Python" it helped me a lot while I was in my early college years.I glanced through the initial chapter of this book, and it is so well written even for any newbie to understand.Personally I have had pretty hard time understanding recursion and all the intricacies of it, and still sometimes can't wrap my head around it.Would love to read this book, I have filled the fotm for a review to read the free ebook, hopefully i receive a copy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583181</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "clobbering" in the context of software development, particularly focusing on how certain programming practices can lead to unintended consequences and bugs. It emphasizes the importance of proper code organization and management to prevent issues that arise from overwriting or conflicting data structures. The author provides examples and strategies to avoid these pitfalls, ultimately advocating for better coding habits and awareness among developers to improve software reliability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking as an Asm programmer for several decades: Calling conventions are stupid. They are the results of mindless stupid-compiler-oriented thinking from a time when compilers produced horrible copy-paste-replace code. The CPU itself couldn't care less which registers you use for what. So many wasted bytes on moving values between registers, just because the calling convention wanted it there, and no other reason. The only need to pay attention to calling conventions is when you're interfacing with compiler-generated code. Modern CPUs are fast, but there's still tons of inefficiency in compiler output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GoLang assembly boggles my mind - I understand why it's there, but having looked at it few times makes me wonder if it could've been prevented somehow (I guess not, cryptographic primitives would be way too slow, redirecting them through some kind of ffi would require a shared lib, yada yada yada)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583246</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On my first job, I did some field service work.  I was 17 and it was 1979.  Asteroids appeared in arcades that year, but I had become unbeatable at Space Wars (released in 1977) by then.  The Battlezone video game was released in 1980.One day I visited a computer lab at the Northrop plant (before the Grumman merger) in Hawthorne, CA to upgrade some hardware.  (This location later became the SpaceX headquarters up until they moved to Texas six months ago.)  While in the lab, I saw an F18 cockpit mock up connected to a flight simulator with a vector display.  The computer running it looked like an HP1000 (2100).  While chatting with the nerds in the lab about it, they offered me a chance to fly in it.  I got in, took off, and flew around for a while until I flew past the simulation boundary and it crashed.  After they reset it, I flew a bit more and then tried a landing on the simulated 10,000 foot runway.  I managed to land without crashing into the tank they had placed in the middle of the runway.I saw a very similar looking tank a few years later when I first played Battlezone.  I always wondered if one of the Battlezone developers had "borrowed" the 3D model for it from Northrop.https://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com/2020/04/battlezo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We take games for granted now, but in the early 80s the anticipation of what might be possible was something else. The War Games scene where the magazine ad for an unannounced game motivates Broderick's character to start wardialing all the phones in Sunnyvale felt pretty reasonable.If you read sci-fi, it's akin to the imaginative feelings of space travel and futuristic realities. Back then it was reasonable to imagine that an upcoming game might shift your life into a higher gear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you liked Battlezone back in the day, you can't miss its more modern incarnation: BZFlag.https://www.bzflag.org/Fully Open Source, damn fun, with lots of servers, maps, and different play modes.
Unfortunately the community shrank over the years, and it would benefit a lot from more regular players. Want to take a peek? Then don't miss the 1st 2025 event which is due today at 3 pm EST / 20 UTC. You can login as an observer to watch games, but if you want to play you need to register first at bzflag.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42591818</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article does a great job summarizing the rapid advancements in reasoning and AI agents. Models like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's r1 demonstrate how inference-time compute and structured Chain of Thought (CoT) are pushing LLM capabilities in STEM and coding tasks. The speculation about pivot words and backtracking behavior learned through reinforcement learning is particularly intriguing—it could be transformative for reasoning in domains with external verification.The discussion on agents and moving beyond chat interfaces toward workflows like Cursor resonated with me. A shift in Human-AI interaction paradigms feels essential to unlock the full potential of autonomous agents. However, as the author notes, error rates and cost remain significant hurdles.I've been experimenting with multi-agent systems in Python for the last year and find measuring performance and success one of the hardest parts. While today's LLM agents are still primitive, they already show immense potential. Even without advances in base models, creative agent design patterns could unlock more functionality, and with better reasoning and larger context windows, the possibilities expand even further.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a really well done overview of the evolution of AI in 2024 at a level deeper than just model releases, benchmarks, and agentic systems but digestible by someone at that level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great post but there are some advance terminology that are not that straight-forward in the nitty-details of architectures.. more references would be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42591029</guid></item><item><title>39.

They prefer to bring their ‘whole self’ to projects, focusing on building their own brand and approach rather than managing others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my 15 years in small and mid-sized tech, I've found the most useless managers are senior managers.Good team leads and second line managers can make or break an organization. But they are the least respected roles at a company and gets thrown under the bus first. Most companies don't invest anything in training new managers or setting clear roles and responsibilities for managers.Senior management never faces any accountability but can make big massive changes to an org without consideration for implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is presented as revolutionary, but it’s not clear to me that the results would’ve been any different if they’d surveyed the older generations at the same age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590992</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolving landscape of ANT wireless technology, highlighting its potential decline as various companies pivot towards newer standards like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for device connectivity. It examines the implications for athletes and fitness enthusiasts who rely on ANT-enabled devices for tracking performance and health metrics. The author considers the practical aspects of this transition, including compatibility issues and the future of wearable technology, while emphasizing the need for manufacturers to adapt to maintain relevance in a rapidly changing market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a real shame.BLE and ANT+ are fundamentally different, the latter being a broadcast protocol. You can have any number of devices connected/logging the broadcast of an ANT+ device, while BLE is usually limited to one or two devices. I am sure is not a fundamental limitation of BLE but is the reality for the currently available chipsets.The fact that it is unencrypted is completely irrelevant.My heart rate data over a short period of time is not useful to anyone but myself, and that is the only personal data any of my ANT+ devices broadcast.Unless you consider cadence to be personal information but that is also broadcasted to the world visually and is no more secret than the colour of my running or cycling shorts.The rest of my devices broadcast mechanical, device status and/or environmental data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And there is still no BLE replacement for Garmin "Tempe" sensor: no ultra-small rugged temperature sensor on the market (or I cannot find one! If you could point me to one, I will be very grateful!)On the other hand, all Android phones dropped ANT+ support after approximately Android 9. My old Xiaomi Mi A1 supported ANT+ till some major update, my next phone (Samsung A72) didn't support it from the beginning, my current Pixel 8 Pro doesn't support it too. You need true "head unit" and cannot use phone as one.Hardware is here, but drivers are not installed and cannot be installed from Playstore.It is pity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; They are discontinuing membership programs/fees&gt; They are discontinuing certification programs&gt; They are however continuing to ensure ANT+ is available on silicon&gt; All documentation to be made fully available onlinefunny how "the beginning of the end" kind of sounds excellent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42597395</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of language learning models (LLMs) and the Cursor tool to enhance productivity when completing projects. It highlights how these technologies can assist with tasks such as brainstorming, drafting, and refining content, ultimately streamlining the work process. The author shares practical tips and benefits of integrating LLMs into daily workflows to help individuals and teams finish projects more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding to what another user said here, when using LLMs for heavy prototyping, I also commit frequently and have a document outlining the opinions contained in the repo.One thing I've also been doing now is I have a "template" to use for fullstack applications that's configured out-of-the-box with tech that I like, has linters and hooks set up, as well as is structured in a way that's natural to me. This makes it a lot more likely that the generated code will follow my preferred style. It's also not uncommon that on the first iteration I get some code that's not what I'd like to have in my codebase and I just say "refactor X in this and this way, see &lt;file&gt; for an example" at which point I mostly get code that I'm happy with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AmazingTwo things I would add:1. Use git and commit changes (very) frequently.Often the AI makes a recommendation that looks good, but has consequences 4 or 5 changes later that you'll need to reckon with.  You'll see this especially with web vs. mobile UI behaviours.  Cursor isn't so good at reverting changes yet, and GIT has saved me a LOT of headache.2.  Collaborate with o1 to create a PRD and put it in the same folder as your specs.This increases the likelihood Cursor's recommended changes comply with your intent, style and color guidelines and overall project direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting use case for LLMs. At first, I thought “why complete an MVP if you don’t have time to iterate it?”.But MVPs are a good testbed for determining if something is worth iterating.I build quick prototypes for validation and LLMs have really helped decrease the effort. Here is an example of a site which took me 2 weeks with help from ChatGPT. https://post.withlattice.com/It was enough to get interior designers to start using it, provide feedback, and validate if it’s worth additional time investment.My hypothesis is that 2025 will bring forth a lot of indie products which focus on doing one thing well and can be supported my a small or fractional team.I look forward this break from VC funded and big tech consumer products!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594256</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Twinge of Saudade" by Chal Ravens examines the concept of saudade, a Portuguese term that describes a deep emotional state of nostalgic longing for something or someone that one loves and has lost. Ravens explores how this feeling permeates various aspects of life, culture, and art, drawing connections between saudade and contemporary experiences of loss and yearning. The piece reflects on the implications of saudade in personal identity and collective memory, suggesting that this emotion shapes how individuals relate to their past while influencing their present and future relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, is "saudade" popular enough now that people are using it without explanation? I searched for the term in the article and it doesn't seem to be defined. Extra unexpected because there does not seem to be any connection to a Portuguese-speaking country in the article. Has it reached "hygge" status?Brazilians (my wife included) describe saudade as a sort of deep longing to be back with a loved one in person. Not sure if it's used in all Portuguese-speaking places or just Brazil (or where the term originated for that matter). The translation honestly seems straightforward enough but often when you ask someone to translate, they get that "on the tip of the tongue" look on their face and say English doesn't really have the right words for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who grew up during this era, I find some of the nostalgic preferences of today's culture to be amusing and nearly random.In addition to ABBA, others that come to mind are Queen and Bob Ross. Not that there's anything wrong with these people, but if you were to go back in time and ask around, I think the overall response would be "why them in particular?"Queen, for example, had a few great songs, but Supertramp overall was better band with a similar musical aesthetic. I have no idea why Queen is now considered one of the greatest acts of all time, while Supertramp is more or less forgotten.ABBA had a bunch of lite rock/pop hits, but to see them talked about seriously in The London Review of Books in 2025 is downright hilarious to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; a Sweden then known to outsiders chiefly for Ingmar Bergman,Arrgh, the flashbacks. Sometimes I regret the extinction of European movie studios, but then there are these examples of ponderous depressing twaddle ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569582</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My spouse is a psychotherapist, and from her 10+ years of work I have seen that it can work very well. But the success depends on the patient’s mental attitude. If you go to a therapist with the mindset „here I am, do something that I feel better (again)“, then I can guarantee you you‘ll be disappointed. A psychotherapist is like a midwife who can help a woman in giving birth to a child, but the woman must go through the process herself, through the pain, the labour. But when you come with the right mindset, do the work, do not expect quick fixes, the results can be transformative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d like to read on actual techniques, cause this post makes me suspicious. That question “how do I feel about it” is only a first step in a complex approach and the focus on it may suggest that there’s something missing in my picture. Which is lots of circumstantial techniques and ideas. I wouldn’t think of pointing this particular question out from all that if I was writing a blog post. Maybe I’m just different?Anyway, I agree when they say that people who need therapy the most are the ones who cannot afford it. It makes you think different, not just pat you on the head and commiserate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try group therapy! It can significantly change your life. I was saying "no fucking way" whenever my psychiatrist suggested it, but after I tried, it turned my life upside down in the best possible way. It will be very uncomfortable first, but worth it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584373</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;In the article, the author, Ann Telnaes, explains her decision to leave The Washington Post after years as a political cartoonist. She reflects on the challenges faced in the current media landscape, including editorial constraints and a diminishing commitment to political satire. Telnaes expresses concerns about the erosion of journalistic integrity and the pressures of commercialism that ultimately influenced her departure, highlighting the importance of independent voices in media. Her move signifies a desire for creative freedom and a more impactful platform for her work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the current political situation in the US is going to accelerate the demise of traditional media. They have not been able to adapt to a changing information landscape and were stuck on models that worked in the past, like "both sides"ing issues sort of reflexively. That works great with a lot of things like "how much should we tax companies?", but not so much for some more fundamental questions like whether someone supports democracy.I'm not sure what will emerge in its place. It's a big problem, and has hit hardest and first among local newspapers which are increasingly hollowed out husks of their former selves. This has a real cost to society that's actually quantifiable in dollars and cents:https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-closures-of-local-new...Things like social media don't really take the place of people paid to do the hard work of, say, sitting through local city council meetings and making sense of what's happening there. A friend of mine tried doing that for fun and it lasted a few years, but he got burned out because of the tremendous amount of work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the cartoonist's principled stance, but she greatly overestimates how free the press is (or was) just because she'd never had a point of view censored. In the words of Noam Chomsky:I don't say you're self-censoring - I'm sure you believe everything you're saying; but what I'm saying is, if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.Yes, her viewpoint wasn't censored up until now, but on the other hand, the Washington Post sure didn't employ anyone remotely similar to e.g. Jared Taylor or Keith Woods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is such an innocuous cartoon. I can't believe it would be an issue in this age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42591221</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a new non-invasive method for monitoring blood sugar levels using a wearable device that fits on the wrist, eliminating the need for needles. This innovative technology measures glucose levels through the skin, aiming to improve the lives of those with diabetes by providing a more comfortable and convenient monitoring option. The device integrates advanced sensors and algorithms to deliver accurate readings, potentially transforming diabetes management and enhancing adherence to monitoring routines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Currently, diabetics must frequently prick their fingers or rely on invasive wearable patches with micro-needles to track their blood-sugar levelsType 1 diabetic here - for what it's worth, CGMs aren't particularly invasive. At least in comparison to the many many years of finger pricking! But a smart watch solution would be cool. (I actually do get my CGM readings on my smart watch, which is really nice!)I know Apple has also worked on this stuff in the past, but from what I remember the accuracy wasn't good enough to be safe for diabetics. I'd be really curious to see accuracy stats on this in comparison to Dexcom and Freestyle CGMs.I would definitely be excited to use something like this, but for me, the biggest quality of life improvements for me will be continued improvements with closed loop CGM + insulin pump systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We - at DiaMonTech - are working on non-invasive glucose monitoring for over a decade now. It's a hard and complex problem and as long as clinical data is missing, I'm very sceptical.We just reached (in a clinical trial) a comparable accuracy as early-stage invasive devices that got FDA approved with a shoe-box-sized device and we still have some work to do. The pre-print of our publication is here: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5289491/v1I'm excited to see new developments but in this case, I'm not sure this will reach the market anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sounds exciting, but the fact their prototype is in a wristwatch form factor makes me wonder if it's aiming to be more of a media showpiece to hype investment valuation from those industry partners.  Forward looking statements like "maybe we'll make it monitor blood pressure too" don't help.Even at the size of a brick, or without conveniently hiding the power supply off-camera, forgoing needles would still be a huge boon to diabetics.  Why not get the concept working and demo some hard stats, then miniaturize?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599189</guid></item><item><title>2.

Can we have a new process for good government too, please?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be happy if we just put recyclable materials in their own corner of the landfills marked "TODO"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42598458</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I worked at arXiv one of my coworkers was a fresh astrophysics PhD who was cynical about the state of the field.  He thought that we didn't know what the hell was going on with accretion disks but that a few powerful people in the field created the impression that we did and that there was no dissent because it was so difficult to get established in the field.When I first saw the ΛCDM model my first impression was that I'd didn't believe it,  it seemed bad enough to have dark matter that we didn't understand (though WIMPs and axions are plausible) but adding equally mysterious and physically unmotivated dark energy made it seem just an exercise in curve fitting.There have been a longstanding problem that the history of the universe and cosmological distance scale haven't made sense.https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/the-hubble-tension-sti...When I was getting my PhD in condensed matter physics I was going to the department colloquium all the time and seeing astrophysics talks about how some people thought the hubble constant was 40 km/s/Mpc and others thought it was 80 km/s/Mpc.  With timescape cosmology maybe they were both right.Another longstanding problem in astronomy is that since the 1970s it's been clear we have no idea of how supermassive black holes could have formed in the time we think the universe has existed.  With the JWST there are a flood of results that show the first 500 million years of the universe probably lasted a lot more than 500 million yearshttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac9b22&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here’s an extended comment by another astrophysicst: https://telescoper.blog/2025/01/02/timescape-versus-dark-ene...The most important bit:&gt; The new papers under discussion focus entirely on supernovae measurements. It must be recognized that these provide just one of the pillars supporting the standard cosmology. Over the years, many alternative models have been suggested that claim to “fix” some alleged problem with cosmology only to find that it makes other issues worse. That’s not a reason to ignore departures from the standard framework, but it is an indication that we have a huge amount of data and we’re not allowed to cherry-pick what we want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading this as a layman, it looks like releasing ΛCDM's cosmological principle [1] reveals the nontrivial temporal effects mass clusters have via general relativity. As a result, there could be empty regions of space in which billions of years more have elapsed than in e.g. a galaxy. This not only changes how we interpret supernova data (the acceleration isn't generally happening, but an artefact of looking through space which is older than our own), but may also negate the need for dark matter (EDIT: dark energy) and the meaning of a single age of our univese.(I'm also vaguely remembering a multi-universe model in which empty space inflates quicker than massed space.)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42566748</guid></item><item><title>4.

It’s a big improvement in privacy for the user.

The problem is that its properties and values were named by a committee, so they aren't intuitive to anyone who wasn't involved in the long proceedings that led up to the spec being written. You try to remember which one is justify-content, which one is align-items, and so forth, and just give up and try everything until something seems to work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know others have already mentioned it, but i've recommended https://flexboxfroggy.com/ to others before and they quickly picked it up.This is another good one for learning css grid https://cssgridgarden.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I highly recommend Josh's guide: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox...It goes over more advanced gotchas and tips in detail such as flex-basis, auto margins, min-width, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600586</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal works, detailing the challenges posed by NAT in establishing peer-to-peer connections. It discusses the importance of protocols like STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) in facilitating communication between devices behind NATs. The blog also highlights Tailscale's solution using wireguard to create secure connections while navigating NAT issues, allowing devices to connect seamlessly even in restrictive network environments. Overall, the piece emphasizes the significance of effective NAT traversal for improving network connectivity and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent article!The tribal knowledge seems to be that you shouldn't do TCP-based hole punching because it's harder than UDP. The author acknowledges this:&gt; You can do NAT traversal with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending on how deep you want to go.However, I only see marginally added complexity (given the already complex UDP flows). IMO this complexity doesn't justify discarding TCP hole punching altogether. In the article you could replace raw UDP packets to initiate a connection with TCP SYN packets plus support for "simultaneous open" [0].This is especially true if networks block UDP traffic which is also acknowledged:&gt; For example, we’ve observed that the UC Berkeley guest Wi-Fi blocks all outbound UDP except for DNS traffic.My point is that many articles gloss over TCP hole punching with the excuse of being harder than UDP while I would argue that it's almost equally feasible with marginal added complexity.[0] https://ttcplinux.sourceforge.net/documents/one/tcpstate/tcp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinatingly effective, but maybe I'm the only one getting the heebie-jeebies when someone suggests implementing this in production corp networks. Sure it's super convenient, but the thought of bypassing all traditional NATs and firewalls, and instead relying solely on a software ACL, seems super risky. Maybe I just don't understand how it works, but it seems that a bad actor getting access to a stray VM with Tailscale on it in, say, your AWS testing env, essentially has an clear path all the way into your laptop on the internal corp network, through the kernel, into user space and into the Tailscale ACL code as the sole arbiter of granting or blocking access. Would I even know someone unauthorized made it that far?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was a tailscale-like equivalent without connectivity encryption, for devices which encrypt at the application layer (like almost the entire internet does). We don't always need the lower layers to be encrypted, this is especially computationally expensive for low power devices (think IoT stuff running a tailscale like tunnel).GRE tunnels exist and I actually use them extensively, but UDP hole punching is not handled so hub-and-spoke architecture is needed for them, no peer to peer meshes with GRE (ip fou).Are there equivalent libraries out there which do UDP hole punching and unencrypted GRE tunnels following an encrypted handshake to confirm identity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600846</guid></item><item><title>7.

I understand they don't allow 'free climbing' any more... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgO4Gd4RhvM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He sort of touched on this, but an aspect of tower rigging that most people don’t think about is how long it can take to climb a tower when you are the first one up with the line. It’s absolutely exhausting work.Another side fact, wasps are attracted to building nests on the towers for some reason. I never knew if it was all the EM radiation being put off or just the heat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have to check out the author's other youtube videos exploring this tower in depth.

It brings so much benefit—and so much convenience, from its flexibility—but it is in its fundamental glow-y rectangular nature that sucks us in, crushing our attention, posture, and so much else. Was incredibly fun to experiment with something radically different.Excited to see where things go from here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had this same idea since I also own a thermal printer, but I could never get past the wastefulness of printing a piece of paper that I would then immediately throw away after reading, so I never implemented it. I still think about it periodically: there is something oddly alluring about finding a small piece of paper made specifically for me whenever I go to the kitchen in the morning. E-ink just doesn't quite feel the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please be aware that handling thermal paper is super unhealthy: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5453537/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599599</guid></item><item><title>9.

This isn't special until evals show it producing consistent results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there will be lessons learned here as well for better agentic systems writing code more generally; instead of “committing” to code as of the first token generated, first generate overall structure of code base, with abstractions, and only then start writing code.I usually instruct Claude/chatGPT/etc not to generate any code until I tell it to, as they are eager to do so and often box themselves in a corner early on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601847</guid></item><item><title>10.

I just haven't updated my own website in quite a while :/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't keep a "dick bar" that sticks to the top of the page to remind you which site you're on. Your browser is already doing that for you.A variation of this is my worst offender, the flapping bar. Not only it takes space, it flaps every time I adjust my overscroll by pulling back, and it covers the text I was trying to adjust. The hysteresis to hide it back is usually too big and that makes you potentially overscroll again.Special place in hell for those who hide the flap on scroll-up but show it again when the scroll inertia ends, without even pulling back.Can’t say here what I think about people who do the above, but you can imagine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another one: No "Sign in with your Google account" popup covering the upper right corner of the page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599102</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a notorious Markdown critic, I have to say, their syntax really looks like a decent attempt of support for technical and scientific documents. Having used reStructuredText for a thesis with a lot of bells and whistles, and having used org-mode mostly ever since, I am not just admitting it willy-nilly. Then of course some of its syntax and syntax concepts are straight out of reStructuredText's book, so it makes sense, that it would inherit the capabilities as well.What I haven't seen at a quick glance is the ability to link to any place in the document (sink) from withing the document itself (source). Maybe I did not look far enough in the examples. reStructuredTex can do this, and org-mode can do that too. And I don't mean just linking to existing headings. The other required things like footnotes and citations and so on seem to be there. Now if this reaches mainstream and we start writing documentation in it, there is great potential to have finally good documentation, not limited by the likes of github markdown. Of course same is true for reStructuredText and org-mode. From that perspective, one could ask, why yet another format was necessary, rather than improving tooling for lets say reStructuredText.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've really had a pet peeve about footnotes on mobile and this does the crime. If you click a footnote and it jumps very far away and doesn't have a return navigation, I have left your page usually after the second time I see a footnote and didn't note my exact scroll. A small thing but pretty please don't make me have to hunt for where I was...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No relation to the best-selling 90's PC game "Myst", in case anyone was wondering like I was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42573388</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sold a laptop on eBay once long, long ago. Someone did the "Buy it now" option but never paid. I'm trying to remember the exact situation (probably more than 10 years ago), but I had exchanged messages with him several times and he always had an excuse to not pay.Then I noticed he was selling the exact same model of laptop so it was easy for me to realize that he had just "bought" my laptop to remove the listing so it wouldn't compete against his. I messaged ebay support to accuse him but they didn't do anything about it.Since he had made the order, eBay did show me his shipping information so I ordered a "glitter bomb" which was basically glitter in a tube with a spring. I got a very nasty accusatory email from him, but it was very vague. He wouldn't specify what he received, but that he was smart enough to not open it. That's how I knew he got the full effect.I just replied something to the effect of "You never paid me. Why would I send something to you?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fair number of years ago now, I had a business idea and bought a domain. Within a couple hours I had a person email me offering me $250 for the domain. I countered with $2,000 saying I would have to rebrand. I'd really done literally nothing but buy the domain at that point, but I wasn't interested in selling and it was a "Go Away" price. They accepted.Used a well known Escrow site. Took a couple days to settle. Quickest $2,000 I ever made. I found out later they were some crypto company with a similar name. They bought it from me just to squat. They still squat it.I probably could have made way more if I had pushed the issue, oh well.Never really built much more than a proof of concept for my business idea and never found another domain I liked enough to buy for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't have a great opinion of marketing in general and therefore I'm often unconvinced with arguments like "marketing is about fulfilling a customer's needs" or "adding efficiency to the market".Therefore I feel vindicated when a moderately-upvoted post says the quiet part out loud, namely, "Yeah, we made a fake post and just lied to everyone on the internet. I'm not sorry, because not only was it popular - it became the top post of the day."Remember, kids: lying is only wrong when it's unprofitable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600595</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;in terms of invention, sailors had been wearing bell bottoms since the US Navy introduced them 1817 and sailors tromping around seaport cities would have been more of an every day event through WWII. That US Navy uniform is informally called "Cracker Jacks"https://www.shopthesalvationarmy.com/Listing/Details/2645572...They were intended to allow sailors to roll their pants up above the knee while swabbing the deckshttps://www.wearethemighty.com/mighty-trending/this-is-why-t...But we can see "bell bottomed trousers" referenced in popular culture in the 1940's, here's Louis Prima's band doing the song Bell Bottomed Trousershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QXmdbc5sx0and here's a painting used for the sheet musichttps://fineartamerica.com/featured/bell-bottom-trousers-alb...https://www.ecrater.com/p/42407644/vintage-1944-bell-bottom-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Caserta&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great piece.  This subculture has been overanalyzed to death, but the early roots were very humble indeed, and the spirit of entrepreneurship this woman possessed was quite real and strong.  Circumstances and tragedy unfortunately short-circuited her trajectory, yet she made a lasting impact, and it seems she found grace in her stride again through her final chapters.My parents had at least one Janis Joplin record and each dipped their toes into the hippie scene, so I was aware of it early on.  Bell-bottom jeans were reviled by many in my early youth - including me - but by the time I was in high school, I started to see the appeal in more than one way.  I helped create a fake video news report on Woodstock as part of some kind of A/V class.  I took acid.  I listened to the Grateful Dead tapes a friend had acquired through the still robust tape-trading scene going at the time (incidentally, some of my favorite background music lately has been some instrumental-only jam collections posted by gratefuldeadosaurusrex on YT, check it out if you're so inclined).Only a tiny percentage of baby boomers were actually significantly involved in hippie culture, even during its height.  Like nearly everything truly special, it got overblown.  Despite its exaggerated presence and oft-deserved mixed reception, though, there was something important about it.  There's a reason so many keep going back to take another look.  I think it's wise for some of us to continue sifting through the remnants to find what's worth holding on to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569880</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses implementing long polling in a Node.js application using PostgreSQL as the database. It explains the concept of long polling, which allows a server to hold a request open until new data is available, enhancing real-time communication by reducing the number of requests needed. The piece provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up the environment, configure PostgreSQL for polling, and write the necessary Node.js code to handle incoming requests while interacting with the database. It emphasizes performance considerations and offers insights on optimizing the solution for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long polling has some problems of its own.Second Life has an HTTPS long polling channel between client and server. It's used for some data that's too bulky for the UDP connection, not too time sensitive, or needs encryption. This has caused much grief.On the client side, the poller uses libcurl. Libcurl has timeouts. If the server has nothing to send for a while, libcurl times out. The client then makes the request again.
This results in a race condition if the server wants to send something between timeout and next request. Messages get lost.On top of that, the real server is front-ended by an Apache server. This just passes through relevant requests, blocking the endless flood of junk HTTP requests from scrapers, attacks, and search engines. Apache has a timeout, and may close a connection that's in a long poll and not doing anything.Additional trouble can come from middle boxes and proxy servers that don't like long polling.There are a lot of things out there that just don't like holding an HTTP connection open. Years ago, a connection idle for a minute was fine. Today, hold a connection open for ten seconds without sending any data and something is likely to disconnect it.The end result is an unreliable message channel. It has to have sequence numbers to detect duplicates, and can lose messages. For a long time, nobody had discovered that, and there were intermittent failures that were not understood.In the original article, the chart section labelled "loop" doesn't mention timeout handling. That's not good.
If you do long polling, you probably need to send something every few seconds to keep the connection alive.
Not clear what a safe number is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Articles like this make me happy to use Phoenix and LiveView every day. My app uses WebSockets and I don’t think about them at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unrelated to the topic in the article…    await new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 500));

In Node.js context, it's easier to:    import { setTimeout } from "node:timers/promises";
    await setTimeout(500);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600276</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For instance, compared to an EUV system employing a 250-watt light source, Canon estimates NIL consumes just one-tenth the energy.I'm not an expert on this but feel like a 250w light is not the major driver of cost in EUV? Or am I misunderstanding this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had many experiments with nanoimprint lithography at the university 20 years ago. The resolution was poor and the durability very poor. After dozens of imprints the “stamps” degraded heavily. I am curious if 20 years were enough to fix all the issues and it’s really competitive today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP states that this can go down to 14nm. What I am interested in is whether older and larger processes (say ~50nm) can be done at a much cheaper cost than traditional methods.A lot of stuff simply does not require the most advanced chips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575111</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I played around with this in a VM the last time it was mentioned on HN.The thing I want to do, but wasn't able to find a way to accomplish was to have a virtual desktop switcher gadget and a separate gadget to swallow minimized applications where each can be placed independently on the screen (and preferably auto hide)-- this will be separate application(s) from Labwc, but I did not find anything for Wayland that could do this (I do not like the MS Windows style task bar with menus, desktop switcher, etc., in one single bar).Anyone have any suggestions?Another nice to have would be to have screen edge bindings, where moving the mouse pointer or dragging a window over an edge, or corner, of the screen can be made to take an action. I'm not sure if this could even be accomplished with a stand-alone utility under Wayland, or if this must be done by the compositor.  But, if possible, and anyone knows of something that exists, I am all ears.One of the things I liked with labwc is that you can have traditional X style application menus by right-click/left-clicking the root window (it is not the default, but was easy to setup).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; it cannot be controlled with dbus, sway/i3-IPC or other technology. The reason for this is that we believe that custom IPCs and protocols create a fragmentation that hinders general Wayland adoption.If anything, this leads to more fragmentation since now you have to hack your own way to control it, rather than using something standard (at least on Linux) like dbus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is also wayboxhttps://github.com/wizbright/wayboxGlad these 2 projects exist since I would want fvwm (prefered) or a fluxbox clone under wayland when I am forced to move&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42597283</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now, we have to get a little philosophical here. In my eyes, RE is like a game of minesweeper. You start with an empty field not knowing the state of any of the cells, i.e. not knowing whether each individual cell contains a landmine or not. When you discover the state of a cell, you have the context to deduce the state of its neighbor cells. In minesweeper, you don’t have a particular direction in which you progress. You never say “In this game of minesweeper, I want to go up no matter what”, you just let the numbers nudge you in the direction that is the easiest to go in at the moment. I assert that this is also true for RE. Once you find out what a function or a variable does, you suddenly understand a little more about functions and variables that depend on the ones whose meaning you’ve just inferred. It may be beneficial not to set any particular goal with an RE project, and instead letting the complex network of intertwined functions and variables guide you towards understanding the system as a whole.That's such a nice way to think about it. Maybe I should try giving RE a go again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great project, write-up, and sense of humor in the videos!&gt; Using that part number I wasn’t able to find any information about the chip online apart from an article that claimed it was based around a “SuperH” CPU core – an ISA that I’ve encountered for the first time ever in that article.Also found in Sega 32x, Sega Saturn, and Sega Dreamcast! And some early Pocket PCs (turn-of-the-century handhelds running Windows CE) like the HP Jornada series, although most Pocket PCs were ARM-based.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is such a ludicrous premise, I'm amazed you pulled it off.You mention "another packing optimization". I'm wondering, how are you transferring frames? The dot matrix is eight 7x5 characters, i.e. 280 bits in total, which amounts to 40 7-bit groups per frame. You seem to be using twice that space in transmission, is it wasted on some control data or is the transmission just slightly suboptimal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600349</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ownership of copyrights in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and the implications of different ownership structures. It highlights various perspectives on who should hold copyright—individual developers, organizations, or the community—and examines the potential impact on software development, licensing, and access. The piece argues for a balanced approach that considers the rights and motivations of contributors while ensuring the sustainability and accessibility of FOSS projects. It also addresses the legal complexities and encourages further dialogue on copyright ownership in the FOSS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who wants GPL enforcement, I still say don't sign a CLA, for two reasons:- Centralizing copyright ownership in a single entity grants that entity the ability to lock down the project at any time and defeat the copyleft (e.g. Oracle killing off OpenSolaris). I consider this a worse outcome than a copyleft that is unenforced. It also encourages malicious enforcement (e.g. Oracle v. Google) that runs contrary to the goals of FOSS.- Due to some very specific peculiarities of US law, regular users can sue companies that don't follow the GPL, because the source code disclosure requirement makes you a third-party beneficiary of the copyright license (which in US law is a contract).The last one is a bit unfair to the article because the rulings in question happened after it was published. But it obviates the biggest benefit of centralized ownership - clear and unambiguous standing to sue. If things were the opposite - i.e. the courts said third-party beneficiaries can't sue and only owners can - then there would be an argument for keeping ownership of critical parts of the project in an entity with no conflict of interest against enforcement.Even then, I don't see why ownership has to be centralized. Under US law, joint owners of a single copyrighted work both have standing to sue. Having more owners means more people with standing. In lieu of a classic CLA with a single point of failure, you could have a policy of accepting any code that is either owned by the developer itself (after their employment contracts have been vetted) or any of a number of trustworthy FOSS organizations who are committed to enforcing GPL. All parties would have standing to sue individually and could additionally sue as a class in a single action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My new rule is to never contribute and do my best to avoid using any free software that requires a CLA. Shared copyright ownership is very important to maintaining software freedoms. It makes it impossible for a single party to change the license in ways counter to the communities desires. There have been many recent examples of this sort of bad behavior that have driven this point home for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When you take a job, in most places in the world, by default, your employer owns and/or effectively controls all your copyrights.Is this really true? I haven't checked my employment agreement, but I'm pretty sure that my employer only controls the copyrights for a) work I do for them, and b) any other side work I happen to do in my employer's field (which never happens).AFAIK, work I do on my own that is unrelated to my employer belongs to me, and I've never had anyone from my job try to assert otherwise. (I have plenty of publicly-visible code on GitHub that they could glom onto if they wanted, although none of it is commercially important.)---Edit: My employee agreement says "I understand that the 
provisions this Agreement requiring assignment of Company Work Product do not apply to any Non-Company Work Product that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, or any similar state invention law."That labor code says "Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the 
employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the 
employer."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580397</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Blur Busters Open Source Display Initiative, which aims to improve the clarity of motion on LCD displays through the use of refresh cycle shaders. These shaders address the issues of motion blur and ghosting that can occur during fast-moving scenes. By utilizing techniques like variable refresh rates and backlight strobing, the initiative seeks to create a more visually pleasing experience for gamers and viewers alike. The website also emphasizes community collaboration and open-source development to drive innovation in display technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it some elaborate joke?Don't visual effects people go to lots of effort to add motion blur? Why would you want to remove it?Why are they trying to simulate old CRT displays?Can someone explain what this is about?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this a new method that simulates a CRT and genuinely reduces motion blur on any type of higher framerate displays, starting a 120hz. But it doesn't dim the image like black frame insertion which is the only current method that comes close to the clarity of a CRT. But it also simulates other aspects of CRT displays, right?Can you use this method just to reduce blur without reducing brightness, on any game? They mention reducing blur for many things other than retro games in "Possible Use Cases of Refresh Cycle Shaders" but does reducing blur in a flight simulator also make it visually look like a CRT with phosphors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With about half of the screen is black, can it also boost FPS by not  spending GPU time on pixels in those areas if integrated deep into engine?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599696</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study on the effectiveness of AI-generated spear phishing emails. It details an experiment where participants were targeted with emails created with the help of artificial intelligence, comparing their responses to those generated by humans. The findings reveal that AI-generated phishing campaigns can be highly effective, with a significant portion of participants engaging with the emails. The study emphasizes the increasing sophistication of AI in crafting deceptive communications and highlights the importance of developing better defenses against such threats to improve cybersecurity awareness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

A few minutes after payment, I received an email asking to click to confirm it was me.It came from verify@verification.metamail.com, with alert@nofraud.com cc. All red flags for phishing.I googled it because it had all the purchase information, so unless a malicious actor infiltrated Meta servers, it has to be right. And it was, after googling a bit. But why do they do such things?i would expect better from Meta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That, after thirty years, email security still depends on the wisdom of individuals not clicking the wrong link, is appalling.The situation involves institutions happy to opaque links to email as part of their workflow. What could change this? All I can imagine is state regulation but that also is implausible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This lines up well with the success rates I have seen from expert phishers. When I worked at a certain well known company with strong security, a demon called Karla would succeed at spearphishing a bit over 50% of the security team.AI now means much less skilled people can be as good as she was. Karla as a Service. We are doomed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601681</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent scientific discovery regarding comb jellies, which are capable of fusing with one another to create a single organism, effectively merging their bodies and genetic material. Researchers have found that this unique behavior may provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of multicellularity. The study highlights how this fusion process allows comb jellies to adapt and thrive in their environments, raising questions about the implications for understanding other biological systems and the evolution of complex life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

Or do they eventually grow back the missing parts and split up again?- If they do split up again, do both individuals wait for the other one to completely heal before splitting? If one side started off less damaged and healed faster, can it abandon/reject the other side without waiting for the other side to completely heal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant if you like these creatures, an article on how an aquarium managed to raise them: https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/stories/growing-jellies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better understanding of the mechanisms of allorecognition would be huge for transplant surgeries.For people trying to decide between death and transplant, possibly being able to tune down human-twitchy self identification would be amazing.To say nothing of those with autoimmune disorders, most of which have horrific symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564243</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses techniques for intercepting system calls (syscalls) in operating systems, particularly focusing on the use of software tools and debugging utilities to modify or monitor the behavior of applications at the syscall level. It covers various methods such as using `ptrace`, `LD_PRELOAD`, and custom kernel modules to intercept and manage syscalls, while also addressing the security implications and potential use cases for these techniques, including debugging, profiling, and enhancing application performance. The author provides practical examples and insights into the architecture of syscalls, emphasizing the importance of understanding these low-level operations for developers and security researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially for syscalls where the information you want isn't directly in the parameters - e.g. for strings. You have to do some crazy stuff to make that work.Especially annoying because it only supports cBPF (Classic BPF) which is very limited compared to eBPF. Apparently they aren't ever going to add eBPF to more things since it is such a security risk.You may want to look into this if your use-case is not security sensitive: https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/syscall-user-dispatch.ht...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602603</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant breakthrough in hacking the Raspberry Pi RP2350, where a hacker successfully accessed the one-time programmable (OTP) secret by exploiting glitches in the RISC-V cores, which allowed them to enable debugging capabilities. This accomplishment raises concerns regarding the security of the RP2350, as it showcases vulnerabilities that can be exploited, highlighting the ongoing challenges in protecting hardware from sophisticated hacking techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599971"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was a cool talk. The attacker used a well timed glitch on voltage supply pin shared by the USB peripheral and OTP (one time programable) memory which unlike the CPU power isn't protected by hardware glitch detectors. Instead the BootROM code does multiple validating reads to both known test values and the configuration bits. The glitch is timed to allow the test values to be read, but cuts power while reading the configuration bits. This causes test value to persist.It jus happens that the test value represents an invalid, but useful, configuration (both ARM and RISC-V cores disabled). The chip power on state machine boots the RISC-V cores in this case instead of hanging the start-up sequence. Since the RISC-V cores don't have a secure enclave mode their debug interface is always accessible if a RISC-V core is selected.The chip reset state machine is also partly under the control of software, because it's used to wakeup the chip from deep sleep modes. So the RISC-V cores (or their debug interface) can be used enable the ARM debug interface and perform a partial reset from beyond the point the state machine would disable the ARM debug interface, but early enough to reset everything else.It's my understanding there can be no pure software fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a repost of the 38C3 talk by Aedan Cullen:https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-hacking-the-rp2350Aedan references a presentation earlier on Day 1 of 38C3 about hardware fault injection of the ACE3 USB-C controller in Apple hardware: https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-ace-up-the-sleeve-hacking-into-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is wrong. The author glitched the IP block with the one time programmable fuses in conjunction with logic that uses those fuse bits, not the RISC-V cores themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599971</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creator of Wildcard here! Neat to see this pop up on HN after several years. As others have noted, this project isn't under active development anymore.One reason: while I still think there's great potential in browser extensions, I ultimately felt limited by scraping and fetching bits of data from a server, and grew more interested in a deeper overhaul of how we build applications in order to locate more data on the client. Eg: check out this demo [1] of a Wildcard-esque data manipulation but in an app that stores all its data in a client-side database. I'm still continuing this work today, exploring "local-first" architectures at the Ink &amp; Switch research lab, in support of malleable customizable interfaces.It would be interesting to revisit Wildcard now that LLMs exist—I suspect that many of the scraping parts (building "site adapters" in Wildcard parlance) would be far more possible to automate now. A few years ago we explored some semi-automated programming-by-example interactions for scraping [2] but the friction was always really noticeable without any AI support.[1]: https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/#data-centric-design-e...[2]: https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/Joker-LIVE-2022.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat! Seems that development has stopped in 2020 though :-( https://github.com/geoffreylitt/wildcard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the idea of having a plug-in spreadsheet on every website, so I can work with the data without having to do any scraping or programming.Unfortunately, it looks like the project was abandoned after the initial talk and paper in 2020.I assume that we'll get there soon with small LLMs running directly in the browser (like Gemini nano) that will make it easy to query/structure website data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585447</guid></item><item><title>27.

Apparently, it’s because the China government directly mandated it, so Akamai had no choice but to transfer their business to domestic China providers. For example, PSN is now being handled by Tencent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; All current China CDN customers must complete the transition to our Partners’ solution by June 30, 2026...Can anyone here who works in the field shed some light on why it takes a whole 1.5 years for such a change to take effect?What's involved in a CDN transition that can't be done in, say, 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42603585</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really hope guide-level docs are on the roadmap for Axum. The current situation of "here are some (third-party) blog posts and YouTube videos" is not greatly encouraging.

Now I'm using Rust with Axum/Tokio/Tower/Hyper (web server), Leptos (SSR using "Islands" flag, which also allows WASM generation for front end; JSX-like syntax), and Diesel (ORM and query builder that expects you define your schema using raw SQL).

&lt;p&gt;The article details the evolution of tunnel boring machines (TBMs), highlighting their historical development, technological advancements, and various designs used in construction projects. It discusses early tunneling methods, the introduction of mechanized tunneling in the mid-20th century, and the transition to more sophisticated, efficient TBMs that enhance safety and productivity in tunnel construction. Additionally, the article examines different types of TBMs, such as earth pressure balance and slurry shield machines, and their applications in various geological conditions, showcasing the impact of TBMs on infrastructure development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite TBMs being used all the time it is genererally much cheaper to build a tunnel by cut and cover - that is  just call in excovators and dig a hole then cover it. when an excavator breaks you push it aside and get another until it is fixed. Want to go faster - just hire more excavators the overall cost is the same since you are done faster.tbms are cheaper if you must go deep, but deep is a negative for subways since people must get down which takes time (faster is always better).It is claimed that cut and cover is toa much surface disruption - but cut and cover is much faster and so the disruption to any one place can be quick enough. Better to manage disruption than eliminate it.when a tbm breaks your project is delayed while you wait for parts and then fix it in place.Tbms do go under everything else, but experience proves you can find things and go around them quick enough (sometimes there is a delay as somethingeof archeological interest is found - but evperience shows this is still cheaper than a TBM.Yes TBMs are cool and useful but the simple shoud not be over looked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to mention a recent extension to Berlin‘s subway system right in the middle of the city, in swampy ground and below a canal. They injected „freeze lances“ into the ground, turned 43,000 m^3 of mud into an ice block and then carved their way through it. Absolutely amazing engineering, I think planned and executed by a Swiss company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it doesn’t seem to be mentioned here, but has there been some major recent change in the economics of the _scale_ of the tunnels? Dublin’s beleaguered metro project recently put out its new design; there are a bunch of changes from the previous early-noughties design, but one of the more eyebrow-raising ones is that the bored sections will now be a single _9.5 meter diameter_ tunnel; it is claimed that this is less disruptive and cheaper than the two-narrow-tunnel approach used in conventional bored metros. Recent metro lines is Barcelona and Madrid have also used the single-giant-tunnel approach.Anyone know what’s going on here? Intuitively you’d expect two small tunnels to be cheaper; you’re moving a lot less material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600979</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the floating-point unit (FPU) of the Pentium processor and its implementation in ROM (Read-Only Memory). It explains the architecture of the Pentium’s FPU, particularly the significance of the lookup tables used for floating-point operations, and highlights the importance of these ROM-based computations for performance. The article dives into the technical details, including how the FPU processes instructions and the impact of its design on calculations. It also explores the historical context and provides insights into the engineering choices that shaped the architecture of the Pentium processor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ah, bitter sweet memories. a very long time ago I was working on a hw accelerated 2D api, and spent some time on this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny timing on this post, I just finished implementing this a couple days ago for a little effect in a game. I followed the math in this comment that is now only viewable from the archive http://web.archive.org/web/20190614093605/https://forum.libc...I notice you use 4 triangles per segment but I believe it's always possible to use only 2 if you only have miter and bevel caps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used something close to this to implement a whiteboard marker with texture and transparency. If your browser supports WebGL, feel free to try https://limnu.com/d/new.html (BTW It’s a multi-player whiteboard you can share &amp; collab.) Is that a shameless plug? I’m not involved anymore and won’t make any money, but I’m proud of the implementation, and happy if the current stewards of the site get some traffic or business.Aside from that, for the sake of discussion and playing devil’s advocate I’ll take a small pedantic issue with the very first sentence. There are multiple ways to do this kind of thing without triangulating. (And I’m currently working on making one available publicly.) Clever shaders are one way to render lines without triangles. Ray tracing is another. Triangles are useful and easy and have broad support, so they make sense, but they aren’t the only option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42589054</guid></item><item><title>32. 60 Years of Spaceflight Patches</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/</link><description>

I'd post a picture but it is in storage right now.  It's stuck on a poster of a Space Shuttle.I was lucky enough to get a lot of access to shuttle crews and missions because my dad worked on the Shuttle program, so I have a lot of Shuttle things in storage.  Including my t-shirt from the Endeavor rollout!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my most treasured possessions is a cloth Velcro patch display panel holding all my patches from various military deployments. The official unit patches are good and all, but nothing holds a candle to the creativity of military personnel with access to a patch making shop while deployed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The little town I grew up in (Weaverville, NC) housed the factory that made all the patches for NASA missions (AB Emblem). Most of the manufacturing plants there have since closed down, but it always made me happy that my little part of Appalachia made something cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574387</guid></item><item><title>33.

For example, having that text feed on only while a button is being held down.I guesspect that because I think users would soon be fed up with an assistent that says there’s a painting on the wall or a church tower in the distance every time they turn their head.Both can be useful information, but not when you hear them for the thousandth times while in your own house/garden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42593919</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Docker has a known security issue with port exposure in that it punches holes through the firewall without asking your permission, see https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4737I usually expose ports like `127.0.0.1:1234:1234` instead of `1234:1234`. As far as I understand, it still punches holes this way but to access the container, an attacker would need to get a packet routed to the host with a spoofed IP SRC set to `127.0.0.1`. All other solutions that are better seem to be much more involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "None of the database guides I followed had warned me about the dangers of exposing a docker containerized database to the internet."This prompts a reflection about, as an industry, we should make a better job in providing solid foundations.When I check tutorials on how to drill in the wall, there is (almost) no warning about how I could lose a finger doing so. It is expected that I know I should be careful around power tools.How do we make some information part of the common sense? "Minimize the surface of exposure on the Internet" should be drilled in everyone, but we are clearly not there yet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tailscale is a great solution for this problem. I too run homeserver with Nextcloud and other stuff, but protected behind Tailscale (Wireguard) VPN. I can't even imagine exposing something like my family's personal data over internet, no matter how convenient it is.But I sympathize with OP. He is not a developer and it is sad that whatever software engineers produce is vulnerable to script kiddies. Exposing database or any server with a good password should not be exploitable in any way. C and C++ has been failing us for decades yet we continue to use such unsafe stacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601374</guid></item><item><title>37.

I did a similar project last year. Really like how your result looks with the lighting setting on.The most interesting results I got were from having multiple "variants" and giving each variant parameters for their attraction to agents of their own/other type. Implementation-wise it was a variant tag for each agent and a matrix of attraction coefficients as a uniform. Playing with the params resulted in interesting behaviors, like one variant chasing another around while they both try to avoid a third.If you're looking for an addition to this project, I'd recommend giving it a try!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super cool! I was experimenting with WebGPU and various simulations a couple months ago [1] and would love to learn more about your process!

Indirect costs in the frictions generated by complicating workflows.It all points to the need for open source ecosystems to be taken more seriously by the economically able users who most benefit from this amazing development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The still don't even have a way to avoid dependency confusion attacks when using private package repos (other than also registering every single private package name you use on pypi.org). Blows my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The one project cleared was a project containing obfuscated code, in violation of the PyPI Acceptable Use Policy.Interesting, I didn’t know that. While I haven’t released anything obfuscated on PyPI, I’ve certainly written Python projects that include obfuscated code by necessity, namely scrapers packing duktape (embedded JS interpreter) and third party obfuscated JS blobs to generate signatures and stuff. I know for a fact there are projects like that on PyPI. I wonder if those are allowed.(Come to think of it, those probably can be DMCAed if the targeted service provider is sufficiently motivated.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577938</guid></item><item><title>39.

There are a lot of barriers. It starts with our education system where people need to be in school until they are far too old until they reach the edge of the state of the art. I think it's time to rethink parts of high school and university so that people can specialize in this area sooner. Funding is another major hurdle.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Maritime Approximation" by Kevlin Henney explores the concept of approximations in software development, drawing parallels with maritime navigation. It discusses how approximations are necessary in both fields due to uncertainties and variabilities, emphasizing that perfect solutions are often unattainable. Henney highlights the importance of understanding context, using appropriate models, and being comfortable with accepting and managing imprecision in order to navigate complex problems effectively. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a pragmatic approach to approximation, encouraging software developers to adopt flexible methods that accommodate change and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

In the rest of the world, we use the metric maritime approximation,π * φ km = e nm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;historically, maritime navigation has always required much higher precision since a small error compounds into missing an island entirely. 
land-based measurements could afford to be fuzzier because you can course-correct using visible landmarks. this is also why maritime measurements standardized globally much earlier than land measurements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574600</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel 3D printing technique developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that has the potential to create biological structures through human tissues. This method, known as "bioprinting," allows for the layer-by-layer construction of complex tissue structures, which could advance regenerative medicine and the development of organ grafts. The technique aims to improve healing processes and may lead to significant improvements in transplant medicine by enabling the creation of organs tailored to individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the security vulnerabilities present in GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) and FTTH (Fiber To The Home) networks, which are commonly used for internet connectivity. It highlights how inadequate security measures, such as default passwords and lack of encryption, can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. The author emphasizes the importance of securing these networks to protect user privacy and discusses potential solutions and best practices to improve security in GPON and FTTH systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Most PON networks do not use the ONU as a method of deciding which service the user should receive. This is instead usually defined by the PPPOE session and the characteristics sent by the RADIUS server. Having zero upstream authentication beyond an ONU serial number, if that, is poor and unusual network design.If you’d like to understand more about good Ethernet based broadband network design, you should read the reference standard TR-101. This evolved from TR-099 which was the old ATM/ADSL standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/Anime4000/RTL960xThe article reminds me this Github project, which using 3rd party SFP ONU connecting internet with SLID, Model, SN and other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I shined a laser pointer through the fiber in my house, would I DOS my neighbors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599507</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Self-Unhelped," a collection of essays by author and critic Adrian Sinfield that delves into the complexities of contemporary self-help culture. It critiques the genre's tendency to oversimplify personal growth and highlights the paradoxes within self-improvement narratives. By examining cultural, psychological, and societal factors, the essays encourage readers to question the often unrealistic promises made by self-help literature. Ultimately, the collection advocates for a more nuanced understanding of self-improvement, emphasizing the importance of community and shared experiences in the journey toward personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know I think a lot of the problems is we are looking for magic when it is dull and boring around us. If all else fails, just stay at the surface and say everything is as it seems and nothing is deep or dramatic, and do nothing else but your eisenhower matrix (what’s important and urgent first, four squares on a two axis box). Because when we say nothing is magical we stop looping internally trying to find a touch of divinity when what we need is to interact with the world in a structured way to build momentum to change our environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;imo depression is a physical circumstance that selects its own downstream psychology. I don't think you can talk or reason out of depression without a radical reframing that causes your physical behavior and circumstances to change. your body and its habits create preferences for psychological intensity, which gets it hits of feelings it would get normally if the being that inhabited it were free and self accepting.the self or ego speaks language, and the therapist's demeanour is intended to create a physical peace where the self can run and exhaust itself before becoming receptive to a (hopefully constructive) reframing. where I diverge from my psychologist friends is I think using language to relieve the suffering of the being only works accidentally, or when some language can overflow the self and unseat it from its dominion of the being. there's a state of enlightened duality where you can see your thoughts without feeling them or being directed by them, much like what meditation recommends, and from that state the being literally just chooses experiencies that bring it peace or joy. sustaining that is an effort and skill that can developed with practice and exercise.trying to reconcile the symbols and artifacts of language with other symbols and artifacts of language is a treadmill to me. how's that working out? couldn't say precisely, but wisdom is shown to be right by its results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sex and the City saved me from a lifetime wasted with self-help books by one wonderful scene of some pathetic lady crying in the self-help section on the floor.  It made me realize that is pretty much every self-help reader ever.  They are never helped, they are just on a hamster wheel to the next self-help book, a little of their wallet moved from their pocket to the author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580342</guid></item><item><title>45.

It outlines various factors contributing to high data consumption by ads, including video content and tracking technologies.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe the ISP should start charging the ad network instead of the user for ad traffic. Then they can start blocking the ads of people who don't pay.The user, who pays for the service, is getting no value out of the ads and the advertiser is freeloading the ISP's technical infrastructure and userbase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising they don't mention what I imagine has to be the obvious culprit: video ads.It's not even about advertising for me -- static ads don't bother me that much. But whenever there's autoplaying video in the corner of a page, I hate it so much. Whether it's an ad, or a news site that inexplicably thinks I want to multitask and watch their news channel at the same time I read their article. It's genuinely hard to read the article when there's constant motion an inch or two away at all times!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of web pages only work for me on my iPhone if I use reader mode.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always been into vintage Mercedes-Benz cars.A talented and wonderfully jovial mechanic ran a specialist workshop east of Johannesburg, in Brakpan (South Africa).For a long time he had a Mercedes 600 - similar to the linked video but with the M100 engine naturally-aspirated as standard - in the shop.That particular car, finished in a cream colour, belonged to Ian Smith (1919-2007), the last colonial prime minister of Rhodesia before it became Zimbabwe.I got to spend a lot of time with the car, including several drives in it, and especially seeing the mechanical bits exposed including the ridiculously cool (silent, powerful) hydraulics that operated every convenience of this car, from power windows to power back seat.While a Mercedes 600 indeed screams "head of state" or "pope" it gets my vote for the all-time, no-holds-barred, most opulent and classy car of all time with absolutely nothing kitsch or gangsta about it.A true high point of what Mercedes-Benz once was.And don't get me started on it's little brother, the W109 300SEL 6.3, of which there was a lovely example in the shop for a few months as well. It drove and operated perfectly, I had the most amazing solo test drive in that car, taking it to 200km/h.This was in 2003, and the 300SEL 6.3 was for sale for $3,000 and Ian Smith's 600 was about $12,000.God if only I had the money then! I wonder where both of those rarities, sitting in a small workshop in the East Rand in South Africa, ended up at. Probably exported to Europe or the USA.Anyway, just wanted to share that small anecdote.P.S. The Chrome, Leather, and craftsmanship of a Mercedes 600 is far beyond any Rolls or Bentley, of that or any other period. And Mercedes vehicles of that era were made to last decades and hundreds of thousands of miles down to every detail including all the rubber parts. The disposable garbage churned out in the 21st century simply fuel man's insane behaviour to constantly buy, consume, discard.There was a time when cars were made for a different modality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The list of notable owner is long."Josip Broz Tito, who owned four 1965 LWB 6-door Pullmans, one of which was armoured, and two LWB Pullman landaulets, acquired in 1971 and 1978 respectively (both of these were of the very-rare type where the folding parade roof extends to cover 2/3rds of the vehicle top, only 9 were made with such a roof arrangement and 6 doors, and Tito was the only statesman in the world at the time who had two such cars)."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_600&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydraulic power windows??

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although mildly interesting, this doesn't really explore some of the more interesting dynamics of online conversation. There was a theory over in one borderline famous reddit post that most online conversations were various factions of people who were borderline mentally ill talking to each other. Boiling the situation down to a bell curve over one axis is really underselling the amount of distortion that can take place - the moderate opinion might literally not be hinted at in an online conversation.But the effect the paper hints at is real. I remember being noting with curiosity that Factorio's positive reviews vs Steam's game stats for their recent expansion and noting that the reviews must have been  done by people who probably hadn't seen the expansion's content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if researchers are simply failing to frame the problem.It might not be that the perception of norms are distorted. It's just that communities are entirely different and insulated, and thus as communities go they organically develop their own norms.This failure in perception also communicates a bias that a specific norm should be the reigning one and anything that differs from it is "distorted". This reads like last century's inherent racism in sociology, anthropology, and even linguistics, where anything that contrasted with the old country's baseline was labelled as distortions and errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the more stunning examples of Figure 1 from the paper in the wild in recent times is the discrepancy between the "consensus" on social media that the assassination of a certain healthcare CEO was justified, versus public opinion polling showing this to be a minority opinion among Americans.[0][1][0] https://stratpolitics.org/2024/12/unitedhealthcare-poll/[1] https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-pol...(The demographic breakdown in the second poll pretty starkly demonstrates as well how the sort of uneven sample of the population you typically see on places like reddit can give you a very distorted impression of public opinion.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600626</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to create a web crawler that is both polite and efficient. It emphasizes the importance of respecting website rules, such as robots.txt, to avoid overloading servers and being banned. The author outlines best practices for crawling, including managing request rates, handling retries for failed requests, and adhering to crawl delays. Additionally, it addresses the need for proper user-agent identification to inform webmasters about the crawler's presence, and it provides insights on efficiently storing and processing the retrieved data. Overall, the article serves as a guide for developing web crawlers that operate responsibly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a default max of 1 request every 5 seconds is unnecessarily meek, especially for larger sites. I'd also argue that requests that browsers don't slow down for, like following redirects to the same domain or links with the prefetch attribute, don't really necessitate a delay at all.If you can detect a site has a CDN, metrics like time-to-first-byte are low and stable and/or you're getting cache control headers indicating you're mostly getting cached pages, I see no reason why one shouldn't speed up - at least for domains with millions of URLs.I disagree with using HEAD requests for refreshing. A HEAD request is rarely cheaper and sometimes more expensive for some websites than a GET If-Modified-Since/If-None-Match. Besides, you're going to fetch the page anyway if it changed, so why issue two requests when you could do one?Having a single crawler per process/thread makes rate limiting easier, but it can lead to some balancing and under-utilization issues with distributed crawling due to the massive variation in URLs per domain and site speeds, especially if you use something like a hash to distribute them. For Commoncrawl, I had something that monitored utilization and  shut down crawler instances which would redistribute URLs pending from the machines shutting down to the machines left (we were doing it on a shoestring budget using AWS spot instances, so it had to survive instances going down randomly anyway).I'd say one of the best polite things to do when crawling is to add a URL to the crawler user agent pointing to a page explaining what it is and maybe letting people opt-out or explain how to update their robots.txt to let them out-out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've done crawling at a small startup and I've done crawling at a big tech company. This is not crawling more politely than big tech.There are a few things that stand out, like:&gt;  I fetch all robots.txts for given URLs in parallel inside the queue's enqueue function.Could this end up DOS'ing or being "impolite" just in robots.txt requests?All of this logic is per-domain, but nothing mentioned about what constitutes a domain. If this is naive, it could easily end up overloading a server that uses wildcard subdomains to serve its content, like Substack having each blog on a separate subdomain.When I was at a small startup doing crawling, the main thing our partners wanted from us was a maximum hit rate (varied by partner). We typically promised fewer than 1 request per second, which would never cause perceptible load, and was usually sufficient for our use-case.Here at $BigTech, the systems for ensuring "polite", and policy-compliant crawling (robots.txt etc) are more extensive than I could possibly have imagined before coming here.It doesn't surprise me that OpenAI and Amazon don't have great systems for this, both are new to the crawling world, but concluding that "Big Tech" doesn't do polite crawling is a bit of a stretch, given that search engines are most likely doing the best crawling available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have cache headers, why use HEAD? Are servers more likely to handle HEAD correctly than including them on the GET?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570010</guid></item><item><title>50.

He was the one that kept the Anchor flywheel at unsustainably high APR, moved more UST to refill the reserves and so on. He also ignored warnings of a death spiral and continued with advertising unrealistic expectations.When the depeg happened, Do Kwon was front and center on making it sound like everything was under control, instead of damage control. And his creation of LUNA2 is even more of a joke for the people that lost money on this.Is it his fault that it collapsed? Maybe not directly, but he steered the boat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The figure "$40B" is bandied about uncritically in the press, but I gather this is the highest notional market cap of Terra/Luna, not a reflection of actual money (fiat) put in?By contrast, SBF of FTX fame was convicted of stealing $8.7B and ordered to restitute the amount to investors in USD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the SEC going to do with the $4.55B settlement?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42598604</guid></item><item><title>1.

As far as I can tell, it's fully custom-made for this game? Can't find any references to the characters online.https://stimulation-clicker.neal.fun/ sounds/true-crime.mp3 - it's hosted on Cloudflare, but even so I don't want to cost OP significant bandwidth, so join the two strings above for the direct link."Aww, he was all cat 'n tonic when he first saw her." An absolute classic. I would do anything to know more about how this came to exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I finished the game without cheating. I felt like a frog being slowly boiled (and it really does feel like you're boiling at the end). It's quite the journey...I love how everything here isn't even farfetched. It's just standard YouTube and TikTok content. The red notification bubbles were also a nice touch, I felt myself really drawn to those, and if I think back, I guess that's the earliest example I can recall of where these patterns all started: Facebook's little red notification bubble&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, that was amazing. This is honestly a better piece of contemporary art (in terms of making you think about modern life and what is happening to our environment, the impact on ourselves, our kids, etc.) than most of what you might see at a fancy art gallery or a contemporary art museum in NYC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611536</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Doom: The Gallery Experience is an interactive virtual reality project that immerses players in a unique experience inspired by the classic game "Doom." This project creatively combines elements of exploration and art, allowing players to navigate through vibrant and abstract environments while engaging in gameplay reminiscent of the original Doom style. The experience emphasizes visually striking graphics and atmospheric sound design, aiming to transport players into a reimagined world that pays homage to the iconic game while providing a fresh perspective in the form of an artistic gallery setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advancements in neural architecture search (NAS) methods, particularly focusing on a novel approach called the "Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Adaptivity" (ENAS-AD). It emphasizes the importance of adaptivity in optimizing the search process for neural network architectures, enhancing both performance and efficiency. The research presents theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations demonstrating how ENAS-AD can significantly reduce the search space and time required to identify high-performing architectures, thereby contributing to the broader field of automated machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Didn’t see it mentioned but good to know about: UCR matrix profile.The Matrix Profile is honestly one of the most underrated tools in the time series analysis space - it's ridiculously efficient. The killer feature is how it just works for finding motifs and anomalies without having to mess around with window sizes and thresholds like you do with traditional techniques. Solid across domains too, from manufacturing sensor data to ECG analysis to earthquake detection.https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use offset function in Prometheus to make an average of past weeks as a recording rule. We have a use in our systems that is very "seasonal" as in weekly cycles so I make an average of some metric (offset 1 week, 2 week, 3 week , 4 week/4) and I compare it to the current value of that metric. That way the alarms can be set day or night, weekday or weekend, and the thresholds are dynamic. It compares against an average of the day of the week, or time of the day.
There is someone in Gitlab that posted a more in depth explanation of this way of working.

[1]An aha moment for me was realizing that the way you can think of anomaly models working is that they’re effectively forecasting the next N steps, and then noticing when the actual measured values are “different enough” from the expected. This is simple to draw on a whiteboard for one signal but when it’s multi variate, pretty neat that it works.[1] https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609595</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The essay on htmx.org discusses the future of web development, highlighting the potential of htmx to enhance user experiences by enabling rich, dynamic interactions without heavy reliance on JavaScript frameworks. It argues for a simpler, more efficient approach to building web applications, focusing on server-driven UIs that leverage HTML and facilitate rapid development. The piece emphasizes the importance of progressive enhancement, maintainability, and the role of developers in shaping the web's future by reassessing their tools and methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve just completed a port from HTMX to Hotwire (Stimulus, Turbo). HTMX is a great idea, but in my experience it’s a poor execution.It’s really quite buggy, in my experience it plays poorly with fundamental web and browser features (relative links are broken in at least 2 ways, I fixed a third way). One of the events just stopped working at all in the most recent release. The docs are lacking. And where it promises to let you write less JS, if you ever do need to write some JS you’re on your own in structuring that, and you’ll be fighting against HTMX (who gets to update the DOM, maintaining event handlers, etc).As a (brief) contributor to HTMX, I also feel like these issues were all inevitable. It’s a single 5k line file with 190 top level functions in it meaning it’s pretty impenetrable to get up to speed on. When proposing a bug fix the maintainers weren’t sure if it would have other consequences. Tests didn’t cover the functionality. I’ve been mostly a backend engineer in my career, and I empathise with not wanting the complexity of a modern frontend, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have some basic organisation of the code to make it approachable and more obvious whether changes will work or not.After porting to Turbo and Stimulus I have a more reliable code base, I have significantly less JavaScript, and I have a JS code base that much easier to reason about. I really wanted to like HTMX but the execution is not there. A focus on stability is a great fit for the project, but it’s most certainly not there yet and has quite a way to go in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ...you can use as much or as little of it as you like... Stability as a Feature... No New Features as a Feature...This is the way.Having lived the alternative, I won't consider building anything significant on top of an abstraction that doesn't credibly promise these.When the abstraction you've built on changes or fails, the thing you built breaks. When you choose an unstable abstraction, you're creating future bugs you'll have to spend future time on to resolve (and if it wraps the lower layer rather than sitting beside it, you have fewer options to fix them).These aren't concerns for things that will be short-lived, or are small enough to replace if needed. But I've seen plenty of small and temporary things turn into large and permanent things when they end up being useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've created a Django application using HTMX. Usually I'd jump to React or Vue. It was a great exercise and I can see where HTMX would be a great fit.1. If you consider yourself a "backend developer" only and want to write the minimum amount of JS/TS.2. If your application is simple. Yes you can do more complicated interactivity with oob swaps, but you end up with more complexity than you chose HTMX for.For my next projects, I will still use Django but with React/Vue for pieces that need interactivity. As an example in my HTMX app, I wanted to add a profile image uploader. Lots of great frontend libraries exist to resize / modify your image before even uploading it to your server.Finally, HTMX is just not testable the same way modern frontend libraries are. I've managed to write some decent tests using beautifulsoup, but it's night and day compared to vitest or jest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613221</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses kakizome, the traditional Japanese practice of writing the first calligraphy of the year, typically performed on January 2nd. It highlights the significance of this ritual in Japanese culture, symbolizing new beginnings and the setting of intentions or resolutions for the year ahead. The piece includes tips on how to prepare for kakizome, such as selecting appropriate materials and themes for the calligraphy, and emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and expression in the art form.&lt;/p&gt;

Its a small ritual performed by ancient Chinese intellectuals on the first day of the New Year. It has a history of about 1,000 years. During the Qing Dynasty, the emperor's ceremony became more grand and lengthy, including writing words of blessing with ornate Chinese brushes, symbolically turning the pages of the New Year's calendar (in the early Qing Dynasty, European missionaries participated in the improvement of the traditional Chinese calendar) [2] and drinking from a golden cup symbolizing the eternal and unbreakable borders. Ironically, one of the golden cups was stolen by French invaders during the Second Opium War [3].[1] https://imagepphcloud.thepaper.cn/pph/image/114/965/140.jpg

[3] https://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMP/eMuseumPlus?se...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Few more fun facts:Elementary school students all write kakizome at the end of December. Within the school, each grade will write the exact same thing. They're hung in the halls for all to see. Hundreds of the exact same kakizome.Many people burn their kakizome mid-January during "Dondoyaki."The posture, attention and care taken while writing Kakizome is one of the important points. Those, and the outcome of the characters themselves, are all taken into account.Unrelated, but Japan's officaily chosen Kanji for the year 2024 was "金" which means gold, or money, or heck, even Friday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last year even though I didn’t have a theme, I made small changes in the way I live, tried to complete my 15 book goodreads challenge, started doing sports and improve myself professionally on my free time.This year started with pretty fundamental questions in the way I live and uncertainties about my future so deciding on a theme is very difficult. I can’t answer those questions and don’t know what I really want. I will try to put an effort into keeping the good habits I gained last year though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42576436</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to use io_uring, but as long as it bypasses seccomp it should be disabled whenever seccomp is in use. As such, I use epoll, and find it annoying when kernel APIs like ublk require io_uring. The places I'd want to use ublk are inside sandboxes using seccomp. Given that container runtimes, hardened kernels, chromeos, etc., disable io_uring, using it means needing an epoll fallback anyways, so might as well just use epoll and not maintain two async backends for your application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But they were all of them deceived?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This document helped me learn the io_uring API.You can use io_uring with epoll to monitor eventfd to wake up your sleeping with io_uring wait for completions.I have implemented a barrier and thread safe techniques that I am trying to turn into a command line toolMy goal is that thread safe performant servers are easy to write.I am using bloom filters for fast set intersection. I intend to use Simd instructions with the bloom hashes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608436</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Professional coin &amp; currency nerd here)Fun fact about these — when the treasury first issued these, many people decided to cut them into odd off-center pieces and sell the resulting notes as miscut errors.Once that started happening, the treasury (BEP to be specific) very quickly changed the serial numbers so they’re all very recognizable as having come from an uncut sheet. I didn’t check the latest for all denominations, but I know for $1 bills they all start with 99.So if you see a “miscut dollar error” for sale on eBay or the like, always check the serial. If it starts with 99 then it’s just someone who had some fun with a pair of scissors and it’s not a real error.For example, to wit:https://www.ebay.com/itm/135364285098&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Wozniak (the Apple cofounder) famously bought sheets of $2 bills, and had a printer perforate and gum them into pads.So he could literally tear off $2 bills, in front of people who might not even know it was real currency, to pay them.https://web.archive.org/web/20180311084811/http://archive.wo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the US one of the few countries that can't keep a consistent design across their bills and still does not have a way for blind people to identify which note they have.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best sales people I've worked with were incredible strategic thinkers and not really sales people at all.They built an intimate knowledge of their customer and their industry, built strong connections with the top brass of their client by delivering exceptional work that got those people promoted, and were really good at building autonomous teams that could get the (exceptional) work done with their guidance on the customer/industry/client. These folks would also often deliver very difficult messages to their clients, which often resulted in more business not less.The sleazy sales people can build decent pipelines/sales numbers but they are not what I would ever label as 'elite'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real secret to having a successful sales career is to work at a company that sells a market leading product. This trumps 99% of anything you can do as an individual.I have seen complete noobs have good sales careers at AWS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The better you are at selling, the more debased your life becomes, as everything is reduced to a transaction, a leveraging of the smallest edgeI think that's the essence of having a sales mindset if I had to explain it. It's really hard to convey what it means and I think only those that worked close with people with this talent would have a chance to know what this really means. Sales is an art on top of a very technical game, where you have an unlimited number of secret knobs to balance. It's like seeing chefs or f1 drivers performing at their best, and as such it's not just about grit, you also need talent on top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602330</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the distinction between achieving Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and effectively fulfilling one’s job responsibilities. The author argues that while hitting OKRs is important for organizational success, it should not come at the expense of the core functions and values of a job. The piece emphasizes the need for balancing goal achievement with genuine work quality, encouraging teams to focus on both effective execution and fulfilling their roles meaningfully. The author also highlights the pitfalls of an overly rigid adherence to OKRs that can lead to compromising on the true intent of one's work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now having worked in a few smaller teams since my time at FB, I realize how marvellous it is to not have to worry about OKRs, performance reviews and all that malarkey. It was so draining to run yourself as a mini PR/brand within one's team (/one's department) and market oneself (one's team) to your manager (/your company).So much mental bandwidth was spent.I also, from a systems-thinking POV, just fundamentally reject the value in OKRs as a meaningful proxy for the value you (/your team) are producing unless you are an entirely mechanistic function. By mechanistic I mean you have a clear discrete Input&lt;&gt;Output expectation. Every single time an element of human activity is reduced to a metric, you lose something, and if you do it enough times, you've effectively produced a metric that is completely distinct from the thing you intended on measuring in the first place. For example: let's say you're in the suicide prevention team at FB, and your OKR is 'number of suicides averted'. Well, that sounds good, but unbeknownst to you, perverse incentives have kicked in and invisibly imbued your metric-chasing experiments a dark undertone. A new risk model might start flagging more content as potentially suicidal to boost numbers, leading to over-intervention that could traumatize users or waste resources. Or perhaps the surface we use to measure success, a UX or user activity metric, might actually be uncorrelated with crisis aversion or... and this is where it hits: the thing that's instrumental in crises is social media itself. The metric becomes a game, and it games _you_. Your team thinks you're doing X, but you're really doing Y. Because you're disattached from the real problem and comforted by incredibly lossy proxies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading an anecdote about this stuff from the book The Essential Deming by W. Edwards Deming the "father of the quality movement and was hugely influential in post-WWII Japan".It talked about some company moving oil around in barges, the setup was unprofitable and a new manager was brought up to fix it. He created metrics of the business, but didn't put any goals or goalposts for the barge crews and other managers in the company.All he did was simply print the metrics and glue them on every barge of the fleet weekly. Soon the whole project was massively profitable. Apparently the captains of the barges would compete with each other to see who could save more money, without any penalties for the low performing nor any rewards for the high performing barges.One thing that was very surprising is that the barges were given freedom to choose where to source materials and, more importantly, the fuel. Before the metrics the captains would pick whatever was closest no matter the prices, after the metrics the captains would, on their own, try to source fuel from the cheapest place that they could. No amount of central planning could have been as optimal as the prices fluctuated a lot from day to day, so whenever a captain saw a good deal he would re-fuel.It turns out that empowered people want to do a good job and want to save money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reality of OKRs (or Rockefeller Habits or any other company wide framework for establishing priorities and goals,) is that by going through the exercise of trying to create them across the company, you often discover that there are meaningful disconnects in how teams are prioritizing work or how teams function vs how other stakeholders in the company believe those teams are operating. The real value comes from diving deeper into understanding those things. However, companies often view those as annoyances and find a way to plow the goals through while completely missing that learning opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607623</guid></item><item><title>10.

It highlights the evolution of the site, the motivations behind the relaunch, and the changes in fan culture over the years. The author shares insights on nostalgia, the impact of the internet on fandom, and the challenges of maintaining relevance in a digital landscape. The piece also emphasizes the importance of community and personal connection within the fan base.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somehow, the (much less impressive) Star Trek fan site I created in 2000 when I was 13 is still online.I’ve long since lost access to it but the freeservers mob I hosted it with have somehow kept the sites from way back then all around and online still to this day. It’s a little painful and factually incorrect (I called the movie Generations a series!) but gives me a good laugh:
http://stvoyager.iwarp.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first website I ever built, where I learned HTML, was a Goldeneye 007 N64 fan site. I had all the cheats, all the walkthroughs, all the funny jokes and animated gifs. I misspelled "license to kill" in the url I created at angelfire.Angelfire has a lot of sites from back then (~1999?), but not mine.The site wasn't even that bad by modern standards. Had a frames layout, vertical frame on the left for the nav. I didn't know about server side includes yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I rehosted my Tolkien fanpage from 1999 or so: https://tolkien.stavros.ioI also have my personal website from back then somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42605707</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the "squandered holy grail" in relation to opportunities that are often overlooked or wasted due to indecision, inaction, or underestimating their potential. It explores how individuals and organizations frequently fail to recognize and capitalize on valuable chances, leading to regret and missed growth. The piece emphasizes the importance of decisiveness, proactive behavior, and the willingness to embrace risks to fully harness these opportunities and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it is concerning that every single Apple Intelligence feature they've shipped thus far has been not just mediocre; but bad. Being last to the party is a very normal Apple thing; quality and Doing The Right Thing takes time. Announcing something then taking months to ship it is very not-Apple, but it has happened a few times. That thing they finally ship being bad is, geeze, horribly un-Apple.One of the few examples I can think of however is Apple Maps. And it did get better; a lot better, some say better than Google Maps nowadays. So I generally do have hope for Apple Intelligence. At the end of the day, there are some disparate competing utilities in this class on the Samsung and Google phones, but no one is shipping something that is obviously game-changing and in first place; they all kinda suck, they're all tech demos, and it'll inevitably take many years to get this technology honed in to something that is truly useful to consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "bicycle for the mind" goal, and the Steve Jobs quote that inspired it, is really just another restatement of McLuhan's idea of media as being extensions of man. The bicycle (or wheel, more generally) is an extension of the legs, a phone is an extension of your voice, etc.The problem with interpreting AI through that lens is that AI, as it is being used here, is not an extension of your mind. Plenty of other things are (organizers for example), but AI does not extend your thoughts. It replaces them. Its notification summary feature does not improve your ability to quickly digest lots of notification information, it replaces it with its own attempt, which, not being your own judgment, can and does easily err.There are some uses of AI that do act more like a McLuhanesque medium. Some copilot applications, in which suggestions are presented that a user accepts and refines them, are examples of this. But a lot of the uses of both image generation and LLM tools serve to limit what your mind does rather than expand it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They failed IMO as soon as they started marketing this stuff as AI. Nobody _actually_ cares about that. They just want new and exciting device capabilities. The fact that they haven’t done anything compelling enough to detach it from the AI moniker means they don’t have anything. Yet. The overall foundation is sound. Maybe in a generation or two we will have a truly compelling use case. Part of me doubts it, though, because Apple isn’t the company they used to be when it comes to innovating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607151</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;DeepFace is an open-source Python library designed for facial recognition and facial attribute analysis. It simplifies the process of implementing state-of-the-art facial recognition models and provides easy access to multiple pre-trained models for tasks like face verification, face recognition, and emotion detection. The library is built on TensorFlow and Keras, and it supports various backends for improved accuracy and performance. Additionally, DeepFace includes functionalities for aligning faces, making it user-friendly for developers and researchers looking to integrate facial analysis in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this package. has a bunch of functions for most face recognition, detection and feature extraction purposes. love the readme.md docs for familiarizing with the basic features. PLUS it offers different models(backends) for the tasks which lets you try out a bunch of approach for the same task without writing a custom function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The performance is focused on correctness and the APIs work with individual images. The underlying models can be run with batches, but you need to extract the architecture code to run directly. As a result, while I started with DeepFace, I mostly just used the models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious whether others here are working with supervised dimensionality reduction for face embeddings, particularly using single-task or multi-task learning approaches.While clustering tends to perform better after dimensionality reduction, selecting the optimal dimensions depends heavily on your specific use case. This makes it more complex than simply applying PCA or t-SNE.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584896</guid></item><item><title>13.

Over the years I moved to Noda-RED for this kind of thing, but Pipes was just so much easier to use for quick queries and filtering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My biggest use for Yahoo Pipes was filtering podcast feeds - namely, filtering out episodes I don't care about. For instance, a podcast I listen to has episodes where they just talk shop and others where they play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I really cannot be bothered to care about the latter type.I actually wrote a little, easily modifiable Digital Ocean function I've been
customizing and deploying per feed I want to filter. It feels like a hack, and it is, but it's "good enough". It's been working reasonably well and runs rarely enough that it falls into Digital Ocean’s free tier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609819</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article on spline fields elaborates on a technique in computer graphics used for creating smooth curves and surfaces. It explains the principles behind spline interpolation and the various types of splines, such as Bézier and B-splines, highlighting their applications in modeling and animation. Additionally, it discusses the advantages of using spline fields in terms of flexibility and control over shape design, along with practical examples and illustrations that demonstrate how these concepts are implemented in different scenarios. Overall, the piece serves as an informative resource for understanding and applying spline fields in digital design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me when i worked on an open world game ~12 years ago. I implemented spline-based "stripes" (think long decals), mainly to be used for roads (though could also be used for smaller things like blood trails) and i added a button in the editor to align the terrain with the stripe with a configurable falloff so that it transitions smoothly from the stripe to the surrounding terrain - and optionally you could use a (grayscale) texture to modulate the falloff so that the transition isn't completely smooth.Next thing i knew, the environment artists had started using stripes to sculpt the terrain :-P&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s nice to see some real-world graphics programming in a visual language.Node-based environments can be powerful for exploring solutions like this, but they don’t often make it to Hacker News.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The surfels and isolines examples were great, reminded me of reticulating splines!

Hello! This was a false positive in our systems at
@ChainPatrol
. We are retracting the takedown request, and will conduct a full post-mortem to ensure this does not happen again.We have been combatting a huge volume of fake YouTube videos that are attempting to steal user funds. Unfortunately, in our mission to protect users from scams, false positives (very) occasionally slip through.We are actively working to reduce how often this happens, because it's never our intent to flag legitimate videos. We're very sorry about this! Will keep you posted on the takedown retraction.
"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a good baseline might be that you need to deposit say $1M and then when oops, you accidentally made a bogus claim it's OK that $1M is split between the victim of your oopsy and Youtube for their trouble - you just pay $1M to get back into the game. Outfits like this could explain to their investors that while their technology does sometimes have little goofs that cost a few billion dollars per year, once they invent perfect AI they can scale infinitely and make that back easily, so if you invest $10Bn of your fiat currency today, in 18 months they can 100% guarantee nothing in particular, wow.This works for actual creators, who are occasionally slightly inconvenienced but handsomely rewarded when that occurs, for Youtube, who get paid each time these "rare" mistakes happen, and for the companies "innovating" by making up nonsense and taking people's money. Just as well the "investment" goes to a Youtuber as to some random office park or an ad firm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a friendly heads up. Anyone who wants to avoid Twitter, since it has become so toxic, can use the domain xcancel.com in place of twitter.com or x.com. like so:https://xcancel.com/3blue1brown/status/1876291319955398799This links to independent Nitter to provide a full thread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612494</guid></item><item><title>16.

Sometimes you just need that control.For example in my case, I would get app support emails all day and night, and even if I had DND enabled, I would wake to 3-6 emails that accumulated over night and my mornings would get hectic instantly. I would forget to eat for a long time and my mood would be irritable all day.I had to place my own small API in front of Formspark to delay the emails for specific times of the day to avoid this. Something like FormBee would allow me to alter this in the server code directly instead of building yet another API.[1] https://lowtechguys.com/contact[2] https://lunar.fyi/contact[3] https://alinpanaitiu.com/contact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose the easiest way to use this or similar and be compliant with Hipaa would be to send the data vai webhook to a Hipaa compliant thing..I've been looking for self hostable:
 encryption before emailing and 
encryption at rest for form submissions dat saved in a server DB eg sql with wordpress moved to something else,anyone having suggestions (things free or under $29 / mth) I'm all ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have really easily implemented this service with Nocodb.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big bag of rice, and big bag of dry beans.  Or cheap canned beans, if you're not up to cooking beans properly (I wasn't).A working-poor friend also used to buy steel-cut oats, to eat breakfast for pennies.If you buy fresh vegetables, learn how to keep them from spoiling on you.With canned soup, instant ramen, and a lot of other packaged foods, pay attention to the sodium.  (I avoid a lot of those, or end up diluting it, or, say, using only half the seasoning packet.)Where you shop matters to budget.  Where I live, WFM has bought out, or driven out, most of the other grocery stores (and one of the remaining stores prices similarly, but without the cachet), but a Market Basket is just a short hike over the train tracks.For specialty groceries, a small grocery store serving some ethnic group for which that's a staple, can be cheaper than most broader grocery stores.Don't get scurvy, or other nutritional deficiency.  If you can't make sure all your nutrients are covered, I've guessed (I'm not a nutritionist) that a mainstream multivitamin pill can't hurt.You should also count your calories, to make sure you're getting enough.  Once you start being more penny-pinching with eating, you might find yourself getting hungry less, rather than more, and it's not hard to slip into caloric deficit that will make you sick.  There are calculators on the Web for how much you should intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind this is a dangerous route to go down long term.Optimising for economic cost with the only requirement being "fill your belly" and "be palatable enough", tends to result in poor nutrition. This is roughly how the industry optimises food - minimise economic cost, maximise yield, and maximise sales (make everything artificially hyper palatable), with terrible results.In the long term this is partly covered by the economic cost on a personal basis because of the cost in health care and loss of ability to produce income due to deteriorating health. But this is displaced in time, and you do not want to do this experiment on yourself, it's not reversible.Calories are not equal, as a general rule, buying cheap food often means cheaping out on nutritional value. If you want to frame it in terms of money, buying good quality food now is an investment in your future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised at how few calories per day this wasFor day 11/2 can Campbell's Tomato Soup - 135
Milk, half of 10.7 floz - 133.75
4 slices white bread - 600
Tillamook Italian 3-Cheese, 58 g - 186.43
Butter, 32 g - 228.57
Homemade Kimchi (73 g) - 25.75135 + 133.75 + 600 + 186.43 + 228.57 + 25.75 = 1,309.5 calories which is generally well under weight maintenance levels for anyone moderately active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606773</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on the concept of a triptych, a three-part artwork often used in religious contexts. It explores its historical significance, artistic techniques, and the emotional and thematic depth achieved through the triptych format. The author discusses various examples of famous triptychs, their arrangement, and how they engage viewers through interconnected narratives and symbolism. The piece emphasizes the triptych's ability to convey complex stories and experiences, making it a powerful form of expression in art.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Co-author here! I'll let the proposal mostly speak for itself but one recurring question it doesn't answer is: "how likely is any of this to happen?"My answer is: I'm pretty optimistic! The people on WHATWG have been responsive and offered great feedback. These things take a long time but we're making steady progress so far, and the webpage linked here will have all the status updates. So, stay tuned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the meanwhile, I found that enabling page transitions is a progressive enhancement tweak that can go a long way in making HTML replacement unnecessary in a lot of cases.1) Add this to your css:    @view-transition { navigation: auto; }

2) Profit.Well, not so fast haha. There are a few details that you should know [1].* Firefox has not implemented this yet but it seems likey they are working on it.* All your static assets need to be properly cached to make the best use of the browser cache.Also, prefetching some links on hover, like those on a navbar, is helpful.Add a css class "prefetch" to the links you want to prefetch, then use something like this:    document.addEventListener("mouseover", ({target}) =&gt; {
      if (target.tagName !== "A" || !target.classList.contains("prefetch")) return;
      target.classList.remove("prefetch");

      const linkElement = document.createElement("link");
      linkElement.rel = "prefetch";
      linkElement.href = target.getAttribute("href");
      document.head.appendChild(linkElement);
    })

There's more work on prefetching/prerendering going on but it is a lil green (experimental) at the moment [2].--1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@view-trans...2: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was reading “The future of htmx” blog post which is also being discussed on HN [1], the “htmx is the new jQuery” idea jumped out at me. Given that jQuery has been gradually replaced by native JavaScript [2], I wondered what web development could look like if htmx is gradually replaced by native HTML.Triptych could be it, and it’s particularly interesting that it’s being championed by the htmx developers.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613221[2]: https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42615646</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the regulatory developments surrounding the implementation of Wi-Fi in the 6 GHz band, highlighting the benefits of expanded bandwidth for faster and more efficient wireless communication. It emphasizes the efforts of the Wi-Fi Alliance and various regulatory bodies to enable 6 GHz Wi-Fi globally, outlining the improved performance, reduced interference, and increased capacity that this new spectrum offers. Additionally, it covers the ongoing global initiatives and successes in securing spectrum allocations for Wi-Fi use in the 6 GHz range, aiming to enhance user experiences in wireless connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like there is a “fight” with telecom guys trying to license 6GHz for 5G and others fighting for it to be unlicensed.Interesting to see that countries are tilting towards unlicensing even with strong lobbying of telecoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's always amazing to me how reluctant everyone is to grant ISM bandwidth.  If you watch a spectrum analyzer you'll immediately notice that the ISM bands are packed and licensed space is entirely empty.  At this point with devices being both much more dynamic and much more spatially multiplexed (and more directional) I have a hard time accepting arguments that really anything from DC to daylight should be licensed at this point outside of a few very small niches (GPS and airband mostly).  We should be gradually deprecating equipment that requires absolute band exclusion to operate because just slicing up spectrum is by far the least efficient way of utilizing a finite resource.It's also worth pointing out that we're about to lose about half of one of our ISM bands (915MHz, LoRa, Meshtastic, ELRS, various smart home protocols etc) due to the lovely folks at NextNav wanting dedicated bandwidth for a paywalled GPS alternative.  It's by far the best ISM band in the US for long range unlicensed communications due to being in a sweet spot of path loss, penetration, and bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606484</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "All Clocks Are 30 Seconds Late" by Victor Poughon explores the concept of time perception and its implications in daily life. It discusses how our understanding of time is influenced by various factors such as culture, technology, and personal experiences. Poughon reflects on the psychological and philosophical aspects of time, emphasizing that our clocks, while precise, often do not align with our lived experiences. The piece invites readers to reconsider their relationship with time and how it shapes their reality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All universal statements like this are wrong and stem from basic ignorance&gt; So when it's actually 14:15:45, they'll show 14:15. And when the actual time goes from 14:15:59 to 14:16:00, then that's when your clock changes from 14:15 to 14:16.No, that's a silly mistake, look at the picture (though much better - video) of the analogue clock to see it's not the case, the minutes hand moves continuously, so isn't at 15 at 15:59&gt; the meeting is in 5 minutes.That's not the only question we ask about time. Has the meeting/game already started? You can't answer that with an average value&gt; for some context appropriate reason) you reply with just hours, you would say it's 11!No, you reply would depend on the context, which you haven't specified.&gt; Please someone tell me I'm not crazyOf course not, just trying to replace one ambiguity with another. Maybe instead come up with a more precise minutes display in digital clocks that adds more info like two dots flashing when it's past 30 sec and only 1 dot when it's before? (In phones you could use color or a few more pixels within all the padding?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flooring makes more sense in every case, from years to milliseconds and more. A few reasons:You want to send a message at exactly 13:00:00, you have a digital clock that doesn't show seconds. What you do is that you watch your clock, and as soon as it goes from 12:59 to 13:00, you press the button. That's also how you set the time precisely by hand. With rounding, that would be 12:59:30, who wants to send a message at precisely 12:59:30 ?You have a meeting at 13:00:00, you watch the clock to see if you are early or late. With flooring, if you see 13:00, you know you are late. With rounding, you are not sure.It is common for digital clocks to have big numbers for hours and minutes and small numbers for seconds. If you are not interested in seconds, you can look quickly from afar and you have your usual, floored time. If you want to be precise, you look closer and get your seconds. Rounding the minutes would be wrong, because it wouldn't match the time with seconds. And you don't want clocks with a small display for seconds you may not even see to show a different time than those that don't.And if you just want to know the approximate time and don't care about being precise to the second, then rounding up or down doesn't really matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I apologise for my "but, actually...":Analogue clocks like the face of big ben are not like digital displays, and whether they "show seconds" in the context of the meaning of this article is not, like digital displays, down to whether there is a dedicated hand.Unlike digital displays, the largest denomination hand on an analogue clock display contains all of the information that the smaller hands do (depending on the movement in some cases).The easiest way to realise this is to imagine a clock without the minute hand. Can you tell when it's half-past the hour? You can. The hour hand is half way between the two hours.Again, it depends on the movement, but it is not out of the question that your minute hand is moving once every second, and not every minute. It is down to the number of beats per unit time for an analogue display as to what the minimum display resolution is (regardless of if the movement is analogue or digital itself).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612842</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and progression of structural code editors, highlighting how these tools have evolved to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy. It explores the features and functionalities that have emerged over time, such as improved user interfaces, integration with other development tools, and support for collaborative coding. The evolution is framed in the context of changing programming practices and the increasing complexity of codebases, emphasizing the importance of structural code editors in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the way. Programs are not text, there's an impedance mismatch that shows at the seams.There're good reasons it hasn't been done more: text is good for troubleshooting, "every program should do one thing well" and maybe preventing lock-in.But with programming tools reaching maturity, we'll see more of this. Also there's an AI-related aspect: bots can understand structure just fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m obsessed with structural editors because it feels intuitively like the right approach to creating software. However I’ve yet to come across an interface that really clicks. Still love it though. Right now I’m building a structured editor for creating UIs, so can attest to how difficult it is to get it right.It’s a super interesting problem space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoy Lisp and Lisp-alike languages specifically because with the right editor support you can do a lot of this kind of structural editing stuff without giving up the niceties of source code as text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608923</guid></item><item><title>26. 42 - Spacecraft Simulation</title><link>https://github.com/ericstoneking/42</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The website "Killed by LLM" discusses the challenges and failures associated with large language models (LLMs), particularly their limitations in understanding context and providing accurate responses. It presents various examples where LLMs generated incorrect or nonsensical output, highlighting the potential consequences of relying heavily on these technologies in critical applications. The site serves as a critique of the overestimation of LLM capabilities, urging caution and critical thinking when integrating them into real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO a critical feature of the Turing test/imitation game, which many modern implementations including this site's linked paper ignore, is that the interrogator talks to both a human and a bot and must decide that one xor the other is a human. So fooling an interrogator means having them choose the bot as human over an actual human, not just judging the bot to be human (while probably judging humans to be human even more frequently).When the interrogator is only answering "do you think your conversation partner was a human?" individually, bots can score fairly highly simply by giving little information in either direction - like pretending to be a non-english-speaking child, or sending very few messages.Whereas when pitted against a human, the bot is forced to give stronger or equally strong evidence of being human as the average human (over enough tests). To be chosen as human, giving 0 evidence becomes a bad strategy when the opponent (the real human) is likely giving some positive non-zero evidence towards their personhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posted by Chollet himself:&gt; I don't think people really appreciate how simple ARC-AGI-1 was, and what solving it really means.
It was designed as the simplest, most basic assessment of fluid intelligence possible. Failure to pass signifies a near-total inability to adapt or problem-solve in unfamiliar situations.&gt; Passing it means your system exhibits non-zero fluid intelligence -- you're finally looking at something that isn't pure memorized skill.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Simple Defer," a lightweight tool designed to simplify the asynchronous loading of JavaScript in web development. It allows developers to easily defer the execution of script tags, improving page load performance and enhancing user experience. The tool is ready-to-use and provides clear instructions for implementation, making it accessible for those looking to optimize their web pages without extensive coding knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once worked on a student robotics project where if you didn't gracefully shut down the connection to a specialized camera, it had a significant chance of physically bricking the camera.We were using C++ and essentially instrumented code review processes, despite being a student group, to ensure nothing was ever called in a way where the destructor wouldn't be called - and broke out vision processing into a separate process so if other processes crashed we'd still be okay. In retrospect it was amazing training for a software engineering career.But I always look at the words "simple" and "defer" and shudder when I see them next to each other!Just like you'd have a "threat model" for cybersecurity, make sure you understand the consequences of a defer/destructor implementation not functioning properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The C++ lambda version can be a foot gun: https://godbolt.org/z/Wd66GcrdG, if the return value is a struct, NRVO (named return value optimization) may be applied and the lambda will be called in different order.As for the n3434 proposal, given that the listed implementation experiences are all macro-based, wouldn't it be more easily adopted if proposed as a standard macro like &lt;stdarg.h&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think "you can implement this slightly modified version of the proposal in GCC macros" is a good reason to change the defer proposal. It doesn't work in clang¹ or any other non-GCC C implementation, a trailing semicolon after the close brace is an ugly wart, and saying "if you want to implement this all you have to do is implement [[gnu::cleanup]] and nested local functions" is presumably much more work for other C implementations than just implementing defer is. I also question whether this even works in GCC with executable stacks disabled (I know GCC can optimize away the trampoline since the function doesn't escape the local scope, but does GCC let you write nested functions at all without executable stacks?).¹The author says it works in clang using Apple's Blocks feature, but Blocks should not be required for defer and the variable semantics are wrong so it's a non-starter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613671</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This happens to me, a lot. I now consider it part of my workflow.I submit something for testing.It gets ignored by everyone else.I keep testing like mad, fixing even the smallest "niggles" that I can find, re-releasing, and, each time, asking for input.Which I seldom get.In the end, I say "Fuck it. Let's ship." but I don't do that, until I'm really sure that there's no more bugs to be found (spoiler: There's always more bugs to be found, and they pop up, immediately after I release).I'm constantly testing my work. It never stops, and the frequency of my testing, has virtually nothing to do with whether or not anyone else tests, or even gives me any feedback.I use Apple's TestFlight for my team testing. It registers -roughly- how many times the app under test is run by individual team members.My own testing is always an order of magnitude greater than the next person, and that is just a fraction of how many times I run it in the simulator, before releasing the test build.I'm not especially upset about that, but I don't spare a lot of sympathy for folks that complain about something after shipping, that they had every chance to catch, beforehand.But, if they are right, I'll still fix it. I just won't feel very sorry for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the largest cause of wasted programming time is building things based on what sounds plausibly useful rather than what is actually useful. It's not an easy question to answer, but it needs to be asked constantly to avoid the trap.Many of us have had the experience of spending an entire weekend feverishly hacking on something that was going to change the world, only to have someone point out a critical flaw in our assumptions as soon as they try it.This is why scratching your own itch is so effective. If you make something that you actually use every day, you might be on to something. Going from 0 to 1 users is the hardest step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is something I call latent product development. Many times, the best solution is not the first one you think of - even though it may be one of many correct solutions.I have found that the best products and product features have come from latent thinking. Subconsciously pondering the problem and letting the solution arise. An example of this is a solution which comes to you in the shower - I don't know why the shower is such a hotbed for latent ideas to emerge - someone should study that!What I found most displeasing at large companies is that there's no room for latent product development. Everything is rushed. Even brand new product ideas, once the machine gets a hold of it, gets put on the conveyor belt for new ideas at a predictable and imposed rate.One such example is my last startup. We had wanted to make it easy for users not on our platform to collaborate. It was a product feature we talked about for a year but nothing ever felt right. Until one morning at 2am while I was sleeping on a recliner at my sister's house in Mali - it came to me. It also turns out that this feature was the first feature we would relaunch after being acquired by Western Digital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602273</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The document is an article by Russell L. Ackoff that explores the concept of "mess management" in organizational settings. Ackoff argues that traditional problem-solving methods often fail to address complex issues that exist as "messes," which are interrelated problems without clear boundaries. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of various factors and advocates for a holistic, systems-thinking approach to management. The article outlines strategies for effectively managing messes, including fostering collaboration, encouraging creativity, and focusing on long-term solutions rather than quick fixes. Overall, Ackoff highlights the necessity for managers to reframe their thinking to navigate complexity successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not the Zettelkasten or the Dewey Decimal System but those topics were also possibly discussed in that hackernews thread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting to realize "clinician" is nowadays usually in a medical context -- but nonetheless, this paper's pure categorization of problem solving was prophetic of mainstream medicine's hubris and incentives:    
&gt; "Groups, like individuals, tend not to be aware of what they do not know and need to know."And, 
&gt; "Such discussions are more likely to suppress symptoms than relieve ailments."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russell Ackoff's lectures are always a great listen, and worth relistening to each year.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a detailed exploration of the Einstein summation convention, an efficient notation used in mathematics and physics to simplify expressions involving summation over indices. It features an interactive tool that allows users to input tensor algebra formulas and visualize the corresponding Einstein summation representation, enhancing understanding of tensor operations. The site also includes explanations, examples, and intuitive guides to help users grasp the concepts behind the notation and its applications in various scientific and mathematical fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found that thinking of tensors in terms of graphs make Einsums much more natural.For example, a matrix product MN, `a b, b c -&gt; a c` is just two nodes with two edges each: `-a- M -b- N -c-`. Their `b` edges are connected, so the resulting graph has only two "free" edges `a` and `c`. That's how we know the result is another matrix.Once you look at tensors this way, a number of things that are normally tricky with standard matrix notation become trivial. Such a higher order derivatives used in neural networks.I wrote https://tensorcookbook.com/ to give a simple reference for all of this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was pretty confused by this for a while. I think the context I was missing is that this is about a function in nympy called ‘einsum’ which is somewhat related to Einstein summation notation.To write a little more: there are two things people mean by ‘tensor’. One is a kind of geometric object that corresponds to a multilinear map between vector spaces (or modules, I suppose), and another is a array indexed by k-tuples (ie what would be called a multidimensional array in C or Fortran programming). For a given choice basis, one can represent a degree k tensor with a k-dimensional array of scalars.Only certain operations make sense geometrically on tensors (in the sense that they do not depend on the choice of basis) and these can be broken down into:- tensor products, which take degree n and m tensors and output a degree (n + m) tensor- contractions which take a degree n tensor and output a degree (n-2) tensor- generalized transpositions which take a degree n tensor and output a degree n tensorA matrix multiplication can be seen as a composition of a tensor product and a contraction; a matrix trace is just a contraction.The Einstein summation convention is a notation which succinctly expresses these geometric operations by describing what one does with the ‘grid of numbers’ representation, combined with the convention that, if an index is repeated in a term twice (an odd number bigger than 1 is meaningless, an even number is equivalent to reapplying the ‘twice’ rule many times) one should implicitly sum the expression for each basis vector for that index. You get: tensor products by juxtaposition, contractions by repeated indexes, and transpositions by reordering indexes.In numpy, it is for general computation rather than expressing something geometric so one doesn’t need the restrictions on number of times an index occurs. Instead I guess the rule is something like:- if index is only on lhs, sum over it- if index on lhs and rhs then don’t sum- if index only on rhs or repeated on rhs, errorAnd computationally I guess it’s something like (1) figure out output shape and (2):  for output_index of output:
    p = 1
    for (input, input_indexes) of (inputs, lhs):
      p = p * input[input_indexes(output_index)]
    output[output_index] = p&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish Python had tools to support combining tensors a la einsum but with arbitrary operations instead of just  multiplication and addition. The only tool I'm aware of that provides a very slickk interface for this is Tullio in Julia.Among other things, that would make a lot of codde very convenient -- including graph algorithms. This is the idea behind GraphBLAS https://graphblas.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587056</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the merits of using printf debugging as a valid and effective method for identifying and fixing bugs in programming. It argues that despite the rise of sophisticated debugging tools, printf debugging remains valuable due to its simplicity and directness. The author highlights that it can be particularly useful for quick testing and for beginners who may find complex debugging tools overwhelming. The post also emphasizes that while printf debugging may not always be the most efficient for larger projects, it allows developers to understand their code better and can be successfully integrated into more complex debugging practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a reproducible test case that runs reasonably quickly, then I think printf debugging is usually just as good as a "real" debugger, and a lot easier. I typically have my test output log open in one editor frame. I make a change to the code in another frame, save it, my build system immediately re-runs the test, and the test log immediately refreshes. So when the test isn't working, I just keep adding printfs to get more info out of the log until I figure it out.This sounds so dumb but it works out to be equivalent to some very powerful debugger features. You don't need a magical debugger that lets you modify code on-the-fly while continuing the same debug session... just change the code and re-run the test. You don't need a magical record-replay debugger that lets you go "back in time"... just add a printf earlier in the control flow and re-run the test. You don't need a magical debugger that can break when a property is modified... just temporarily modify the property to have a setter function and printf in the setter.Most importantly, though, this sort of debugging is performed using the same language and user interface I use all day to write code in the first place, so I don't have to spend time trying to remember how to do stuff in a debugger... it's just code.BUT... this is all contingent on having fast-running automated tests that can reproduce your bugs. But you should have that anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the hardest bugs I've investigated required the extreme version of debugging with printf: sprinkling the code with dump statements to produce about 500GiB of compressed binary trace, and writing a dedicated program to sift through it.The main symptom was a non-deterministic crash in the middle of a 15-minute multi-threaded execution that should have been 100% deterministic. The debugger revealed that the contents of an array had been modified incorrectly, but stepping through the code prevented the crash, and it was not always the same array or the same position within that array. I suspected that the array writes were somehow dependent on a race, but placing a data breakpoint prevented the crash. So, I started dumping trace information. It was a rather silly game of adding more traces, running the 15-minute process 10 times to see if the overhead of producing the traces made the race disappear, and trying again.The root cause was a "read, decompress and return a copy of data X from disk" method which was called with the 2023 assumption that a fresh copy would be returned every time, but was written with the 2018 optimization that if two threads asked for the same data "at the same time", the same copy could be returned to both to save on decompression time...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gotten an OS to run on a new platform with a debugging tool portfolio consisting of a handful of LEDs and a pushbutton. After getting to the point where I could printf() to the console felt like more than anyone could ever ask for.Anecdote aside, it certainly doesn't hurt to be able to debug things without a debugger if it comes to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607087</guid></item><item><title>34. 2DGD_F0TH A compendium of the community knowledge on game design and development</title><link>https://github.com/2DGD-F0TH/2DGD_F0TH</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Jool, a user-space implementation of NAT64, which enables IPv6 clients to communicate with IPv4 servers by translating between the two protocols. It outlines the importance of NAT64 in transitioning networks from IPv4 to IPv6, especially as IPv4 address depletion continues. The content covers installation, configuration, and operational details for Jool, emphasizing its efficiency and compatibility with various systems. Additionally, it provides examples and instructions for setting up NAT64 environments, showcasing the tool's features and benefits for network administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK IPv6 Council has a bunch of videos on running IPv6-mostly/only networks:* https://www.youtube.com/@ukipv6council468/videosThis includes at academic institutions where it's basically all BYOD so they have to deal with a more 'random' assortment of systems:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-liebzcOMAnd enterprise networks, like Jen Linkova at Google:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb98hAb5_W8Jen also had a presentation recently (2024-11) at RIPE87, "Mission Possible: How Google Plans to Turn Off IPv4!", where they've managed to reclaim 300K IPv4 addresses:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRsi6mbAWMShe's currently co-chair of the IETF IPv6 Maintenance (6man) working group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAT64 covers most of the cases. However, in my homelab experiements I very quickly found out that IPv4 literal addresses are a bit problematic for me.There are ways to fix that with 464XLAT/CLAT, but I never got around to deploying it.These days I'm just running dual-stack, with no NAT64. I hate NAT with a burning passion, so adding another layer of stateful NAT is a bit of a net negative in my eyes.Someday I'll go full IPv6 on my home network with 464XLAT. And then I'll realize that some stupid IoT device or something is not CLAT aware. Obviously there are solutions around that too, but they require an intermediate device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used Jool! It worked great, but with some caveats.My ISP does DS-lite which is some abomination where the shared (split by port) IPv4 address is calculated based on the IPv6 address? Using a fixed mapping table? Which is both very popular here and has zero linux support.They had another option to do PPPoE IPv4 + SLAAC IPv6, but for this option they didn't support DHCP prefix delegation.  So I had to use this, and to work around that I needed to make my IPv6 network bridged.The problem is Jool hooks into the linux routing table, and in the bridged network none of the outbound packets reach that table.  So I had to 1. rewrite their RAs with my own DNS64 server and 2. mangle NAT64 packets to look as if they're sent to the router directly so they hit the routing table (and get processed by Jool): https://github.com/andrewbaxter/portalino/blob/main/source/o...Then I hit random MTU issues. MTU should be auto configured (and fixed when there's issues) but I saw problems with Chrome/Firefox refusing to load pages until I tried again at least 30s later until I forced the MTU lower.So close, but still so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607934</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolving role and public perception of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), highlighting how its diverse research objectives and innovations have adapted over time in response to national security needs and technological advancements. It emphasizes the agency's focus on fostering transformative technologies, the shift in its image from a secretive government body to a more transparent and collaborative organization, and the implications of its work on both military and civilian sectors. The piece reflects on how DARPA's changing faces represent broader trends in science, technology, and defense in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was only involved in government contracting for a bit in the twenty-ought tens, but the whole bit about silly requirements and by picking the lowest bidder you were selecting the contributor that "often is the one who understands the technology least" gives me flashbacks to my time in government contracting.I wasn't around for the whole JTRS fiasco, but from what I heard this effect played out there as well. Ridiculous requirements such as requiring only software updates to support new waveforms and restrictions on SWaP as well as unrealistic network sizes resulted in radios so expensive they couldn't be widely deployed. I know some people like to point to SRW as a success coming out of that, but it never has been successfully deployed to within an order of magnitude of the number of radios in the requirements and resulted in a third, incompatible, radio system used by infantry. Meanwhile, a company that was excluded from the program built the radio that the military actually needed, which could communicate to both of their existing systems.I was around for it's successor where they swapped software for FPGAs and made the same "software only" update requirement. The primary winner of the contract had no experience in digital logic and decided to implement the thing in MatLab (which provided no real mechanism for multiple clock domains or other features needed for high performance large scale digital design). Other contractors had to fit their design into this mess of a system. When it didn't fit in any FPGA, they opted to put it in an ASIC. And another of the contractors managed to convince the PM that their newest dev board was perfect for integrating this -- allowing them to pay for the internal R&amp;D for that board on the project's expense (after all PCIE and SRIO are practically the same, right?).I left at that point because failure was the only option and I could make more money writing code to meet silly requirements in the tech sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article is very interesting and focuses on the historic faces of DARPA, not really getting too much into the modern state of the agency. Over the past 10+ years DARPA have embraced the OTA - other transaction authority - as a contract vehicle to allow DARPA PMs additional flexibility and speed in letting contracts. This has allowed, perhaps, a return to more of the ideas of the old days in which a performer and PM might seek that "meeting of the minds" mentioned in the article, and issue funding to start work.A real limitation perhaps that DARPA has is the 3-5 year PM timeline. PMs start with a project and vision for their work, often a multiphase effort. We often joke that the challenges DARPA offers are not all that difficult, only the schedule is. A few years ago I worked on what would have been a wonderful project on a 2 year timeline which was compressed to half that, with the usual shifting sands of requirements consuming the majority of the allocated time.I can't say that giving PMs a longer timeframe would be a good thing - that 3-5 year PM clock keeps everything moving apace. Perhaps the longer-term programs ought to be given by the office directors to PMs, but then you have the disadvantage (mentioned in the article) of PMs having to execute a project they don't believe in. That hasn't worked well; disengaged PMs, focused on their passion projects, don't give the needed attention to inherited assignments.The future of the agency is concerning. Given increasing time and funding limitations, coupled with the Heilmeier focus, there's been a tremendous push towards immediate results. Which means simpler targets that don't provide the amazing leaps ahead that DARPA was once known for. Look to their current SBIR topics, which include one on the use of language models for suicide prevention, and another on processing data to generate facility clearances. These are not leaps ahead, but instead incremental, focused improvements. We once lost a DARPA proposal because our plan was too certain to work, they wanted more risk. Quite a change.DARPA still hires visionary PMs, and they have the tools again to realize these visions. I hope to see a return to the DARPA referenced in the early article. It will be fun to pitch ideas to those guys. I'm tired of talking to the ones who are too focused on today to think about tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585409</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO until the abstract logging interface is built into the language, or standard library, we'll keep building different log libraries and adapters between them, and shipping libraries without logging.It makes me actively disinterested in these libraries. I just want some built in interface with levels, hierarchy, and structured logging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never really caught on with the idea of integrating external I/O in something as fundamental as logging. More often that not a pull vs push approach is suited for logging. There are dozens of high performant log collectors/aggregators who can collect, transform, and push logs to N number of stores. What’s the advantage of doing this right inside the app? (Besides maybe serverless functions?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s frustrating that this is necessary but it definitely makes sense, and I will probably add it to several projects soon.Thanks for your hard work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606454</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very interesting. I played around with (dependently) typed combinatory logic a while ago, using a system called "illative combinatory logic" http://www.chriswarbo.net/blog/2012-12-01-typed_combinators.... and I agree that's it's hard to actually use ;)I was approaching typed combinator expressions as a target for AI systems (this predated transformers; I was thinking more like genetic programming, inductive programming, etc.), but in order to trust the results it would need to be free from paradoxes (like Type : Type).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependent Types + Combinatory Logic is highly non-trivial, as is shown in this series of work by Altenkirch et al.:https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.F...https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol269-typ...https://types2023.webs.upv.es/slides/S22/TYPES2023-Altenkirc...I wonder: Where does rholang3 fit in this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if combinators could be useful for neurosymbolic AI—either in the backward pass (e.g., training models on synthetic data) or the forward pass (e.g., iterative code generation with evolutionary algorithms). Combinators feel alien, making even Haskell or APL seem intuitive, but maybe that’s because they don’t align with human working memory. Language models, with their massive context windows, handle long-range dependencies in sequences well, even if their understanding is shallower in some ways. Could combinators, with their compositional and deductive nature, be a better fit for machines than humans? For example, instead of generating Python functions in an evolutionary approach[0], could we use combinators as the building blocks? They’re compact, formal, and inherently step-by-step, which might make them ideal for tasks requiring structured reasoning and generalization.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the investment in Silicon Box, a company specializing in advanced chiplet packaging technology. The authors highlight the growing demand for efficient and scalable packaging solutions in the semiconductor industry, driven by the need for improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced flexibility in chip design. They emphasize Silicon Box's innovative approach, which combines chiplets—smaller chips that can be packaged together—allowing for greater customization and performance optimization. The piece outlines the potential impact of this technology on the future of chip manufacturing and the strategic reasoning behind the investment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their “value added” list seems mostly good. But I’m confused about/sceptical of:&gt; Reduced Power Consumption: The smaller size of individual chiplets contributes to lower power consumption. Each chiplet can be optimized for energy efficiency, and the overall system can be designed to minimize power waste. This feature is particularly crucial as the demand for energy-efficient technology grows in sectors like mobile computing and data centers.Each chiplet can be designed to minimize power consumption? Of course, sure, anything can be designed to minimize power consumption. The overall system can be designed to minimize power waste? Sure, I guess. But do the chiplets actually help there? If they are saying chiplets help there—I don’t see it. If they are saying they can work around it and it doesn’t hurt as much as you’d expect, I believe them.Overall I’d expect chiplets to have slightly higher power consumption than a similar monolithic chip. The network isn’t free. There’s some loss of flexibility as the design has to be broken up over multiple chips.But I’d also expect the higher yields should let them use newer process nodes, so in the end… the choice of a similar monolithic chip is probably not available!Also I guess they could do better power gating than a monolithic design probably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one of their founders passed on, so much knowledge is now lost :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585438</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This book is middling at best. From a literary perspective it's terrible. It reads like GPT-3.5 wrote it. Now from an introduction to a new idea perspective and understanding how AI will affect society, its __fine__. The book is full of contradictions. Suleyman regularly points out how we've __never__ successfully constrained a disrupting technological innovation and then says we NEED to here. I mean, absolutely absurd stuff. Ostensibly ends on an optimistic note, but is actually much more nihilistic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is the head of Microsoft AI. Gates might not be entirely unbiased here :)edit: as a semi-related question for folks here. How often do you 'vet' authors of non-fiction books prior to reading the book?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The historian Yuval Noah Harari has argued that humans should figure out how to work together and establish trust before developing advanced AI. In theory, I agree. If I had a magic button that could slow this whole thing down for 30 or 40 years while humanity figures out trust and common goals, I might press it. But that button doesn’t exist. These technologies will be created regardless of what any individual or company does.Is that true, though? Training runs for frontier models don’t happen without enormous resources and support. You don’t run one in your garage. It doesn’t happen unless people make it happen.Is this really a harder coordination problem than, say, stopping climate change, which Gates does believe is worth trying?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602850</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one thing few are willing to admit is that a large blame for this can be placed on disinterested parents. Parents that believe it is solely the school/teacher's job to educate their child.When kids are at home, parents should be involved in the learning process. You don't have to be a helicopter and monitor everything, but you should take interest in the work your child is doing. If you check in at least once while they're doing homework it will be very easy to catch issues like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm close to someone who teaches at a university, and they're making heavy use of in-room essays written in blue books. This ensures that the work is purely the students, but I think it also has the side-effect that the grader is also working manually.I kinda think maybe at earlier levels, most homework should be moved into the classroom and done on paper anyway? What's the point of homework if they're not going to do it themselves and they're not going to learn? So just push that back into the classroom and don't try to take up their time out of school needlessly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also have young relatives who are using this technology (a bit older though, teenagers). One problematic thing I see is not knowing just how inaccurate these answers are. Somehow many people just assume complete correctness and accuracy because that's how they think of or have been primed to think of technology. Of course, the marketing and hype when it comes to AI doesn't help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611844</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concepts of magic links and passkeys as modern alternatives to traditional password systems for authentication. It explains how magic links work by allowing users to log in via a link sent to their email, thereby eliminating the need for remembering passwords. Passkeys, on the other hand, leverage public key cryptography to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication method across devices. The piece emphasizes the benefits of these technologies, such as improved security, reduced risk of phishing attacks, and enhanced user experience, while also addressing potential challenges in their implementation and user adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magic links have rough edges, Passkeys have black holes.&gt; On this blog I speak only for myself as someone experienced in usable security and website authentication.This caveat near the top speaks to my point, if you're a developer and you understand what an SSH key is, you'll take to Passkeys no problem. But if you aren't, there are many foot guns abound and vendor lock-in you won't notice until it bites you.I work for an auth company, I use a Yubikey and Passkeys all the time, in a business context where there is an IT admin to go to when there is a problem, I think Passkeys will do great. They'll really improve the average security posture of an organization.But I would dread having to try and recover a Passkey with Google, who would I even talk to? I just had to explain what a VPN was to my parents, I would not be excited to try and explain to them how Passkeys work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passkeys are going to be a complete failure, because a) vendor lock-in. I can easily move a password around; it's just a string. As far as I understand it, major passkey implementations are basically non-portable.And b) I don't understand them. If I don't understand them what chance does the average non-nerd have? I probably could understand them, if I bothered to look into the details of how they work, but I really don't want to have to do that and normal people won't either. Nobody needs to do research to understand passwords or email login links (at least at a basic level).I predict they will be abandoned in 10 years.I wonder if a better solution is just to accept email-is-authority and make the magic link flow more seamless. Imagine if you could link your email client and your web browser closely together so that every site that offered a magic link "just worked". You click a button, it emails you, your email client silently notifies the web browser and deletes the email, and then you get logged in.Google could easily do that automatically with Gmail and Chrome. The only downside I can see is that email is still a bit slower than password authentication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think magic links and passkeys are awful for websites. I have refused to give services money because their only login system is a magic link, passkey or using a 3rd party login. For example, I got some free credits for clipdrop.co, I like their service, even setup the API and got everything working, but when it was time to buy some real credits and give them money, their login system was so awful I just found an alternative with a path of least resistance.Another company I wanted to give lots of money too was fal.ai, but you can only login through github, which I didn't want to do. I even emailed them asking about alternatives but they couldn't even bother to reply. So my money was spent else where.I don't have my email login on my computer so for every tragic link I get that means I would either have to find a way to get the link from my phone to the computer or login to my email from the computer just to click that stupid link.You know what faster, more efficient and better in every way? Using an user and password.I should not have to suffer because some nitwits can't remember their passwords, we should not subsidize mediocrity because we will get more mediocrity.Thank you for reading my rant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607455</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide on how to use Common Lisp to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on music sheets found in YouTube videos. It outlines the process, starting from extracting frames from a video to analyzing those frames for musical scores. The tutorial details the necessary tools, libraries, and coding techniques required to successfully implement OCR for music, helping users to convert and transcribe music notation directly from video content into a digital format.&lt;/p&gt;

  l2  = length(gzip(i2))
  l12 = length(gzip(concatenate(i1, i2))

  ncd = (l12 - min(l1, l2))/max(l1, l2)

&lt;p&gt;The article on the "Raising of Chicago" details the ambitious engineering project in the late 19th century responsible for elevating many buildings in Chicago to combat frequent flooding and improve sanitation. Initiated in response to the city's challenges with stormwater and sewage management, the process involved lifting structures using jacks and adjusting their foundations as well as altering the street levels. This monumental endeavor transformed Chicago's landscape, allowing for better drainage systems and contributing to the city’s growth and modernization. The project is noted for its ingenuity and the impact it had on urban planning and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if this was during the same time period or not, but in some parts of the city (mostly residential or smaller commercial areas) they didn't bother raising the buildings, they just built the streets up higher and added flying walkways from the new sidewalk height to the new front entrances on the second story of the houses. Many of them had stairs that went down to the old ground level and I think in most of them they had been converted to separate apartments.My dad's small commercial building in Pilsen looked normal, but if you peeked into the holes in the sidewalk out front you could see a vaulted space underneath where the old sidewalk used to be, which was kind of unnerving when you realized the sidewalk was crumbling. You could even access it from the basement of his building (which I suppose used to be the ground level?), but he never let me go down there as a kid.I also know of one or two old homes from around this time period in the neighborhood I grew up in (which wasn't part of Chicago at this time) that were later moved off what became the main avenue through the area to new locations about a block away. I think that happened much later though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole concept is bonkers! By this i mean that i can not imagine many officials would even have the will to even try something so big and audacious nowadays. Also, my favorite note in the wikipedia entry (besides the whole article being awesome!), is this one: "Many of the city's old wooden buildings were considered not worth raising, so instead the owners of these wooden buildings had them either demolished or else placed on rollers and moved to the outskirts of Chicago. Business activities in such buildings continued, as they were being moved." Just crazy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently Sna Francisco also has the tradition of moving houses, most recently in 2021 https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/22/victorian-ho...The Guardian also has an article written back then: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/23/san-francisc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611978</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I resonate with Dubray's sentiments. Maybe it's because I just turned 50 and am more contemplative at the half-century mark, but I feel anymore like I'm playing a part in peddling schlock and snake oil. Our industry is increasingly selling products that are extractive and zero-sum as opposed to being the tide that lifts all boats. Was I always living a lie in a way, or have things truly become qualitatively worse over the past 10 or 15 years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to sound like an elitist ahole but this all worked so much better when it was a small, self selecting group of users.But the most disenfranchising part of all this is how quickly/how willing tech people were to allow/promote/encourage awfulness and destructiveness for $$$. I had such a different view of that scene in the 90s/early 2000s. But the good news is we are self reflecting and not happy with the current status quo. Hopefully we don't settle for the 'hide in our gated community' discord model but come up with something better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think software engineering is inherently a management job. When you write code, you write company policy, but that policy isn't followed by human employees, it's followed by electronic employees - computers.These electronic employees are very good at following very simple instructions. They enable the business to handle enormous numbers of customers concurrently, but those customers can only be handled in the way that the software engineers planned for.The author complains about businesses that operate two-sided markets, which is an economic function traditionally handled by governments. Governments imposed lots of regulations, but Uber, DoorDash and their ilk decided to do away with all that. This resulted in litanies of scandals, and the businesses rapidly putting these poorly-implemented policies in place. It turns out that all those regulations, accumulated over centuries, were actually necessary to ensure that the markets functioned properly. The wunderkind founders made their billions by burning Chesterton's fences.Generation Z, I understand, is increasingly abandoning dating apps, because the apps aren't optimised for connecting their users with compatible partners. If all the cool kids are finding their relationships offline, then eventually it'll just be the uncool looking for love on the internet (just like in the dial-up days).In a similar way, if it's too much of a pain in the arse to deal with a delivery app, then some restaurants will stop dealing with them, and rely on word of mouth. If every other restaurant is on the delivery apps, then the restaurant that isn't on the apps suddenly becomes the 'hidden gem', the place you hear about from that colleague who likes to drop names to show everyone that they're cool.(On the other hand, if you're running the slightly-below-average pizza place that people call when they can't be bothered to cook, then you should probably be on the apps. This is a matter of market positioning.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613550</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Reflections" by Sam Altman discusses key insights and observations from his experiences in the tech industry and entrepreneurship. Altman shares lessons on the importance of community, the dynamics of innovation, and the value of building a supportive network for startups. He emphasizes the significance of persistence and adaptability in the face of challenges and offers thoughts on the future of technology, particularly around artificial intelligence and its societal impacts. Overall, the piece serves as a personal reflection on growth and the evolving landscape of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an incredibly vague essay. Let me be more explicit: I think this is a clear sign of a bubble. LLMs are very cool technology, but they are not the second coming. It can't do experiments; it doesn't have an imagination; it doesn't have an ethical framework; its not an agent in any human sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my mind, LLMs are lowering the barrier of searching in the same way Google did in the early 2000s. Back then, you had to very specifically tailor your search key words, not use words such as "the," "a," etc. Google eventually managed to turn queries such as "what's the population of Ghana" into ready-made answers.LLMs do exactly that for more complex queries, with the downside of possible hallucinations. Suddenly, instead of doing a research on the topic, a person looking to become "a programmer" asks ChatGPT to create a syllabus for their situation, and possibly even actually generate the contents of the syllabus. ChatGPT then "searches the internet" and creates the response.I have gained confidence that LLMs won't be much more (at least in the next couple years) than search engines with the upside of responding to complex queries, and downside of hallucinations. And for that, I find LLMs quite useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As AI has continued to improve quickly, it’s been interesting to watch the sentiment of the tech community get more negative on it. “It’s not very good yet.” “No improvement since GPT-4.”Objectively, today’s AI is incredibly impressive and valuable. We blew past the Turing test and yet no one seems to marvel at that.I’d argue and we still have yet to discover the most effective ways to incorporate the existing models into products. We could stop progress now and have compelling product launches for the next few years that change industries. I’m confident customer support will be automated shortly - a previously large industry for human employment.Is the negative sentiment fear from tech folks because they have a lot to lose? Am I just not understanding something? It feels like I can watch the progress unfold, but yet the community here continues to say nothing is happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606700</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the philosophical and ethical implications of different approaches to governance by comparing fascism and liberal democracy. It argues that while both systems enforce societal norms, fascism employs a more rigid and oppressive structure contrasted with the more flexible and adaptive nature of liberal democracy. The author examines the historical context of these ideologies, highlighting the appeal of fascism in times of crisis and the importance of critical thinking and vigilance in protecting democratic values against authoritarian tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think maybe the article goes too far, perhaps begging the question.  It is one thing to say that people have unreconcilable beliefs, ones that cause insult or injury as a result of that conflict.  It is harder to put them in categories and say that "fascism" is forcing a belief on other people out of a desire to reduce harm and "rakishness" is acting consistent with another set of beliefs that does not find harm in that behavior.  I don't know of a philosophically acceptable definition of rakishness, but Fascism has several definitions by both proponents and detractors.  Proponents would say that it has an element of blotting out weak, foreign things and promoting strong, native things.  Detractors would say that it is whatever is needed to get people to fear and hate an outgroup.  Umberto Eco's definition of "ur-Fascism" proposed a framework of features that go together but not necessarily found in every Fascist belief system.  I like that definition because it doesn't require people to explicitly call their movement Fascist and it presents the beliefs/behavior as something more innate to the human experience and not a product of modernity.The dilution of the word Fascist to mean someone who would censor you for some reason, has been bad for discussions of Fascism and its ilk.  Now the word seems to include the person who asks you to show them respect by using their correct name or pronouncing it correctly, as well as the person who would execute you for writing "sick" literature that contradicts a fascist belief system, somehow equating the two.Are there rakes in the world?  Do some people think they are not rakes, while other people think they are?  Probably.  But maybe it is better to try to agree on what is really going on in real discussions, rather than hypotheticals about candies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ITT missing the forest for the trees and focusing on- The incorrect definition of "fascist". The article is just using the word as a label for "people who don't let others do things that don't hurt anyone". Yeah it should've used another label like "authoritarian" or "wall", but the ultimate message is the same.- Over-analyzing the rules: "you should let people do what they want, unless they're hurting other people" but what if "hurt" is something stupid like "going outside hurts me because you're ugly"? This is the first half of the ultimate message, the article agrees that people assign stupid meanings to "hurt" and that is the source of many disagreements.- The article suggesting you try logic and morals to persuade someone who isn't following logic and morals. The second half of the ultimate message is that sometimes you think someone isn't acting logically or morally (ex: the person trying to stop you from eating tictacs because they're on a power-trip) when they are (ex: said person is really tying to stop you because they believe tic-tacs are sentient, which if true, would justify intervention). And yes, some people are on power-trips or otherwise acting in bad faith. But most people simultaneously believe they use logic and morals, and most other people don't; because people don't act as rationally and morally as they think, and (the article's message) they mis-judge others as bad-intentioned when they're good-intentioned but have bad assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those non-native speakers confused by this usage of the word “rake” like me, it’s, apparently, the meaning under “Etymology 6” on Wiktionary: https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/rake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608758</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here.I wrote this book so you can spend a boring weekend writing an operating system from scratch. You don’t have to write it in C - you can use your favorite programming language, like Rust or Zig.I intentionally made it not UNIX-like and kept only the essential parts. Thinking about how the OS differs from Linux or Windows can also be fun. Designing an OS is like creating your own world—you can make it however you like!BTW, you might notice some paragraphs feel machine-translated because, to some extent, they are. If you have some time to spare, please send me a PR. The content is written in plain Markdown [1].Hope you enjoy :)[1] https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines/tree/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very delightful article. Based on my experience in "hobby" OS programming, I would add setting up GDB debugging as early as possible. It was a great help in my projects and an improvement over debugging with the QEMU monitor only.QEMU contains a built-in GDB server, you'll need a GDB client built for the target architecture (riscv in this case) and connecting to the QEMU GDB server over the network.https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/gdb.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For any rust enthusiasts, phil-opp's guide is such a fun exercise to try out. It was actually the first thing I tried in Rust (very silly idea) and ended up only understanding ~5% of what I had just typed out.I tried it again 2-3 years later and took the time to go over each subject. I even planned in advance to make sure I was going to finish it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631873</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the security vulnerabilities associated with 512-bit DKIM RSA keys in email authentication. It highlights how these keys can be cracked using modern computing power, making them insufficient for protecting email integrity. The text emphasizes the importance of using stronger key lengths, like 2048 bits, to enhance security against potential attacks. Additionally, it provides insights into the techniques used for cracking weak keys and urges users to update their DKIM configurations to ensure better protection for email communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth look into the operations of a voice phishing crew, showcasing their tactics, techniques, and the daily grind of scamming individuals. It details how these scammers leverage social engineering, technology, and psychological manipulation to create a convincing narrative that leads victims to divulge sensitive personal information. The piece also highlights the financial motivations behind these schemes and underscores the broader implications for cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and preventive measures against such scams.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My parents' independent gas station in rural western Ohio (in a town of sub-1000 population, albeit on a state route that sees significant commuter traffic) was targeted for a voice phishing scam over the last week. A caller left voice messages to multiple recipients (we're not sure how many, but it seems like at least double-digits) purporting to be the gas station and asking to settle-up unpaid bills via credit card over the phone. I didn't get to hear any of the callers, unfortunately. The call-back number they left wasn't the gas station's number, nor was the caller ID the gas station's number.At first I felt like it was probably a small-time local scammer. Then I thought about how close we are to being able to run this entire scam using fully automated means (including voice assistant software and an LLM to talk to the callers, probably with a human in the loop for handing exceptions). I assume we'll see a rash of these kinds of scams targeting local businesses once the tool kits to run them become widely available.The idea of building up the automation to run that scam sounds like fun. I wouldn't actually do it but somebody with fewer moral scruples absolutely will (or, rather, probably already has).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have gotten a few of those "Apple" phishing attempts. They really look legit. My Apple ID got compromised, many years ago, and people try to use it, from time to time.However, I am pretty up on the state of my accounts, so I won't follow up on them.The only people who ever call me, from Apple, are the Developer Support folks, and that's usually to castigate me, for stepping on some soft spot, or in response to me reaching out to them. I totally ignore calls from numbers that I don't know; a rare privilege.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many non-techy folks that are getting run over by phishers. If tech workers can also be targeted, the rest really have no hope.I really wish someone would make movies or enticing thriller series out of these post-mortems. There are some good stories to be told, plus it would help the most vulnerable to be better prepared..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42629163</guid></item><item><title>5.

People who are really into staying up all night dancing to techno music aren't buying expensive alcoholic drinks, they're buying cheap water to stay hydrated. Many (though by no means all) take drugs, but generally that means one dose of a drug like MDMA at the beginning of the evening. Psychedelic drugs like LSD are also associated with the rave scene but are less compatible with a nightclub environment (bars, security, overgrown disco lights). People are more likely to consume psychedelics at an outdoor party or a warehouse space.In my view what has killed raves was the declining availability of cheap accessible commercial spaces, police/administrative hostility to informal economic activity, and overcommercialization, which has tended to select for the shittiest music/DJs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One big change is that they got better and much more organized. I go to an annual event with a few hundred of my friends and family. We rent a lodge in a national forest, set up an enormous sound system, and dance for 3 days around some very confused deer. There are food trucks and coffee bars and dozens of portapotties scattered around, plus daytime poolside sets while we swim around and listen to 100dB house.We grayvers still like to have fun, just more comfortably. We have work next week, you know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606318</guid></item><item><title>6.

This would have been incredibly useful to have found when I was writing my own implicit-surface drawer. My approach is similar in some ways (interval arithmetic), and different in others (not as optimized, I directly produce GLSL for a fragment shader).Honestly I'm tempted to just toss everything away and replace it with (a reimplementation of) this. Dunno if I should be happy or sad about that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634624</guid></item><item><title>10.

I clicked on it expecting it to be almost impossible to useInstead, I was able to easily navigate everything without getting lostAlso, the speeding up/down controls are excellent, very useful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well done! I could spend a long time on this.One minor suggestion: you should make the labels clickable instead of just the planets/stars. I found it difficult to click on a tiny pixel on screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very nice. I didn't know Pluto's orbit was more inclined than many of the others.It also gives me strong "The Expanse" vibes. Probably because there are so many orbital bodies shown that were mentioned in those books. I also learned that Pallas is an actual asteroid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634787</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a project called NeuralSVG, which focuses on generating vector graphics using neural networks. It explores the integration of machine learning techniques with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create art and design. The project showcases various methods for training neural networks to produce and manipulate vector images, highlighting the potential of this approach in creative fields. Additionally, the site provides examples and code resources for developers interested in experimenting with neural network-generated vector art.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is excellent!I think the utility of generating vectors is far, far greater than all the raster generation that's been a big focus thus far (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc). Those efforts have been incredibly impressive, of course, but raster outputs are so much more difficult to work with. You're forced to "upscale" or "inpaint" the rasters using subsequent generative AI calls to actually iterate towards something useful.By contrast, generated vectors are inherently scalable and easy to edit. These outputs in particular seem to be low-complexity, with each shape composed of as few points as possible. This is a boon for "human-in-the-loop" editing experiences.When it comes to generative visuals, creating simplified representations is much harder (and, IMO, more valuable) than creating highly intricate, messy representations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a huge fan of this type of incremental generative approach. Language isn’t precise enough to describe a final product, so generating intermediate steps is very powerful.I’d also like to see this in music generation. Tools like Suno are cool but I would much rather have something that generates MIDIs and instrument configurations instead.Maybe this is a good lesson for generative tools. It’s possible to generate something that’s a good starting point. But what people actually want is long tail, so including the capability of precision modification is the difference between a canned demo and a powerful tool.&gt; Code coming soonThe examples are quite nice but I have no idea how reproducible they are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been impressed with even applying sonnet to SVGs for animations. This looks like it could be a lot more powerful.Fun example: https://gist.github.com/scosman/701275e737331aaab6a2acf74a52...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42636873</guid></item><item><title>13.

I found it fast-moving, and it focused a lot more on applications than fundamentals, which meant it was more wide than it was deep. This didn't turn out so well when I decided to study ML later and needed stronger linear algebra fundamentals, but it was a fun course. There were a couple interesting course projects, one of which was using linear algebra to balance a (simulated) 2D robot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man this would have been nice when I was in school.For some reason linear algebra still isn't part of standard Mechanical Engineering course load (Calc 1, 2, 3, DiffEq) which made life extremely difficult in some of the later classes. I remember spending weeks brute forcing a lot of things that would have been trivial with a little bit of matrix math.I took a superficially similar class as a 400 level elective but it assumed everyone already knew linear algebra going in, and it was a disaster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633805</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Slack's implementation of automated accessibility testing to enhance the usability of their platform for all users, including those with disabilities. It outlines the importance of accessibility in software development, the tools and methodologies used for testing, and the challenges faced during the integration of automated tests. The team shares their commitment to continuous improvement in accessibility practices and highlights the significance of collaboration and feedback in creating an inclusive experience for all Slack users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little OT but are people running playwright in docker on CI? Curious if it needs to be dockerised for consistent screenshots on local vs CI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am one of the maintainers of the axe accessibility testing engine the Slack team is using. It's awesome to see such a detailed writeup of how folks are building on our team's work!We publish the engine (axe-core) and the "core" playwright integration library Slack is using (@axe-core/playwright) as open source, but if you're interested in what the Slack team has described in this blog, we also have a paid offering called axe Developer Hub (https://www.deque.com/axe/developer-hub) that offers a similar workflow to what the Slack folks describe here: It hooks into end-to-end tests you already have to add in accessibility testing without needing a ton of code changes to your test suite.It's very enlightening to see which features the Slack folks prioritized for their setup and to see some of the stuff they were able to do by going deep on integration with Playwright specifically. It's not often you are lucky enough to get feedback as strong as "we cared about &lt;feature&gt; enough to invest a bunch of engineering time into it".If you're interested in building these sort of accessibility tools, my team is hiring! https://www.deque.com/careers/senior-accessibility-tool-deve...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article about accessibility - code snippets added as images. And what about alt text? It just broadly summarizes what is displayed in image.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Update: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith.They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter.Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate.I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing.Update #2:I appreciate you guys for all of your advice.This platform was never intended to be monetized, and I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end.I'm not planning to pursue this project at this point. If they came up to me at first with the offer to work with them it might be different, but the way they handled it makes me just want to walk away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to UW a decade ago, and back then it was pretty common knowledge that you don't fuck with software and the class registration system. Registering for classes was really competitive and they were really strict about making sure that no one had an edge over anyone else by being able to write code. There were plenty of rumors of people being expelled for using scripts to try to get the classes they wanted right when they opened. I also believe they forbid or at least frowned on students "trading" registrations, because they didn't want even more people trying to sign up for high value classes and trading them as a commodity.So at least back when I went there, basically any CS student could have told you that this website was a horrible idea that is sure to get you in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s just how colleges are. I once reported to my alma mater that a somewhat obscure (but obviously public) link seemed to trigger the download of a zip of student details for no discernible reason (I think it was a WIP site), and they immediately threatened to call the FBI on me. I just sort of laughed it off, but I decided that was the last time I was going to initiate any sort of contact with them if I didn’t absolutely have to.Which is the policy I followed when I found that they had stored one of their LDAP admin passwords in a world readable file on the CS servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42638626</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth explanation of the concept of debouncing in digital electronics, particularly focusing on switches and buttons. It discusses the issues that arise from mechanical switch bounce, which can cause false triggering in circuits. The author explores various techniques to effectively debounce switches, including hardware solutions like RC (resistor-capacitor) filters and software algorithms. The article emphasizes the importance of choosing the right debouncing method based on the specific application requirements and offers detailed examples and considerations to help designers implement effective debouncing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But some environments are notoriously noisy. Many years ago I put a system using several Z80s and a PDP-11 in a steel mill. A motor the size of a house drawing thousands of amps drove the production line. It reversed direction every few seconds. The noise generated by that changeover coupled everywhere, and destroyed everything electronic unless carefully protected. We optocoupled all cabling simply to keep the smoke inside the ICs, where it belongs. All digital inputs still looked like hash and needed an astonishing amount of debounce and signal conditioning.:-)I had a similar experience with a elevator motor and a terminal. The electronics worked absolutely fine, but when someone operated the elevator it occasionally produced phantom keypresses on the capacitive keypad.This was perhaps understandable, but what really confused the users was that these phantom keypresses sometimes pressed the not fitted debug buttons (which weren't on the production keypad) which stuck the device into debug mode!We learnt not to include the debug code in the production firmware and beefed up the transient suppression hardware and the debouncing firmware to fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Years ago a pal and I installed a system for the Secret Service that had thousands of very expensive switches on panels in a control room. We battled with a unique set of bounce challenges because the uniformed officers were too lazy to stand up and press a button. They tossed rulers at the panels from across the room. Different impacts created quite an array of bouncing.It's impossible to guess how users will use a system until they can be observed in the wild.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One vendor told me reliability simply isn't important as users will subconsciously hit the button again and again till the channel changes.Orthogonally to the point of this excellent article, I found it striking how this was probably true, once--and then TVs got smart enough that it took seconds to change channels, instead of milliseconds. And then it was no longer possible for input failures to be corrected subconsciously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601890</guid></item><item><title>18.

Not just because some of those games are deeply ingrained in my childhood, but also because the writing itself is exceptional. The structure is strong, there’s no fluff, and it’s still vivid and playful. I loved it.I also read the author's thoughts on the writing process, and the way he described it closely mirrored how I approach working on music, which was illuminating.I also loved the article about how software development is a form of knowledge building. Once again, excellent writing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark was nice enough to invite me to his home studio when I was a new high school grad to talk working in games as an artist. He told me the story of the fight over dithering. I give him strong partial credit for ending up a game engine/art pipeline coder instead and got to thank him after his most excellent GDC presentation on the lost power of palettized textures https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcJ1Jvtef0You can see that power in action herehttp://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/ (Hit show options)http://www.effectgames.com/effect/article-Old_School_Color_C...BTW: Deluxe Paint has been remade in Python if you want to give it a try https://github.com/mriale/PyDPainter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve heard him recount the story of how he ended up at LucasFilm Games before, so I could tell that ”Mark” refers to Mark Ferrari.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We lost our house to the Eaton fire this morning. It’s difficult to describe the vastness of the destruction in our community. Everything within a couple square miles of us burned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many neighborhoods and landmarks along PCH in Malibu just gone. There's nothing left. Hard to fathom or overstate what the impact of all this will be. Every year I go down to the beach at sunrise on January 1st with my dad. We pulled over somewhere, don't know where, along the way, to catch the sunrise. Today when I first woke up I opened twitter and saw a video of the charred skeletons of the houses right where we were standing just one week ago. Recognized it from the background of the picture I took of him. Fucking insane.edit: much of today has been giving me flashbacks of the Woolsey fire. the only way, probably, this fire today is better than the Woolsey fire, is that there likely won't be a mass shooting the very next day, like what happened back then, at the Borderline shooting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was in Pacific Palisades when the fire started yesterday. I've never seen one spread so fast. It went from there being smoke way in the distance and people going about their lives normally, then 90 minutes later the fire was everywhere and people were panicking and evacuating en masse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42638735</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an optimization approach for the Riemann assignment problem, which involves dividing a space into regions for optimal allocation of resources. It outlines various mathematical concepts and techniques used to solve this problem, including algorithms for efficient computation and the impact of different parameters on the assignment quality. The author also presents examples and visualizations to illustrate the results, providing insights into both the theoretical and practical aspects of the optimization process. Overall, the piece offers a detailed exploration of how mathematical optimization can enhance decision-making in resource allocation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny how things I never expect to see on here pop up occasionally. I had read some of the early papers by Boumal on optimization over Riemannian manifolds in 2016 for a similar problem and even wrote some Julia code for it (before manifolds.jl existed).In my case, I was trying to perform synchronization over a set of noisy point clouds to extract the "ground truth" point cloud. I.e., take the set of coordinates corresponding to a point cloud, randomly permute the order of the coordinates, randomly rotate/reflect the point cloud, and then apply a Gaussian perturbation to each coordinate. Repeat this process multiple times. The goal then is to recover the original point cloud from the noisy rotated/reflected/permuted copies of the original.Boumal and Singer had done some work to solve this problem for just rotations/reflections by essentially "stacking" the unknown orthogonal matrices (i.e., elements of O(3)) into a Stiefel manifold and then performing Riemannian optimization over this manifold. It worked fantastically well and was much faster than prior techniques involving semidefinite programming, so I decided to try the same approach for synchronization over permuted copies of the point cloud, and it also worked quite well. However, one can achieve better convergence properties by performing a discrete Fourier transform over the symmetric group on the sets of point clouds so that instead of optimizing over a Stiefel manifold that is supposed to represent stacked permutation matrices (well, stacked orthogonal matrices with constraints to make them doubly stochastic), you optimize over a manifold of stacked unitary matrices intended to represent irreps of S_n.Ultimately I didn't know enough group theory at the time to figure out how to generate irreps for the "combined" group of O(3) and S_n, so I couldn't solve the problem simultaneously for both rotations/reflections and permutations, but ultimately Singer and Boumal developed an approach that bypassed the synchronization problem altogether by utilizing invariant polynomials to extract the ground truth signal in a more direct way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, the asymptotically fastest known algorithm for minimum weight bipartite matching [A] uses an interior point method, which means it's also doing Riemannian optimization in some sense.[A] https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-achieve-absurdly-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, I’ve always wondered if the assignment problem could be solved as continuous optimization. I’m familiar with manifold optimization but didn’t realize the permutation matrix could be expressed as a manifold.Has this been applied to networks like DETR for object detection? I’ve never been clear on how they made the Hungarian algorithm differentiable (and it seems like their approach has issues).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42603443</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Fold and Monoids" discusses the concept of folding in functional programming, primarily focusing on its relation to monoids. It explains how folding is a technique used to reduce a structure (like a list) to a single value by recursively applying a binary function. The article outlines the properties of monoids—associativity and an identity element—making it clear how they facilitate the folding process. Through examples and code snippets, it illustrates different types of folds, such as left and right folds, and emphasizes their benefits in creating clean and efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure why the article has to mention monads? I mean there’s the (mathematically correct) joke that »monads are monoids in the category of endofunctors«, but understanding that requires getting elbow deep into category theory, and if you’re not one of the maybe 10 people in the world gifted that way has zero practical use when programming.&gt; A monad is a monoid over a set of curried functions.Is that so? Sounds very wrong to me. If we want to go the monad joke way, monads have to have an operation (a -&gt; m b) that composes, but those are just normal functions, and there’s nothing curried about it. It’s a statement that one could bend enough so it’s kind of right, but what it really does is raise eyebrows.&gt; Monads force sequential processing because you set up a pipeline and the earlier stages of the pipeline naturally must run first.No, a counterexample is the (esoteric) reverse state monad, where values flow the normal way but state comes from the results of future computations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A monad is a monoid over a set of curried functionsI think this statement will have two kinds of readers. People who are not familiar with monads, for whom it'll fly right over their heads, and people who are familiar with monads, who will be annoyed at its inaccuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nice property of monoids is associativity, which allows for some interesting incremental algorithms, e.g. by using balanced trees: If the fold of × on a list is computed in clever way, the fold of × on a list where one element is modified can be computed in logarithmic time, given the computation of the first list.A good example for a monoid are strings with the string concatenation operation! This is used a lot in text editors. Homomorphisms are also of practical relevance here.If × is a commutative group operation (i.e. inverse elements exist and a×b=b×a), that can even be done in constant time in a trivial way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606927</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of Latin phonetics, specifically focusing on the pronunciation of Latin sounds and their historical development. It offers detailed explanations of the components of Latin pronunciation, such as vowels, consonants, and syllable structure. The content serves as a resource for students and enthusiasts of the Latin language, aiming to enhance their understanding of how Latin was spoken in its classical form.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only way I made progress in latin was when I bought a few books and started reading, beginning from (modern) children fairy tales. This actually gave me a lasting knowledge which up to this date allows me to read a simple latin text or guess a meaning of a word in English or French (neither language is native to me).Speaking latin of course takes it way further but I think the direction is the same: learn it as a living language not as as a dead one. Starting from declensions and cases gets you nowhere, judging from my friends who learned it in school for years with zero results. Instead, start using the language, if only for reading. Then you can return to grammar later if you ever want to become proficient.I also recommend this guy [1] who not only shares the same approach but apparently have fully dedicated himself to it. He has books, ebooks, audiobooks, a mobile app and a youtube podcast, all in latin. I can't cease to be impressed by the effort and the quality of the content. In comparison the Duolingo latin course is a complete disappointment.[1] https://latinitium.com/legentibus/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a pity we stopped using Latin in favour of scientific pidgin English as universal language in scientific communications.Gauss still wrote in Latin 1801, his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae are a marvel.Up until a few years back my university would still have accepted PHD thesis in Latin, they ditched it after no one had done it for almost a century.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The history of how we know what Latin sounded like is fascinating.Reminds me this video on what Shakespeare's original pronunciation sounded like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPlpphT7n9s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631959</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current SFDC software engineer - this is just cover for a widespread engineering hiring freeze since the layoffs in January 2023. There's a ton of pressure to control costs after the near shareholder revolt that caused the layoffs.The public nature of the announcement is certainly marketing for our AI offerings as well, but at this point I think most engineers are just worried there will be additional layoffs, in the event management cannibalizes product for short term stock gains again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was at Salesforce for 4 years, and during those years the company made a massive deal about:2020: the first AI craze, introducing “Einstein” as their name for their analytics platform, and officially changing the corporate vision to being the “No. 1 AI CRM company”.2021: Now it’s all about “Customer 360”, i.e. account-based marketing, i.e. what basically everyone else does without such a memeable name. You wouldn’t believe the number of slide decks I had to sit through with all our little product logos orbiting this stock art character straight out of Women Laughing While Eating Salad.2022: Never mind, now we’re betting the company on a real-time unified database called Genie, which was neither real-time nor unified (and eventually not called Genie either). Got sued for that one.2024: AGENTS. AGENTS EVERYWHERE. WE ARE AN AGENT COMPANY NOW.So, let’s see how this holds up in the face of the next hot thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part of their sales drive. We are absolutely assaulted by their sales reps trying to sell agentforce. They wine and dine non-technical executives and push the "ai agents will do everything" story. He is just reinforcing this narrative.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweet hack, thanks for sharing. I remember playing in the dark with luminous paper as a kid - If I remember correctly, I would take a hacked up disposable camera and put various objects in front of the paper before triggering the flash.I imagine that you could improve the consistency and readability some by modeling the state of each pixel of paper. That way when the drum comes around you can compensate the exposure per pixel based on the current state to achieve better uniformity of display. In this way you could do exposure compensation on each row of output to make the display equally bright top to bottom. This would be similar to how a "no-refresh" epaper display works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if you can get this where you are, but I've personally used some of these glow powders, and they get very bright: https://unitednuclear.com/glowinthedark-items-c-101_45/I've had Aqua and Green, and they look gorgeous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks cool, but if the "writing on the wall" is only supposed to be the current time, there are enough (much more mundane-looking of course) alternatives, e.g. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Emlimny-Digital-LED-Projection-Al...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633035</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses multiplicative infinitesimals within the context of non-standard analysis and their applications in mathematics. It explains the concept of infinitesimally small numbers that are greater than zero but smaller than any positive real number, detailing their properties and how they can be utilized to model mathematical phenomena. The author also examines the implications of these infinitesimals in various mathematical frameworks, including their interaction with real numbers and functions. Overall, the piece serves as a technical exploration of the theoretical underpinnings and potential uses of multiplicative infinitesimals in advanced mathematical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find infinitesimals more intuitive than the formal 'limits-based' approach. I'm currently studying my old degree material but using a fairly interesting book:"Full Frontal Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach" by Seth Braver.I like his readable style. His poetic intro finally gave me an intuition why infinitesimals might be useful, compared to the good old reals:"Yet, by developing a "calculus of infinitesimals" (as it was known for two centuries), mathematicians got great insight into `real` functions, breaking through the static algebraic ice shelf to reach a flowing world of motion below, changing and evolving in time."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm partial to Caratheodory's definition of the derivative, which avoid limits like the infinitesimal approach, but doesn't pull in all the extra baggage that come with infinitesimals (if you do it rigorously).djb (yes, that one) has a pretty good primer on it: https://cr.yp.to/papers/calculus-19970403-retypeset20220326....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, the computation involving nonstandard reals is correct (to the best of my ten-year-old memory of studying this stuff). As usual, I will recommend Goldblatt's _Lectures on the Hyperreals_ for an intro to how it all works, and Pétry's "Analyse Infinitésimale: une présentation non standard" for an undergraduate first course in analysis expressed through nonstandard analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637853</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work at a "large company", and I don't agree with most of this. Your write-up is highly subjective, and fairly pessimistic.Some people hit the ground running, and teams/organizations/companies can thrive if they find ways to embrace that. Sometimes people get hired at the wrong level, and everyone benefits if some sort of work demonstrates that quickly. I have seen promotions happen based on prudent choices around one's individual strengths, simply by choosing to do a bit of the right work and getting eyes on your capabilities. There is no "one size fits all" prescription for what someone should work on.Having a "shadow lead" can be one of the best situations for your growth, too. Not only do you get the experience leading a thing (for most of what that means, anyway), you may end up with a very strong ally when you knock it out of the park. I had a version of this experience, and I've watched others have it as well.I'm guessing most of the negatives here are based on your personal experience, and for that I'm sorry. Hopefully you can encourage positive changes in your company's engineering culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran face-first into this effect at a successful startup where I started as employee number 9.When everyone can sit around one big table, you don't have to consciously polish your "brand" all the time -- most people have direct experience with you and base their opinions on that. You do good work and you will have a good reputation. If you have a conflict with someone who is a jackass or have a project that fails to launch, people know enough about the context to judge pretty fairly.When there are hundreds of people on the engineering team, especially in a remote-heavy workforce, most people don't have direct experience with you and can only base their opinion of you on what they hear from others, i.e. your reputation. This goes for peers as much as leadership.You have to be aware of how an org changes over time, and how things that were once not important are now essential skills for success.. and decide if any new essentials are skills that you are interested in developing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems generally true in my experience.
Another aspect of this, from personal experience: while it may be easy to move around in a large organization, you risk losing reputational capital. I had a habit of building reputation in some team/platform, then after I no longer found it engaging or there was enough turnover/focus shift, I'd ask to transition to a wildly different team for a new challenge. 
It _is_ fun, but if you opt to start as an IC and work your way up, you're sorta letting the ratchet slip, and if you do it every couple years you may have broad experience, but your reputation (and likely level) will be well below where it could be.Thus, unless you can ramp to expertise really quickly to leverage your skills developed elsewhere, I'd recommend (perhaps obviously) to try to move to peripheral teams where your skills and relationships transfer as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42610021</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The provided link leads to a GitHub repository containing a C++ source code file for a benchmarking suite focused on digit counting algorithms. The code includes various functions to count the number of digits in a given number, as well as performance measurement tools to evaluate the efficiency of different counting methods.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is a cute variant that doesn't need lzcnt nor tables, but only works up to 99,999:    (((x + 393206) &amp; (x + 524188)) ^ ((x + 916504) &amp; (x + 514288))) &gt;&gt; 17

This is for integer log 10, but could be adapted for number of digits. It needs a wrapper for 64 bit to invoke it multiple times, but most numbers in a JSON are small, so it might even be competitive; it needs only 4 cycles with enough instruction level parallelism.I gathered this idea from the output of a superoptimizer, it was fun to figure out how it works. For spoilers, see [1].[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/core/s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A latency improvement would be to have digitCountThresholds be indexed by the lzcnt, instead of the result of the other LUT. Increases the size of that lookup table from 160B to 512B though. Funnily enough I've had this approach in a local copy of Ryu when I was working on cutting it down for my purposes.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses innovative ideas and concepts for programming languages that could enhance their capabilities and productivity. It emphasizes the importance of exploring novel language designs that address existing limitations and foster better software development practices. Key topics include the integration of new paradigms, improvements in syntax, and the potential for languages to better leverage modern computing hardware. By outlining various concepts, the article encourages programming language designers to think creatively and push the boundaries of what programming languages can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised these are called "programming language ideas". They seem to be solvable, at least many of them, with libraries. For example, my Haskell effect system Bluefin can be seen as a capability system for Haskell.  My database library Opaleye is basically a relational query language for Haskell.  Maybe I'm short-sighted but I haven't seen the need for a whole new language to support any of that functionality.  In fact one gets huge benefits from implementing such things in an existing language.* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bluefin* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing your thoughts.I am also agreeing that relational approach to in-memory data is a good, efffective thought.I recently compiled some of my C code with the sqlite database and I'm preparing to think how the SQL model of my standard code could be used as the actual implementation language of in memory operations.Instead of writing the hundredth loop through objects I just write a SQL query instead with joining with seeing the internal data representation of the software as an information system instead of bespoke code.I was hoping to make it possible to handle batches of data and add parallelism because arrays are useful when you want to parallelise.I was thinking, wouldn't it be good if you could write your SQL queries in advance of the software and then parse them and then compile them to C code (using an unrolled loop of the SQLite VM) so they're performant. (For example, instead of a btree for a regular system operation, you can just use a materialised array a bit like a filesystem so you're not rejoining the same data all the time)I was thinking of ways of representing actors somehow communicating by tables but I do not have anything concrete for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- Looser functions (badly chosen name)Timeouts on calls are, as the OP mentions, a thing in Erlang. Inter-process and inter-computer calls in QNX can optionally time out, and this includes all system calls that can block. Real-time programs use such features. Probably don't want it on more than that. It's like having exceptions raised in things you thought worked.- CapabilitiesThey've been tried at the hardware level, and IBM used them in the System/38, but they never caught on. They're not really compatible with C's flat memory model, which is partly they fell out of fashion.
Capabilities mean having multiple types of memory. Might come back if partially-shared multiprocessors make a comeback.- Production-Level ReleasesThat's kind of vague. Semantic versioning is a related concept. It's more of a tooling thing than a language thing.- Semi-Dynamic LanguageI once proposed this for Python. The idea was that, at some point, the program made a call that told the system "Done initializing". After that point, you couldn't load more code, and some other things that inhibit optimization would be prohibited. At that point, the JIT compiler runs, once. No need for the horrors inside PyPy which deal with cleanup when someone patches one module from another.Guido didn't like it.- Value DatabaseThe OP has a good criticism of why this is a bad idea. It's an old idea, mostly from LISP land, where early systems saved the whole LISP environment state.
Source control? What's that?- A Truly Relational LanguageWell, in Python, almost everything is a key/value store. The NoSQL people were going in that direction. Then people remembered that you want atomic transactions to keep the database from turning to junk, and mostly backed off from NoSQL where the data matters long-term.- A Language To Encourage Modular MonolithsHm. Needs further development. Yes, we still have trouble putting parts together.
There's been real progress. Nobody has to keep rewriting Vol. I of Knuth algorithms in each new project any more. But what's being proposed here?- Modular LintingThat's mostly a hack for when the original language design was botched.
View this from the point of the maintenance programmer - what guarantees apply to this code? What's been prevented from happening? Rust has one linter, and you can add directives in the code which allow exceptions. This allows future maintenance programmers to see what is being allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637304</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;EVE is a high-performance, generic C++ library designed for numerical and computational tasks, particularly focusing on expressing computations using an elegant and convenient syntax. It provides a variety of numerical types and operations, aiming to support both scalar and vectorized computations efficiently. EVE emphasizes ease of use while ensuring performance through features like automatic vectorization and interoperability with SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architectures. The library is well-suited for applications in domains such as scientific computing, machine learning, and signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting library, but i see it falls back into what happens to almost all SIMD libraries, which is that they hardcode the vector target completely and you cant mix/match feature levels within a build. The documentation recommends writing your kernels into DLLs and dynamic-loading them which is a huge mess https://jfalcou.github.io/eve/multiarch.htmlMeanwhile xsimd (https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd) has the feature level as a template parameter on its vector objects, which lets you branch at runtime between simd levels as you wish. I find its a far better way of doing things if you actually want to ship the simd code to users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This library's eve::soa_vector is the first attempt I've seen at dealing with the "SOA problem," which is that if you write good, parallel-friendly code, all your types go to hell and never come back because the language can't express concepts like "my object is made from element 7 of each of these 6 pointers." Instead you write really FORTRAN-looking array processing code with no types or methods in sight.Does anyone know of other libraries that help a C++ programmer deal with struct-of-arrays?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EVE is personally my favorite SIMD library in any programming language. It's the only one I've tried that provides masked lane operations in a declarative style, aside from SPMD languages like CUDA or OpenMP. The [] syntax for that is admittedly pretty exotic C++, but I think the usefulness of the feature is worth it. I wish the documentation was better, though. When I first started, I struggled to figure out how to simply make a 4-lane float vector that I can pass into shaders, because almost all of the examples are written for the "wide" native-SIMD size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42603188</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciated this. Lots of solid advice and positive and pragmatic thinking here about aging in the context of being a programmer, and more generally too.I'll take this opportunity to make a related pitch regarding back pain in particular, which can become more of a problem if you are sedentary as so many programmers are: if you have chronic back issues you owe it to yourself to at least check out Stuart McGill's Back Mechanic (https://www.backfitpro.com/books/back-mechanic-the-mcgill-me...). It's very much in line with this post; in particular the idea that you just have to deal with back pain as a fact of life is--for most people--not the case. Please take a look if you are struggling with back pain. The process he lays out takes work but it's based on solid research and experience and it has helped me tremendously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slides:https://github.com/CppNorth/CppNorth_Slides/blob/main/2024/K...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is some good advice, but the way she assumes old people have a lot of money, costs go down because of accumulation of assetes and salaries rise faster than inflation, might not be transferable to everyone in all geographies and generations (only read the slides)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632772</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never noticed this until scrolling through this image gallery, but the design of these ads consistently and prominently highlights the first letters of "More Doctors," which was almost certainly intended to visually reinforce the M.D. association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is interesting that these ads are particularly targeted at women - maybe I am looking too much in to it, but I would guess there was (is) a big gender disparity with tobacco health concerns. These ads are quite different from the Marlboro Man - "tough cigarettes for tough men."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An excerpt from _How to Lie with Statistics_ by Darrell Huff (1954):&gt; Take this one: "27 percent of a large sample of eminent physicians smoke Throaties--more than any other brand." The figure itself may be phony, of course, in any of several ways, but that really doesn't make any difference. The only answer to a figure so irrelevant is "So what?" With all proper respect toward the medical profession, do doctors know any more about tobacco brands than you do? Do they have any inside information that permits them to choose the least harmful among cigarettes? Of course they don't, and your doctor would be the first to say so. Yet that "27 percent" somehow manages to sound as if it meant something.That book specifies many other examples (from this time period in America) of misleading claims that sound statistically significant upon an uncritical, cursory reading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42620720</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Facebook has been censoring stories from 404 Media that focus on the platform's censorship practices. It highlights instances where 404 Media's posts were flagged or removed, raising concerns about freedom of expression and the implications of social media platforms controlling information. The piece argues that such actions not only undermine journalistic integrity but also restrict public discourse around crucial issues of censorship and media accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

Then a magic thing happened: facebook posts that linked to our publication started disappearing within a minute of publication. Including journalists and newspapers. Then posts about how the posts were removed started disappearing. Then facebook accounts - including journalists - writing about this were banned.Sounds like a fairy tale, but it actually happened [2]. I suspect a human overreaction and then automated systems taking over. Anyway, eventually it was escalated really high up and resolved. I can't share any more details unfortunately, even though I'd like to write more about this.[1] English translation: https://cert.pl/en/posts/2024/12/Ad-fraud-on-large-online-pl...[2] Our reaction post about this, in Polish: https://cert.pl/posts/2024/11/blokada-na-meta-stanowisko/.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure about ads, but things are definitely getting worse in terms of health first at FB and now at Instagram. It seems like sex workers (onlyfans models) seemed to have realized the way to skirt the FB community guidelines. There’s no straight porn, but when cooking videos and reels about cute animals suddenly starts morphing into cooking videos but with someone wearing suggestive clothes and animal videos centered around an attractive person doing suggestive things, things go downhill real fast.Recommendation takes higher precedence over your network. And then nefarious actors take over the recommendations. That’s how these products die. The recommendation engine is unfortunately not able to distinguish between regular content and suggestive content, and no amount of reporting/blocking seems to change that. Plus almost all the reports are reviewed and are determined to have not broken any community rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637267</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "On the Non-uniqueness of the Solution to the Problem of Evolutionary Games on Networks" discusses the complexities and non-uniqueness of solutions in evolutionary game theory when applied to networked systems. It critiques the traditional approaches that assume unique solutions and explores how various configurations and interactions in networks can lead to multiple, distinct equilibrium states. The authors aim to highlight the importance of network structure in shaping evolutionary outcomes and urge for a broader understanding of these dynamics in both theoretical and practical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

I find the claim that this represents partial progress slightly misleading, but interesting nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasn't there a paper from Heidi Howard that stated you it's not actually f failures in 2f+1 nodes, but you can actually make the number of nodes that can fail a lot higher, if you have some nodes that have to take part in the quorum (or the prior proposal)? This feels roughly similar?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602347</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of autocorrection features in digital keyboards on writing and communication. It highlights how autocorrection aims to enhance typing efficiency and accuracy, but can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or frustration due to unintended word substitutions and context issues. The author emphasizes the need for users to be aware of these potential pitfalls and adapt their writing habits accordingly. Additionally, the piece examines the balance between relying on technology for assistance and maintaining personal writing style.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It runs on your keyboard, so it is always active no matter what software.I like the idea, but wouldn't that get annoying in contexts where you don't want it? My text editor already annoys me with auto-correct, I'm not sure I want even more of it! Ideally, I think this would be an OS-level feature, but one that only targets specific contexts (e.g. 'rich text' fields, not 'plain text' ones; configurable at an app level).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such ideas generally interfere with usability. I loath any such automations. Some more examples: the menu changes when the mouse hovers over the item; the window size or position changes when the window movement nears the border; Word automatically indent bullet items etc etc. The people designing such systems think they are designing a smart system and the usability is horrible, for me at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cute and clever idea. There's even overriding autocorrect (hit and release Ctrl before the last letter triggering the autocorrect).But while principially possible even in the restricted environment of keyboard hardware it is questionable whether it's a good idea after all. It's not a lot more than a toy, especially because the dictionary is limited and hardcoded.I respect and acknowledge the ingenuity. It must have been a lot of fun to get this working for Pascal Getreuer. Kudos!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611971</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses browser hooks, primarily focusing on their role in web security and the challenges they pose. It explains how hooks can be used to manipulate the behavior of browsers and the potential risks they present, such as data leakage and performance issues. The author reviews various types of hooks, including those related to HTTP requests and the DOM, and emphasizes the importance of understanding their implications in the context of user privacy and web application security. Overall, the piece highlights the need for developers and users to be aware of browser hooks and their possible vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; this is probably a mitigating control which would make exploit development much harder in case an exploit chain attempted to leverage one of those RWX areas for executionThis didn't pass the sniff test for me - this doesn't do anything to protect existing RWX regions, and a theoretical attacker that has the ability to inject arbitrary DLLs into the browser process already has access far beyond what the browser could protect.Fortunately, because the browser in question (Firefox) is open source, we can find the change that added this code. This is a bit of a pain because the file has been renamed twice, but here it is: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7d2e74c69253e57fd...And if we read the associated bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1322554) we can see this is described as "policy decision", and this entire section of the code isn't exploit mitigation, but rather intended to block broken third party programs from injecting their buggy and poorly written DLLs into Firefox and causing bugs that users report to Mozilla.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The browser is Firefox, and I'm the engineer (no longer at Mozilla) who spearheaded the development of this. AMA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While security software and antivirus deserve all the injection blocking they may get, we must also consider how to bypass these mechanism when it's about reenabling adblocking by injecting DLLs in the browser for request blocking etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601013</guid></item><item><title>39.

I emigrated to the U.S. in 2022 but left after a year. Life is plenty hard for citizens there, and despite working in tech, I constantly had this fear of needing healthcare in the back of my mind.I didn’t want to risk bankruptcy because of an insurance denial, so I left quickly. Aside from the dismal state of transportation, unwalkable cities, and a self-sabotaging healthcare system, I actually kind of enjoyed my time there. Now living in Europe, I’m poorer but happier too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; if we knew about it, then we have to ask: ‘Where are the regulators?

&lt;p&gt;Valve's SteamOS is expanding beyond the Steam Deck, signaling a shift for Windows gaming as it becomes available on various hardware configurations. This move aims to create a more inclusive and accessible gaming ecosystem, allowing players to enjoy Steam games without being tied to Windows. The article discusses the implications of this expansion for both developers and gamers, as well as the potential challenges and opportunities in the game industry landscape as it adapts to this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a console gamer for a long, long time just because I refuse to use Microsoft products, and Linux gaming was fraught except for Battle for Wesnoth and Nethack. Many hours just messing with Wine vs I turn on the machine and the game just starts, no fuss.I've owned a Steam Deck not quite since day 1, I'm beyond delighted now that I can just buy and play Steam games. I think I've thrown maybe one game at Proton that I just couldn't get working. And things like the Heroic launcher have made GoG games (most of which already ran on Linux since they just run via DOSBox) easier than ever.Anyone on the fence about keeping Windows around just for games: unless you play online multiplayer that uses kernel anti-cheat, just make the jump. I promise you, almost every game in your library will just work, and almost all of the rest will work after you set them to run with a specific Proton version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I bought an Asus Rog Ally X on a recent trip to NYC (i'm not from the US, and the steam deck isn't sold on regular retailers).I can't believe how awful the user interface is, they are bascially installing windows 11 in a computer shaped as a portable console, with really small icons and imprecise touch controls, onedrive and microsoft 365 offers, crazy.If you can install Steam OS on it, all those consolized PCs will end up using native Steam OS, and the next step is the living room (console like desktop pcs).Microsoft must be really thinking about an Xbox OS, or at least a native and usable gaming interface for windows 11. Valve is trying to remove microsoft as a dependency for their bussines. And i think microsoft sees valve as it's bigger competitor on the gaming space, not Playstation as everyone thinks, that's why they are going with the "everything is an Xbox" ads and rumors about "third party xboxes".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I very rarely play games, and for long time I had dedicated windows installation just for steam and friends.This was always annoying experience to reboot, hunt for grub, then half year of windows updates until I was able to enjoy my free time.But thanks to proton, I don't remember anymore when was last time I had to do that, everything just works great on Linux ootb including titles like cyberpunk.For people wanting dedicated (console like) gaming machine steam os looks really promising.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633269</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long ago, I decided to embed a scheme in C++ when I was building a game (nothing AAA or fancy; just a RPG mixed with shmup I wanted to make since I was a kid); when I succeeded, I noticed I never touched the C++ again. So then wondered why I used C++ in the first place and went full for Chezscheme, which is very fast anyway and fast enough for most things. It is fun though. I found the Python case a better fit; it was (is) so slow that actually it makes sense to implement critical path code in C/++.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare to steel? https://github.com/mattwparas/steel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632592</guid></item><item><title>45.

  ``The wonderful thing about Unix standards is that there are so many to choose from.'' You may be totally bewildered about the multitude of various standards that exist. Rest assured that nowhere in this manual will you encounter an attempt to spell it all out for you; you could not read and internalise such a twisted account without bleeding from the nose and ears.

  However, you might keep in mind the following simple fact: of all the standards, POSIX is the least common denominator. So when this manual repeatedly refers to POSIX, the point is ``the thing we are describing should be portable just about anywhere.'' Scsh sticks to POSIX when at all possible; its major departure is symbolic links, which aren't in POSIX (see -- it really is a least common denominator).

I often get nostalgic for the old days, but it could be pretty terrible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previously:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21668685https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21668685&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632308</guid></item><item><title>46.

For most people around the world it's not a cheap trip, riding there might be something they've dreamt about for years, and they intend to make every minute count, even though they're tired and some of the trails are unlike anything they've ever ridden at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This tracks with my own bias as an ER doc. I do feel that the risk of c-spine injuries from mountain biking is understated. As they said in the article, you are especially vulnerable to a hangmans fracture when thrown over the handlebars. I wonder if the ergonomics or geometry of a bicycle could be modified to better protect a rider’s neck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mountain biking needs to be split into two.There is casual off-roading on a mountain bike and there is the dare devil downhill stuff. Very different risk profiles in my mind&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632878</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting that there was a port of Speedscript to the VIC-20. That was a word processor originally published in Compute! magazine and ported to most 6502-based computers (and MS-DOS, but that was a rewrite in Turbo Pascal as the original was in 6502 assembly language). That probably would have been the best option for the VIC-20 -- Speedscript was a pretty amazing program for something published in a magazine and was better than many word processors for sale in the 1980s.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love retro computing and have used retro systems for contemporary work. This said, the VIC 20 has a horrendous font that I couldn't handle even back in the day. I think DOS with the standard PC font is vastly superior for retro word processing (especially with WordPerfect!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's topic drift, but referencing WP software from that era always reminds me of my OWN experience then.In junior high and high school, my computer was a TRS-80 Color Computer II. We did not have a floppy drive; we used a cassette player instead. SOME software -- games, mostly -- was available on cassette, too, but my word processor was on a cartridge, like an Atari game.This was, at the time, my first and only exposure to word processing software.Then, in my junior year of high school (86-87), I was on the annual staff, and we had an IBM PCjr in the office for our use. It had dual floppies -- the height of luxury, or so I thought.Imagine my shock and dismay when I found that performance in the word processor (moving between modes, say) was AGONIZINGLY SLOW compared to my much-less-fancy TRS-80. See, the word proc on the PC was on a floppy, and so reading other bits of the program meant hitting that fairly slow bus. At home, though, it was on a ROM slotted into the main board, and so everything within the program was basically instant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42621033</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article describes the concept of a pool allocator, a memory management technique that improves efficiency by allocating a block of memory for multiple objects of the same type, rather than allocating and freeing individual objects. It explains the advantages of using a pool allocator, such as reduced fragmentation and faster allocation times, especially in scenarios with frequent object creation and destruction. The text also covers how a pool allocator can be implemented, detailing strategies for managing free and used memory blocks, and provides coding examples to illustrate the implementation process. Overall, it aims to provide readers with a clear understanding of pool allocators and their practical benefits in programming.&lt;/p&gt;

Hanson's book (written in the 'literary programming' style invented by Donal Knuth) also demonstrates having debugging and production implementations for the same C API to catch memory errors, and his book is from 1997:  &gt; Copyright © 1997 by David R.

(He used to be a SE professor I Princeton before getting hired by Microsoft, I believe.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you write your own allocator in C, do yourself a favor and use the valgrind API inside it. Its use can be conditional so you can "compile it out". Or should I say it has to be, so you can build the code in an environment where there's no valgrind API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One aspect people don't tend to mention (and TFA does not because it has "general purpose" as a scope) about doing your own allocation arenas is that because a "pointer" is just the name (really number) of an allocated region, this also affords flexibility in the width of those numbers aka "pointer size" that decides your "address" space.So, for example, if you are willing to limit yourself to 64 KiNodes of equal sized objects, a pool like https://github.com/c-blake/bst/blob/main/POOL.c can use an unsigned short 2-byte pointer.  This small address space specialization can give a full 4x space overhead optimization over modern 64-bit pointers.You could even use 8x less with 1-byte pointers if 256 nodes is enough or use bit fields or equivalents for even more fine-grained address space size selection.  Admittedly, linked structures are usually less interesting for very small address space sizes, but this is sometimes useful.  People may complain about arbitrary limits that relate to this kind of optimization, but the linked part could be "small by design" without compromising overall scale { such as for structure within a B-tree node or other multi-level indexing setups }.In any event, I think it is useful to highlight pointer size arbitrariness to junior engineers.  It is often learned once &amp; immediately forgotten behind an onslaught of general purpose-ness (&amp; pointer type systems/syntax).  Relocation ideas also relate.  E.g., if all the pointers are implicitly indices into a (small?) array, and all the code needs a "base address" of that array to get a VMem address, then you can relocate the whole bundle of objects pretty easily changing only the base address.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42605848</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing.I did a similar thing for the game Highfleet, until I ran into roadblocks with the dev team.My ultimate goal was to have a "print poster" button that would generate the image and ship it off to one of those poster drop-shippers for a small fee. In that game, you can annotate the maps, and the world map with battle annotations is really special with lots of memories of victories and defeats. Alas, no dice.I suggest you do this for blueprints! The first thing I'm going to do is take my favorite space platforms and outposts and make posters - the colored block imagery is really artful.And, if you want a real challenge, you could parse the end-game uploads (galaxy) if available, or save files themselves.Or, slightly less ambitious - a game mod that generates links to this site directly.Very nicely done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if you could add in the production / consumption rates of various machines into this and have the visualizer show bottlenecks and other data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thank you for the artistic contribution to the factorio community! So much stuff around this game is ruthless efficiency it's very nice to have something with some style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644168</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks awesome.What I would love to see either as something leveraging this, or built in to this, is if you prompt stagehand to extract data from a page, it also returns the xpath elements you'd use to re-scrape the page without having to use an LLM to do that second scraping.So basically, you can scrape new pages never before seen with the non-deterministic LLM tool, and then when you need to rescrape the page again to update content for example, you can use the cheaper old-school scraping method.Not sure how brittle this would be both going from LLM version to xcode version reliably, or how to fallback to the LLM version if your xcode script fails, but overall conceptually, being able to scrape using the smart tools but then building up basically a library of dumb scraping scripts over time would be killer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks very cool and makes a lot of sense, except for the idea that it should take the place of Playwright et al.Personally I'd love to use this as an intermediate workflow for producing deterministic playwright code, but it looks like this is intended for running directly.I don't think I could plausibly argue for using LLMs at runtime in our test suite at work...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks really cool, thanks for sharing!I recently tried to implement a workflow automation using similar frameworks that were playwright or puppeteer based. My goal was to log into a bunch of vendor backends and extract values for reporting (no APIs available). What stopped me entirely were websites that implemented an invisible captcha. They can detect a playwright instance by how it interacts with the DOM. Pretty frustrating, but I can totally see this becoming a standard as crawling and scraping is getting out of control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "WorstFit: Unveiling Hidden Transformers in Windows ANSI" explores a unique approach to understanding and optimizing the performance of hidden transformers within the Windows ANSI system. It delves into the concept of "Worst Fit," a method for resource allocation that contrasts with traditional strategies, shedding light on its potential benefits and applications. The author discusses technical intricacies, implementation details, and the implications of these findings for improving efficiency in computational tasks. Overall, the piece aims to enhance comprehension of transformer architecture in the context of Windows environments, promoting innovative thinking in resource management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a tough one. It’s systemic —- MS provides a “best fit” code mapping from wide Unicode to ASCII, which is a known, published, “vibes-based” mapper. This best fit parser is used a lottt of places, and I’m sure that it’s required for ongoing inclusion based on how MS views backward compatibility. It’s linked in by default everywhere, whether or not you know you included it.The exploits largely revolved around either speccing an unusual code point that “vibes” into say a slash or a hyphen or quotes. These code points are typically evaluated one way (correct full Unicode evaluation) inside a modern programming language, but when passed to shell commands or other Win32 API things are vibes-downed. Crucially this happens after you check them, since it’s when you’ve passed control.To quote the curl maintainer “curl is a victim” here — but who is the culprit? It seems certain that curl will be used to retrieve user supplied data automatically by a server in the future. When that server mangles user input in one way for validation and another when applied to system libraries, you’re going to have a problem.It seems to me like maybe the solution is to provide an opt-out of “best fit” munging in the Win32 space, but I’m not a Windows guy, so I speculate. At least then open source providers could just add the opt out to best practices, and deal with the many terrible problems that things like a Unicode wide variant of “ or \ delivers to them.And of course even if you do that, you’ll interact with officially shipped APIs and software that has not opted out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is kind of unsurprising, but still new to me even as someone who did Windows development (and some Wine API hacking) for a decade around when this W/A mess came about.Windows is like the card game Munchkin, where a whole bunch of features can add up to a completely, unbelievably random over-powered exploit because of unintentional synergy between random bits.I'm happy to see that they are converting the ANSI subsystem to UTF-8, which should, in theory, mitigate a lot of these problems.I wonder if the Rust team is going to need YetAnotherFix to the process spawning API to fix this...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; until Microsoft chooses to enable UTF-8 by default in all of their Windows editions.I don’t know how likely this is. There are a lot of old applications that assume a particular code page, or assume 1 byte per character, that this would break. There are also more subtle variations of this, like applications assuming that converting from wide characters to ANSI can’t increase the number of bytes (and hence an existing buffer can be safely reused), which isn’t the case for UTF-8 (but for all, or almost all, existing code pages). It can open up new vulnerabilities.It would probably cause much less breakage to remove the Best-Fit logic from the win32 xxxA APIs, and instead have all unmappable characters be replaced by a character without any common meta semantics, like “x”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647101</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive demonstration of particle systems, showcasing how particles behave and interact within a simulated environment. Users can manipulate various parameters such as the number of particles, their speed, and other properties to visualize different effects. This resource serves as an educational tool to help users understand the principles of particle dynamics and computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

This is just a simple demo for my educational programming language Easylang. You can easily edit the code and increase the particle count for example. In the IDE you can then create a link with the code embedded in the URL.https://tiki.li/run/#cod=dVLNbsIwDL7nKT5p0gRDdEGMA9PYM+yO0FT...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built a similar thing that includes forces between particles meant to simulate a sort of fluid or, as you scroll down, a gelatinous solid. There’s a bit of free energy injected to keep things moving so it’s actually a very bad fluid sim, but I think that makes it a better interactive toy in exchange.One of the fun parts of naively n^2 particle simulations is trying to find ways to reduce the algorithmic complexity of collision detection. I remember messing with sweep lines and similar, though I don’t remember what optimizations made it into the final code. [0][0] https://omrelli.ug&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to share mine as well. There's a bit of more interaction between particles but I don't remember the exact logic. Code should be easy to read:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is always an origin to writing something (or aptly, a citation.)"I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."- Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; More and more, the sentences I had in my head were like the sentences I loved in books: they began in one place and ended somewhere you hadn’t imagined them going, though, at each turn, idea seemed to follow idea perfectly naturally. The surprise at the end, as the thought completed itself, seemed wildly exciting: the whole sentence needed to be reëxperienced in this light; waves of unexpected revelations and insights resulted.Verlyn Klinkenborg, author of Several Short Sentences About Writing, calls these “volunteer sentences.” You don’t follow them, you tame them. Take control of your writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing is an interesting process, it seems different for everyone. There are lots of tools and techniques so that is not a surprise.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I particularly like this part from the final thoughts:"solicitation is one of the first and most common signs of a scam these days"This is true about most scams these days. So much so that I have been advising non-technical friends and family to stop directly responding to any communication you did not initiate. Instead ask yourself, "how would I go about addressing or confirming this with the supposed source if I hadn't received a message about it?" Also helps with avoiding the encouragement of marketers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen an increase in both warnings about these kinds of scams and cautionary tales by those who've been burned. I'm glad people are raising awareness, but I worry that this is just one more datapoint toward the overall erosion of online trust.It seems like the only way to really combat this is through closed / semi-closed trusted networks, but those tend to become dominated by personalities and difficult for newcomers to break into. The reduced trust in "outside" voices then leads to echo chambers and groupthink. I think we're already starting to see some of this in the kinds of books being put out by the big publishing houses; I don't have hard numbers (and maybe I'm just getting old and cynical) but a lot of recent titles feel extremely generic.There's a subplot in Neil Stephenson's Fall (or Dodge in Hell) where media and other networks are so saturated with false, meaningless, clickbaity, or otherwise negative-value content that they become either less than worthless, or require paid "filters" to extract actual value. I'm getting a sense of being close to that point already and I don't know what the right move is from here to reduce the fracturing of my wider social circles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pretty much the only things that are really important are the last two points&gt;A real agency is highly unlikely to email or phone you out of the blue with an offer of representation or a claim that a traditional publisher is interested in your work (real agents don’t pre-shop manuscripts for authors they don’t represent).&gt;A real agency will not require you to pay anything or buy anything as a condition of representation or publication. Other than the agent’s commission, there should never be a cost associated with rights acquisition.highly unlikely is politespeak for never going to happen unless your self published work is making tens of thousands of sales already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611126</guid></item><item><title>11.

I've moderated against him on a Stack Exchange site before and it's tedious how far he can push the limits. He knows the rules, the process, what's expected, and he knows how lowly moderators react when they the system alerts them to infractions. It's no surprise he's earned himself [another] suspension here.But as a moderator, what the company is doing here is ridiculous and a seemingly flagrant abuse of license. If you take contributions under CC-BY-SA, you damned-well keep the attribution unless the contributor wants to be disassociated from it. If you don't want to be associated with a contributor, delete the account, and the content.You can't pick and choose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course, people, whether criminals or not, should be attributed for their intellectual contributions but there is a bigger point here which people do not say enough:The criminal justice system already wields the responsibility of punishing criminals. Let the convicts go through due process and do their time. The rest of the society should not participate in "delivering justice": obviously not by hitting them or torturing them, but also not by taking away their property or social capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, my ex co-worker who has been convicted of murder and is serving life without possibility of parole has his account untouched [0]. It's surprising because his case was all over the news and tabloids.Not so Fun fact: a second coworker, from the same company, different crime, has also been convicted and is serving 14 years.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got one of these too. When I was 6 or 7 I read a book in the school library in which the villains were the "bone people" and the heroes were space explorers. The bone people could read minds, so they could tell everything the heroes were planning and thwart them.Eventually the heroes learn to keep their true thoughts in the back of their minds, where the bone people can't access them, and with this technique they eventually defeat the bone people. It was the best book I'd ever read (up till then!) and I remember practicing keeping my thoughts in the back of my mind.I've been trying for years to find this book again. Anybody have ideas?Edit: it occurred to me that I should try an LLM, so I pasted the above text into O1 and, in a combination of anticlimactic and thrilling, it gave the answer straightaway. The book is https://www.amazon.com/Bone-People-Space-Science-Fiction/dp/... and the title is, er, "Bone People".

But it produced an opposite result in my case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a wonderful story. I've also had an experience of someone in a writing community being able to name a story I read in my youth, it is really a unique feeling to have a distant hazy memory made real due to the wisdom of another. It's a similar feeling to finding the perfect word for an uncertain feeling you've never been able to give voice to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidenote: David Allen Green, the author of this blog,  is a brilliant writer on constitutional law in the UK. It is quite a subject since Britain doesn't have a written constitution.

On average, after running for just 16 hours, it must be offlined for 8 hours to run maintenance tasks such as "scrub", "garbage collect", "trim", and "fsck".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little over a year ago I was having awful sleep hygiene. From time to time, I still wake up at ~2am and just can't find restfulness again.I picked up a simple smart watch that tracks sleep (one of the Garmins, as they are one of the few that protect privacy and don't need to connect to the Internet). I slowly and methodically improved my sleep, and I feel like a different person.I have noticed that if I turn my blue light filter on my screens off, that has a huge impact. Working long days has a huge impact. I take a hell of a lot of magnesium. I need ~20 minutes of outdoor walking a day and I need to eat dinner before 4pm. Lots of other small things that have an impact that I'm probably forgetting.How many of us are just chronically tired?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644204</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Hack Club is a global community and network for student-led coding clubs, aiming to empower high school students to learn programming and develop their creative projects. The platform provides resources, tools, and support to help students start and grow their own coding clubs, connect with peers, and collaborate on projects. It encourages hands-on learning through workshops, hackathons, and a vibrant community where students can share their work, seek advice, and inspire each other. The goal is to cultivate a passion for coding and technology among young learners.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently supervised a Hackclub Counterspell event at our office. I was there only in the capacity of being an adult in the room, for health and safety and safeguarding reasons.The entire event had been organised by a single teenager, with mini workshops, hack time and a global show and tell.Kids that attended were not only coders, but musicians and artists as well.The whole event was amazing, with more pizza than I thought it possible to eat.The kids produced some genuinely interesting games, learned some new skills, and had a great time socially.I fully intend to support more events in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HackClub is great. I feel like I aged out of their target demographics recently though.I can share my single and very positive experience with them.
In summer 2020 (I was 18 then), they were going to host/sponsor some hackathons (IIRC), but because of Covid they couldn’t do that so instead they gave away that money to students who had some project idea. If your project was accepted you got $100 for it - but you had to share the result with the community.I applied and got that 100, and used it to make a remote-controlled mobility scooter [0] with my friend. Not the most useful thing in the world but it was ton of fun![0]: https://youtu.be/WWUe42dH6nw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw the Hack Club presentation at the Ubuntu Summit 2024 ("How 30K teenagers build open source software") and it was an unexpected highlight of the conference for me. I'd expected it to be a boring kids program, but Hack Club looks very cool! https://youtu.be/AdgU-_1vDco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611282</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advancements in generative modeling, specifically focusing on improving the training dynamics and performance of diffusion models. It evaluates techniques that enhance the efficiency and stability of these models during the training process, leading to better performance in generating high-quality samples. The authors present a series of experiments demonstrating these improvements and offer insights into how these methods can be applied in various applications of generative modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related but here's my take on super intelligence or AGI. I have worked with CNN,GNN and other old school AI methods, but don't have the resources to build a real SOT LLM, but I do use and tinker with LLM's occasionally.If AGI or SI(super intelligence)/is possible, and that is an if...I don't think LLM's are going to be this silver bullet solution Just as we have in the real world of people who are dedicated to a single task in their field like a lawyer or construction workers or doctors and brain surgeons, I see the current best path forward as being a "mixture of experts". We know LLM's are pretty good for what iv seen some refer to as NLP problems, where the model input is the tokenized string input.  However I would argue an LLM will never built a trained model like stockfish or deepseek.  Certain model types seem to be suited to certain issues/types of problems or inputs.  True AGI or SI would stop trying to be a grand master of everything but rather know what best method/model should be applied to a given problem.  We still do not know if it is possible to combine the knowledge of different types of neural networks like LLMs, convolutional neural networks, and deep learning...and while its certainly worth exploring, it is foolish to throw all hope on a single solution approach. I think the first step would be to create a new type of model where given a problem of any type. It knows the best method to solve it. And it doesn't rely on itself but rather the mixture of agents or experts. And they don't even have to be LLMs. They could be anything.Where this really would explode is, if the AI was able to identify a problem that it can't solve and invent or come up with a new approach, multiple approaches, because we don't have to be the ones who develop every expert.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO, the word agent is quickly becoming meaningless. 
The amount of agency that sits with the program vs. the user is something that changes gradually.So we should think about these things in terms of how much agency are we willing to give away in each case and for what gain[1].Then the ecosystem question that the paper is trying to solve will actually solve itself, because it is already the case today that in many processes agency has been outsourced almost fully and in others - not at all. I posit that this will continue, just expect a big change of ratios and types of actions.[1] https://essays.georgestrakhov.com/artificial-agency-ladder/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I just don’t understand the article but I really have 0 clue how they go about making their conclusions and really don’t understand what they are saying.I think the 5 issues they provide under “Cognitive Architectures” are severely underspecified to the point where they really don’t _mean_ anything. Because the issues are so underspeficifed I don’t know how their proposed solution solves their proposed problems. If I understand it correctly, they just want agents (Assistants/Agents) with user profiles (Sims) on an app store? I’m pretty sure this already exists on the ChatGPT store. (sims==memories/user profiles, agents==tools/plugins, assistants==chat interface)This whole thing is so broad and full of academic (pejorative) platitudes that it’s practically meaningless to me. And of course although completely unrelated they through a reference into symbolic systems. Academic theater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611099</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the White House's introduction of a Cyber Trust Mark program aimed at enhancing consumer confidence in the cybersecurity of internet-connected devices. This initiative, announced in early 2025, seeks to create a standardized label to identify devices that meet specific security requirements, thereby helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The program is part of broader efforts to strengthen national cybersecurity by encouraging manufacturers to adopt tighter security measures for their products, addressing the increasing concerns over cyber threats and vulnerabilities associated with smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I'm not sure if the public comment period is over (The original proposal is dated August, 2023), but this stands out to me from their paper:    We propose to focus the scope of our program on intentional radiators that generate and emit RF energy by radiation or induction.31 Such devices – if exploited by a vulnerability – could be manipulated to generate and emit RF energy to cause harmful interference. While we observe that any IoT device may emit RF energy (whether intentionally, incidentally, or unintentionally), in the case of incidental and unintentional radiators, the RF energy emitted because of exploitation may not be enough to be likely to cause harmful interference to radio transmissions.

I guess it is the FCC so this makes sense from their point of view. From my perspective, I'd like to see marks indicating:* If the devices can be pointed to an alternate API provider if the company stops supporting* If firmware has been escrowed / will be made available if the company stops supporting* If device data is stored by the company* If that data is certified as end to end encrypted* Some marks for who / how the data is used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool, I'd rather have a stamp that indicates a company will support their product for X number of years, and if they don't, they will release the software as OSS so you can maintain yourself. I have an extremely expensive scale that came with wifi support and an app, only bought it 3 years ago, half the features already don't work because they nuked the app and stopped supporting the scale. did I need a smart scale? Absolutely not, and I don't really need any other "smart" devices the more I think about stuff like this, and now seek to buy "stupid" devices as much as possible. I'm not sure what such security stamps are supposed to provide other than false sense of security, as most things can be hacked eventually with enough determination or someone unknown zero day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a bit scary. Knowing how software is developed, I know there's no government program that could actually ensure a device is secure. It's one thing to measure an electronic device's EMI or pump it full of power and see if it catches fire. But black box testing of software is itself a black art, as software security is a lot more complex than [typical] electronic design.The scary bit is that this label is going to be found to be ineffective, and then consumers may lose trust in government-issued safety stamps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42636675</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how consumers can avoid the recent price increase for Microsoft 365 subscriptions by exploring alternative options and strategies. It emphasizes that users can downgrade their current plans, switch to a family plan to save costs, or consider other similar productivity tools that may offer better value. Additionally, it encourages users to be proactive in managing their subscriptions and advocates for consumer rights regarding pricing changes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel that convincing people to pay monthly/yearly for something that has minimal monthly recurring expenditure/investment from the provider (unlike utilities, streaming services, etc.) is one of the biggest cons of the modern era.I have Office 2010 on an old computer. While it lacks some modern features of Microsoft 365 (for example, Office 2010 is much, much faster), it still works seamlessly with any files I create in 365. And I only had to pay, once, about the same amount that Microsoft is charging for a year's use of the same suite in the present day.So they throw in a few gigs of OneDrive to supposedly justify the cost? That vendor lock-in is obviously part of the con (see for instance the complete and very deliberate lack of portability of documents created in OneNote, if you don't have the Professional/Enterprise version). And there are innumerable better services out there, many of which are even free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those unaware, if you want to use the latest Office Suite (2024), but don’t want to pay a monthly fee, Microsoft still offers a one time purchase [0] for $149.99 which is now cheaper than the (new) one year subscription (with no cloud storage of course).[0] https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/office-home-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it increasingly hard to justify any sort of SaaS subscription these days.  Is the value you get out of Microsoft 365 really that much greater than any of the open source alternatives?  So much better that you let a corporation dictate the terms of your computing environment?It honestly makes me angry.  And I say that as someone who works in the industry for a SaaS company.  The only SaaS I reluctantly pay for is Fastmail and that's only because it's basically impossible to host your own email these days if you care about your email actually getting delivered to all those Gmail and Outlook inboxes out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640180</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the history of Britain's first internet connection, which was established through the efforts of late pioneer Peter Kirstein in the 1970s. It highlights Kirstein's significant contributions, including the creation of the first password on the internet and his role in connecting the UK to ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. The piece emphasizes the importance of these early technological advancements and their impact on the development of global internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That March 1977 map always brings back a flood of memories to this old-timer.Happy nights spent hacking in the Harvard graduate computer center next to the PDP-1/PDP-10 (Harv-1, Harv-10), getting calls on the IMP phone in the middle of the night from the BBN network operations asking me to reboot it manually as it had gotten wedged...And, next to me, Bill Gates writing his first assembler/linker/simulator for the Altair 8080... (I tried talking him out of this microcomputer distraction -- we have the whole world of mainframes at our fingertips! -- without success.)(Edit:) We also would play the game of telnet-till-you-die, going from machine to machine around the world (no passwords on guest accounts in the early days), until the connection died somewhere along the way.Plus, once the hackers came along, Geoff Steckel (systems guy on the PDP-10) wrote a little logger to record all incoming guests keystrokes on an old teletype, so we could watch them attempting to hack the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked for Peter Kirstein for many years - he always had wonderful stories to tell.In the article Peter talks about the temporary import license for the original ARPAnet equipment.  The delayed VAT and duty bill for this gear prevented anyone else taking over the UK internet in the early days because the bill would have then become due.  But he didn't mention that eventually if the original ARPAnet equipment was ever scrapped, the bill would also become due.When I was first at UCL in the mid 1980s until well into the 90s, all that equipment was stored disused in the mens toilets in the basement.  Eventually Peter decided someone had to do something about it, but he couldn't afford the budget to ship all this gear back to the US.  Peter always seemed to delight in finding loopholes, so he pulled some strings.  Peter was always very well connected - UCL even ran the .int and nato.int domains for a long time.  So, at some point someone from UCL drove a truck full of obsolete ARPAnet gear to some American Air Force base in East Anglia that was technically US territory.   Someone from the US air force gave them a receipt, and the gear was officially exported.  And there it was left, in the US Air Force garbage.  Shame it didn't end up in a museum, but that would have required paying the VAT bill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trouble was that it was quite unclear to a researcher, even in one of the research council networking hubs, how to get access to the gateway, and it may have cost.  I gave up trying before going to work in Oak Ridge for the summer (where I was taken aback by the primitive computing, at least "outside the fence").  For some time (mid-80s to early 90s? I don't remember) we were generally dependent on the infamous BITNET email gateway to communicate with the rest of the world from the well-developed UK network.  It was "interesting" to deal with code in a Swedish 6-bit character set sent through the EBCDIC gateway to ISO 646-GB.  (The Fortran Hollerith formats were added interest...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649340</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article narrates the intriguing story of software piracy in Italy from 1983 to 1993, detailing how the lack of regulatory frameworks and the influence of local culture led to a thriving underground software market. It highlights key players, both pirates and legitimate companies, while exploring the impact of piracy on the software industry and its eventual transition towards legal compliance. The piece also discusses notable legal battles, technological advancements, and the role of the internet in reshaping the landscape of software distribution in Italy during that era.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1990, I was 15 years old and a high school student. Factory clones of the ZX Spectrum appeared in stores, and I often visited the stores, looking at the new computers on the shelves. I already had a programmable microcalculator. My mother worked as the head of the department of automated control of industrial production, she received her salary for a month and bought me a ZX Spectrum 48K computer with all the money, for this I am very grateful to my mother. I learned to program in BASIC and assembler. The computer came with a cassette with the games Zynaps, Exolon, Lode Runner, Boulder Dash, Is-Chess, Robin of the Wood. These games were English, exported through Poland. I knew three people in the whole school, owners of the ZX Spectrum, and it was a huge school, 11 thousand students studied there. We exchanged cassettes with games. Then I used the Copy-copy program, it was right on the tape included with my computer! To make a copy of a game, first the game was read from the tape recorder into the computer's memory for 5 minutes, then I put in a clean tape and recorded the game for 5 minutes, then I checked for another 5 minutes (Verify). Sometimes I came across games in Italian. Hello Italy! There were Polish magazines in Polish. In 2002, I started working in a gaming computer club. There were 12 computers connected by a local network. There were Counter Strike, Half-Life, Sims, GTA III, Warcraft and other games. Games and programs were sold in stores and kiosks. I still have a collection of disks. For example, this is a Windows XP Corporate disk, for which only a serial number was needed. I bought this disk in a store for 2 dollars. Now I use Debian 12. I cannot download a Windows disk image, since many sites are not available in Russia. I can only buy a laptop with Windows installed, but it is expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting movie along those lines, although it's about pirating music rather than games. The protagonists live in Naples.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_by_Erry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611818</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading the article I didn’t pick up what any of the advantages are of 28hr days other than being able to communicate with other regions of the world on certain days. I suppose that could be a very important factor for some people who do work in a geographically dispersed area. A few things I would be concerned with are:
1) your SO is not on the same schedule and really for what isn’t a solid reason. I could see this becoming a source of resentment at some point. 
2) you have to cut people out of your life vs explaining the schedule when they don’t understand why. I understand that the lectures would likely get tiresome at some point, but it seems a bit selfish to switch to this schedule when it could become problematic for friends and family members. 
3) I think cardio and total health should be measured and monitored as part of the experiment. It is entirely possible that this schedule can have real benefits for health or at the least not negatively affect your health. You mention that you are able to workout more often and effectively, so it may also be interesting to track your fitness level on the schedule vs 24 hr days. It would just be anecdotal but it would at least be some data.I guess the only other things I would want to know is what factors pushed most to switching schedules? How long do you plan to stay on the schedule? How does your employer handle this schedule change? Or are you self employed/running a business? What do you think the biggest challenges are during the switch aside from being tired at hour 10-11? What does your SO really think about this schedule? The more I think about this, the more questions I have :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been fascinated with alternative sleep schedules since I was very young. My initial interest turned to a fascination when I realized the only positive long-term reports were usually from people trying to sell something: Their book, a sleep plan, or just using their sleep cycle as a social hook to impress others (influencers, basically). All of the forum reports started out optimistic and then ended in disappointment with basically nobody enjoying them after a long time.One of the common themes was that people would think their lives were better at first. A sort of placebo effect. They’d push through the adaptation phase, which was miserable, and when they adapted they felt slightly better. Often this improvement (relative to the miserable adaptation period) was mistake for an absolute improvement because it had been so long since they had a normal sleep schedule.What was really interesting was that most people reported some variation of the same thing: They didn’t realize how much they disliked the alternative sleep schedule until after they stopped it. Some people stuck with it for a long time until life forced them to change (job, marriage, etc). It wasn’t until they went back to normal that they realized how much better it was to just not fight the sunlight and night time that drives us.It would be interesting to see how this person feels at some point in the future if they go back to a normal sleep schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it amusing how the OP has the need to label meals within the day and gripes about how they don’t match when talking to others on a regular 24-hour schedule. They are just meals. You’re hungry, so you eat. It’s a meal.Only one note: OP sounds like a younger person, probably in their 20s. My body was able to take some serious abuse when it came to sleep schedule back then. I had a job that kept alternating between 2-3 day shifts, then 2-3 night shifts, then 2-3 days off. Sometimes I’d not go to sleep for 24+ hours.I’m twice the age now, and I’m still paying for it. My sleep is not great. I have to be very responsible with sticking to my schedule, and waking up anytime after 3 a.m. results in an inability to fall asleep and a day-long headache.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639779</guid></item><item><title>22.

It's immediately apparent how to use it and I appreciate the brief examples.Quick question: In the breast cancer example from the README, simple support vector machines from sklearn (the first thing i tried to compare baseline performance, incidentally) seem to outperform TabPFN. Is this expected? I know it's a baseline to demonstrate ease of use rather than SOTA performance, but I am curious.    # (TabPFN)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the long-standing mathematical problem regarding the rationality of the number obtained from the solution to a specific equation involving square roots. This problem, originating from the work of mathematicians like Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the 18th century, puzzled experts for decades until it was finally resolved. The article highlights the intricate mathematics involved, the historical context of the problem, and the significance of the breakthrough in understanding rational numbers and their properties.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it quite interesting that pi+e and pi*e are not proven to be irrational (although it's proven that at least one of them is irrational [1]).It would be mind-blowing if either of them were rational numbers, yet it's very hard to prove either way.[1] https://math.stackexchange.com/a/159353&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whoa, good to know that Henri Cohen was involved in this story.He is the co-creator of PARI/GP, the algorithmic number theoretic C library that I used for my thesis (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) as well as four books in Springer's Graduate Texts in Mathematics (GTM 138, 193, 239 and 240 - most mathematicians achieve fame with just one book in this series).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When asked where his formulas came from, he claimed, “They grow in my garden.”This makes me think of Ramanujan's notebooks. And based on my limited interaction with professional mathematicians, I think there is something to this - some hidden  brain circuitry whereby mathematicians can access mathematical truths in some way based on their "beauty", without going through anything resembling rigorous intermediate steps. The metaphor that comes to my sci-fi-fed mind is that something in their brains allows them to "travel via hyperspace".And this then makes me think of GenAI - recent progress has been quite interesting, with models like o1 and o3 at times making silly mistakes, and at other times making incredible leaps - could it be that AI's are able to access this "garden" too? Or does there remain something that we humans have access to, while AIs do not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644896</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Retrotechtacular: Soldering the Tek Way" on Hackaday explores the techniques and practices of soldering used by Tektronix, a pioneer in the electronics industry. It focuses on the importance of high-quality soldering for developing reliable electronics, detailing the specific methods and tools employed by Tektronix engineers. The piece highlights the meticulous attention to detail required in soldering processes, showcases historical context, and provides insights into the craftsmanship that defines professional electronics assembly. The article serves both as a tribute to traditional soldering techniques and as a guide for enthusiasts looking to improve their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's real soldering the Tektronix way.[1] This is the soldering technique for Tektronix ceramic terminal strips, which had silver fired into the surface of the ceramic. The solder used was 3% silver. The innards of Tektronix scopes of that era are just beautiful.Tektronix was the first to make oscilloscopes where the screen was calibrated, and you could measure voltage reasonably accurately. Earlier scopes just let you see the general shape of a waveform. So Tektronix had to develop components and techniques to make electronics behave consistently, over a wide range of temperature and humidity, in portable instruments.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB5JqGo1co&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious if anyone has tips on lead-free soldering. I basically always see in online forums "just use lead," but never any tips on how to actually become capable on using lead-free solder. Esp. as my son is around a lot, it seems prudent to stay lead-free, even if you can generally handle lead safely. Thanks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned to solder electronics using my father's giant Weller soldering gun. 40 years later I was visiting and had to repair a tiny connection on an electronic candle. I felt like Captain Caveman wielding that giant humming pistol with the lightbulb illuminating the work but by cracky I could still do fine work with that monster tool.This was the longest video I have watched on Youtube in ages. The lack of intrusive ads was refreshing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650561</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't get the point in the example of a magnet implanted in the hand. When I drop a screw its either easily picked up with my fingers, or in a place my hand doesn't fit at all. If you really expect to drop small, ferrous objects frequently why not just carry a small magnet, or better yet one of those extending wands with a magnet on the end?The second use case of dragging paper clips is even more confusing. I get the novelty I guess, but that's really worth the risk of the magnet hurting you in some way?They mentioned it being strong enough to pick up scissors or a knife, that seems like a pretty easy way to accidentally slice open the side of your hand. The risk of coming across another strong magnet that snaps onto the meet of your hand also seems like it could be really annoying and painful, like pinching the side of your hand in a drawer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why not just wear gloves with embedded magnets? I don't understand the benefit of implanting the magnet.Implanting seems to come with several drawbacks: infection risk, difficulty of removal if undergoing an MRI, and difficulty passing through security checkpoints.The advantage is... Saving 5 seconds when compared to just wearing a glove with magnets in it? A glove would also likely provide far far better sensing (more and stronger magnets better placed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you misunderstood what Biohacking is and replaced it with body modification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42641109</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the peculiarities of handling NULL values in SQL databases, emphasizing that NULL is not equivalent to zero or an empty string. It explains how NULL affects comparisons, aggregations, and joins, often leading to unexpected results if not properly understood. The author provides examples to illustrate common pitfalls, such as how NULL can lead to false outcomes in conditional statements and how certain SQL functions behave differently when NULLs are involved. The piece ultimately aims to enhance the reader's understanding of NULL handling in SQL to avoid errors and improve database queries.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL NULLs aren't weird, they're just based off of Kleene's TRUE-FALSE-UNKNOWN logic!If you want you can read NULL as UNKNOWN and suddenly a whole bunch of operations involving them become a lot more intuitive:1. TRUE OR UNKNOWN = TRUE, because you know you have at least one TRUE already.2. TRUE AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN, because you don't know whether you have two TRUEs or not. It's just out there.3. UNKNOWN XOR UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN, because it could darn near be anything: TRUE XOR TRUE, TRUE XOR FALSE, FALSE XOR FALSE, FALSE XOR TRUE... Internalizing this is where SQL's use of NULL / UNKNOWN really becomes intuitive.4. (TRUE AND FALSE) XOR (TRUE OR UNKNOWN) = (FALSE) XOR (TRUE) per #1 = TRUE. See, it's consistent, you just need to keep in mind that if you have a lot of known UNKNOWNs they're quite parasitic and your final outcome is likely to be, itself, an UNKNOWN. Just like in real life!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; select null = null; returns NULL, because each NULL is basically a placeholder representing any “unknown value”. Two unknown values are not necessarily the same value; we can’t say that they are equal, because we don’t know the value of either of them.Agreed with all of this, it would probably have been better if they were named `unknown` instead of reusing the `null` keyword.Note also that since Postgresql 15, you can use `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` when creating a unique index [0]. I'm less familiar with other databases.0: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createtable.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Object Oriented Context "null"  is useful to indicate that some object doesn't have value for that property.What's interesting is, do we mean that in our data that attribute has no value? Or do we mean the real-world object represented by the data does not have that attribute?Does null meana) We don't know the value of this attribute 
   for this object, orb) We do know that there is no value for this
   attribute in the real-world object 
   represented by our data.In JavaScript because there is both null and undefined it is easy to assume that undefined means we don't know the value and null means we do know it has no value.EXAMPLE:
The attribute 'spouse'. Some people have a spouse some don't. So what does it mean if the value of the field 'spouse' is null? That we know there is no spouse, or that we don't know who the spouse is if any.In practical terms we can say null means "We don't know" which includes the case that there is no spouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645110</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of double-keyed caching, a technique aimed at optimizing data retrieval in web applications. It explains how this method improves performance by storing cached data under two different keys, which allows for more efficient access and better handling of updates. The post also outlines practical implementation strategies using JavaScript and emphasizes the benefits of reducing redundant network requests. Additionally, it highlights potential use cases and performance considerations, illustrating how double-keyed caching can enhance user experience by speeding up data loading times.&lt;/p&gt;

We (ab)used this to do preloading before it was available in the web platform, e.g. download a JavaScript without executing it:  var js = new Image();
  js.src = 'script.js';
  js.onerror = function(){/* js done */};

Then some browsers started having a separate image cache and this stopped working&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a user, you can use extension like LocalCDN. Instead of having your browser download common libraries and fonts, the extension would intercept the request and serve the local version. Even better in terms of privacy and security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42630192</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the mathematical exploration of the concept of infinity and the different sizes of infinity, particularly focusing on the types of numbers that exist, such as real numbers, rational numbers, and others. It highlights a significant advancement in understanding how many numbers there are by presenting a proof that connects cardinality (the size of sets) with the properties of the continuum hypothesis. The work illustrates the complexities of infinity in mathematics and suggests that mathematicians are making progress towards a deeper understanding of the foundational questions surrounding the existence and classification of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

Links to past threads are just to satisfy extra-curious readers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a trick! Despite the name, the real numbers aren't real at all. Most of them don't exist...Now the computable reals, on the other hand... maybe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But Cantor discovered that natural numbers can’t be put into one-to-one correspondence with the continuum of real numbers. For instance, try to pair 1 with 1.00000… and 2 with 1.00001…, and you’ll have skipped over infinitely many real numbers (like 1.000000001…). You can’t possibly count them all; their cardinality is greater than that of the natural numbers.I take issue with this paragraph. It makes it sound like the infinitude of reals between 1 and 1.00001 is proof there are more reals than naturals. One might think this same fact proves that there are more rationals than naturals...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42627270</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities of consumer-grade routers that are powered by underwhelming power supplies. It highlights how these routers can exhibit strange performance issues, including crashes and connectivity problems, especially under heavy use. The piece emphasizes the importance of proper power supply specifications for reliable router performance and warns consumers about the potential risks posed by inadequate power sources, which can ultimately compromise network security and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Irrelevant.1. Downstream of the mains power supply are DC-DC converters that run the router hardware. Those contain the filters and capacitance you think you're fixing. Nothing in that router actually cares about mains power quality. They absolutely do not care about perfect sinusoids.2. If you were seeing insufficient power to the router, you would observe crashes and faults -- not slowdowns.3. Two different routers showed the same behavior, which suggests that the fault lies outside the router+power supply and more to do with something common (e.g. network, laptop).The dip shows a reduction in voltage, and a larger one than I would like, but without a scale on either time or voltage, it's difficult to guess if it actually matters. I would suspect not, since the device does boot successfully.  Again, the voltage doesn't matter, since the router runs off its internal DC-DC supplies, not the external power supply.I'm happy that the capacitor and new supply has fixed the issue, but I'm unconvinced by the explanation. Check grounding between inverter and laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Clearly, the router is pulling more current during the dip than the power supply on my solar circuit can supply.&gt;[...]&gt;Ideally, we’d want manufacturers to put capacitance to that effect into their router power supplies or at least routers. But we realise that capacitors cost a few cents each and aren’t really required on stable grid supplies. And manufacturing costs matter.Weird this was being seemingly blamed on "puny power supplies", and that "ideally" manufacturers should be overspecing their power supplies to accommodate his use case. Does he also think manufacturers should "ideally" add a battery to routers on the off chance that there's a transient blackout?More to the point, he supposedly has a "4500W peak solar sinewave inverter", and his router probably consumes no more than 50W. That 50W is unlikely to cause issues with such a system, and even if it was the straw that broke the camel's back, it's weird to blame it on the router, rather than the inverter or the entire system. If you had a take-home salary of $10k, blew it all on gambling, then your card got declined on a starbucks purchase, you wouldn't characterize this as "my coffee habit was using more money than my income can supply".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh. Is that line on the scope a one-time glitch at power up, or does it happen on every cycle?"Rummaging through my old parts box unearthed a power supply that was a bit more powerful than the one that came with the router, and even fit the connector." Is he describing a "wall wart" type power supply? A picture would help. A teardown would help more. There are large numbers of really crappy wall-powered DC supplies available, mostly from China.[1]Look for a UL approval marking and a UL approval number. That indicates at least some attention to quality. UL is mostly concerned about fire safety, but their basic test for power supplies includes connecting it to a load box at the power supply's maximum rating, then running it for a while to see if it overheats. This catches power supplies with exaggerated ratings.Avoid no-name power supplies. This is a well-known headache.[1] https://hackaday.com/tag/wall-wart/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613758</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent discovery of a significant archaeological site in the region known as the "Bad Moon Rising" project, where researchers are investigating the impact of lunar cycles on ancient human behavior and settlement patterns. It highlights how the interplay between natural lunar events and human activities could provide insights into the societal and cultural practices of past civilizations. The findings suggest that moon phases may have influenced rituals, agricultural activities, and navigation techniques, offering a deeper understanding of how ancient communities adapted to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Once the threat was deemed to have passed, the king would reassume his position. To dispose of any lingering evil, his stand-in would then be executed.I love how people can believe in an all seeing, all knowing, and all powerful god and yet also believe that deity can be tricked with such an obvious ruse.I don’t know if that’s arrogance, stupidity or desperation. Perhaps a combination of all three.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; houses around 130,000 clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia
&gt; Since so few scholars can read the languages on the tablets—the overwhelming majority remain untranslatedThis would be an awesome job for AI. Get these scholars to train the AI, then have it automatically translate all the other tabletsAlso, are there online scans of the tablets? Maybe the problem is not the scarcity of scholars, but gatekeeping?On a tangent:&gt; These tablets, which likely come from Sippar, a Babylonian city in modern Iraq, were acquired by the museum more than a century ago and date to between 1900 and 1600 B.C.Is "acquired" a euphemism for stolen here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's brutal they'd execute the stand-in after the celestial omen was deemed to have passed. I wonder if the person standing in knew it was coming? Was it a great honour to take the king's place during a crisis, or was the person put there in a more deceptive way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42636424</guid></item><item><title>34.

I disagree.Raspberry Pi offers models ranging from $10 to $120, all readily available — more so than ever.Adjusted for inflation, the original $35 Raspberry Pi Model B (launched 2012) would be $50 today. The Raspberry Pi 5 2GB is also $50 today and vastly outperforms the original, delivering far greater bang for buck.Though I can’t speak to their internal decisions, it’s seems from the outside that they continue to try to maximise the value of the Raspberry Pi while maintaining the original price point.Disclaimer: Co-founder of Pimoroni, one of the first Raspberry Pi resellers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope this is a one-off expensive Pi and not an indication of a new pricing strategy. It would be very disappointing if these hacker computers became expensive toys.The article is very feel-good with the carbon credits and all, but the inflating pricing is a disservice to the hacker community. It shouldn’t be sort of greenwashed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42642873</guid></item><item><title>35.

Get them into Sloan Kettering, Mayo, Duke or OHSU or whoever. Help them look for clinical trials to get chemo past the blood-brain barrier (I've heard some promising things in this area, though I'm not sure if it's being tested on humans yet). If they have a family that's taking care of them, offer to help them. Even just a grocery trip a week or something would be a massive help (obviously this depends on how close you are to them but you get the picture). Hell, offer to just hang out with your friend for a few hours so the family can get out and decompress for a bit if they need to.Don't let them fall into the false hope of "I might have 5-10 more years". The person I knew fell into that and did absolutely nothing they wanted to do before they died because they were in denial and kept holding onto the expectation that they'd get better.If they have money, every cockroach will come out of the woodwork trying to get a piece. Watch out for them if you can.I know someone who got scammed out of a very substantial amount by a real brain surgeon in America(!!!), who referred them to a guy that sold a bogus device which he claimed would "destroy the tumor" (no FCC sticker on it and the entire thing was controlled by a Raspberry Pi when I disassembled it). Brain surgeon had a bunch of FDA complaints against them too and performed it in one of the poorest cities in the country, across the street from a burnt out apartment building. The local pharmacy had a constant police presence because of armed robberies for the drugs. These details scream sketch to normal people, but normal people aren't going to be dying of brain cancer in the foreseeable future. Desperate people will do crazy things if they think it offers some hope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know when someone’s faced with certain death they’ll do almost anything they can to survive if only for a little bit longer, but this thread full of personal antectodes and largely non-reproduced effects from random pubmed articles is the hackernews equivalent of essential oils or smth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should ask them if they want you playing doctor.I have a chronic disease, not fatal, and totally manageable. But the most annoying thing is when someone finds out and suddenly pretends to be the expert.Of course my doctors and I investigating it for years were completely wrong! I should’ve ate more apricots!Please just check with them if they want their limited time spent like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649996</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;"A Supermarket in California" is a poem by Allen Ginsberg that explores themes of consumerism, identity, and the connection between past and present. Set in a bustling supermarket, the poem reflects on the speaker's observations of shoppers and the overwhelming nature of modern life while invoking the spirit of the poet Walt Whitman. Through vivid imagery and introspective commentary, Ginsberg examines the search for meaning in a commodified world, blending social critique with personal longing and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

So I had to hang out in front while my mom shopped.Eventually I turned 10 and got a military ID and could go into the supermarket. My mom would buy a huge pile of groceries (because it was a bit of a drive to the base and she only shopped every 2 weeks), and the cashier's fingers would just fly over the mechanical keyboard. I'm surprised their fingers didn't bleed from doing that all day.The laser scanners are sooo much better.Can you imagine these days leaving your six year old outside while you shopped?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639691</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Poka-yoke is a Japanese term meaning "mistake-proofing," which refers to design mechanisms that help prevent errors or defects in manufacturing and other processes. Developed by Shigeo Shingo, it aims to increase quality and efficiency by creating systems that make it difficult or impossible to make mistakes, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. The concept involves using simple, low-cost devices or methods to highlight potential errors or guide correct actions, ultimately fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Poka-yoke techniques can be applied in various settings, from industrial production lines to everyday tasks in order to minimize the risk of human error.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my industry, we mostly use the term to refer to mechanical features, typically keyways, that prevent connectors from being mated incorrectly.Suppose you have a module with 50 pins worth of connectors, but because some of the signals are in different harnesses which get installed at different times, you can't just use a 50-pin connector. For this example let's say it's sensible to break it up as 20+20+10.You wouldn't use two identical 20-pin connectors since they carry different signals. You probably do want to use the same family of connectors so they use common pins and have a common board footprint. So you get connectors which are the same except for having different keyways, and are often molded of different colors of plastic, by convention.If you've ever been working on a vehicle and seen identical-looking connectors where one's black and one's gray, look closer. Along with a color difference, there's a notch on the housing in a different place.This increases the number of parts that must be stocked, but the decrease in assembly errors is worth it. (And they all share the same tooling, so the manufacturing complexity isn't bad.)Note that this isn't required if the connectors aren't candidates for mismating in the first place. If they appear in completely different places on the harness, then it's totally fine to reuse the very same connector for the amplifier speaker signals in the trunk, and the steering column (turnsignal stalks and stuff) module signals up front. This reduces parts count without increasing errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" - Murphy"Dubble check that spelIng" - MuphryMurphy was a rocket engineer. One day their assistant plugged in a non-keyed connector upside down. It was very easy for that to go wrong.Another time, in another place, a rocket assembly worker hammered in a keyed connector - upside down. It was harder for that to go wrong, but, uh, life finds a way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like collecting little ideas like this. Slightly meta-ironically I'd describe the genre as "just abstract enough to be useful nuggets of knowledge" and I have an org file full of them. The hard part is I don't know any better name for such "concepts" so I can't search for other people's lists.Does anyone else keep a similar collect or have advice for finding more?(For example Gurwinder sometimes posts lists like this: https://www.gurwinder.blog/p/30-useful-concepts-spring-2024 - that's what I'm talking about.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42643532</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Zoom fatigue," a term that describes the exhaustion many people feel after extended video conferencing sessions. It identifies four primary causes of this fatigue: excessive eye contact, the cognitive load of processing visual information, the challenges of interpreting non-verbal cues, and the feeling of being trapped in a screen. To mitigate this fatigue, the article suggests several solutions, such as taking breaks, reducing the number of video calls, using audio-only communication when possible, and reorienting the camera to lessen eye contact pressure. These strategies aim to enhance the virtual communication experience and promote mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never turn on my camera, and minimise the video feeds of everyone else (as in, tab away). Problem solved.I find some people are very pushy about wanting “everyone to have their camera on”, but I just make various excuses (I lost my camera, the laptop is upside down for better cooling, etc). 5 years now, top of the tech tree (to explain that this has not been a CLM), but still making those same silly excuses ;-)You’d think someone might have guessed by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never liked video calls. Or even phone calls for that matter. I put up with them because most of the rest of the world wants to be remote these days. I'm very much an “in person or in writing, not comfortable with the middle ground” sort.Seriously considering a change in career (away from dev &amp; related tech) to something where I and colleagues have to be in the same place by necessity at least some of the time (perhaps some sort of lab work?) but that means a drop in salary temporarily as I'll likely have to start much nearer the bottom than I am now…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I strongly suspect 'outreach' personnel have quotas for booking meetings, regardless of outcome. VC backed infra projects will have full teams with no real customers, just a promise of future profitability. At least some of those seats are dedicated setting up meetings. When they are successful, it is often one VC backed startup trading funds with another VC backed project. End users who pay are less important than the hype. The merry-go-round continues.An annoying waste of time when you are self-funded and their offers assume you have a huge budget. I'm fatigued. The "B" in B2B implies at least one party is doing business with users.Worse yet are the self-styled "marketing experts" or managers of "influencers" who balk at commission structures, insisting on upfront payment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608540</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're dealing with personal health information (PHI), I would advise you to temporarily close your site and hire a lawyer straight away. Whenever you touch this kind of data, regulatory regimes like HIPAA may apply, and you need to be extremely careful. There's not a HIPAA compliance or even a privacy policy statement available on your front page.See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-reg... as a starting point. We might be able to recommend a lawyer to you if you tell us which state you're located in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't want to repeat other comments here; but this app smells of a very dangerous attitude: Built with love by novices with grand intentions, with complete blindness to the real consequences that happen when novices are ignorant in their field.If your goal is to "find a learning project," I suggest finding a very different "learning project." Otherwise, keep "Kate's app" private, word-of-mouth, invite-only for under 20 people.The 1980s and 1990s are long-gone, you can no longer "learn as you go" when the consequences of your application malfunctioning have real-world implications.---A few years ago, my employer used an HR app that appeared built by a novice. In that time period; they sent me a PDF with tax information for half the people in the company; and then they royally screwed up the tax information sent to the IRS for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you know your app is legal to distribute in each country you are distributing in? Anything with the word “medical” in it can be a potential legal mess due to well intentioned but ultimately difficult to manage issues.If you can’t answer that question you really need to listen to the people telling you to take it down until you can work it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42646922</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;VLC media player has surpassed 6 billion downloads, reflecting its widespread popularity and user base. The article highlights VLC's new feature that utilizes AI to generate subtitles, enhancing accessibility and user experience. This innovation aims to make content more inclusive for diverse audiences, showcasing VLC's commitment to evolving with technological advancements while maintaining its reputation as a versatile and powerful media playing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago I used whisper (or rather an OSS subtitle tool that used whisper, sadly can’t remember the name; it also converted burned in subs to proper ones via OCR) to generate subtitles for a season of a Show (4 season DVD set, 1 had proper subs, 2 burned in subs, 1 no subs -.-), too old and not popular enough to have "scene" subs, it worked impressively well. The most memorable thing for me was that a character’s scream was properly attributed to the correct character.I’d love a feature like that for Jellyfin eventually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an art to subtitling that goes beyond mere speech-to-text processing. Sometimes it's better to paraphrase dialog to reduce the amount of text that needs to be read. Sometimes you need to name a voice as unknown, to avoid spoilers. Sometimes the positioning on the screen matters. I hope the model can be made to understand all this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently used some subtitles that I later found out had been AI generated.The experience wasn't really good to be honest - the text was technically correct but the way multiline phrases were split made them somehow extremely hard to parse. The only reason I learned AI was involved is that it was bad enough for me to stop viewing and check what was wrong.Hopefully it's an implementation detail and we'll see better options in the future, as finding subtitles for foreign shows is always a pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644015</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides the complete text of the poem "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" by Richard Brautigan. It explores themes of technology, nature, and the relationship between humanity and machines, reflecting on the potential for coexistence in a digital age. The poem envisions a world where technology enhances human life while maintaining a harmonious connection with the natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had been familiar with the title phrase for many years, particularly through its association with industrial music, but did not know there was a whole poem attached to it until I saw it printed up in a little display on the counter of a pop-up cyberpunk ramen bar at a local Burning Man-affiliated festival.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His poems portray him as a sort of selfish but also very self-aware and basically well intentioned character. The change in tone from poem to poem, and that general vibe makes for an interesting read. They seem very honest.It is interesting that Wikipedia describes him as a Hippy. I somehow got it into my head that he was the last beatnik. But, I can’t find any support for this theory in a quick googling, and I’m pretty bad at literature. So, I wonder where I stumbled across that idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of Nothing But Flowers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iiGqBfyLawFeels like a depth optical illusion - the meaning can change based on perspectivehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_illusionAlso reminds me of Becky Chambers' Monk and Robot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42646932</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has launched its own brand of world models aimed at enhancing machine learning and AI capabilities. These models are designed to create a compressed representation of environments that can be utilized for training in various applications, such as robotics and video game development. By using these advanced models, developers can streamline the training process, making it more efficient and effective. The release highlights Nvidia’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI technology and integrating it deeper into various industries.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this correct then that either the models cannot be used in the EU, or we'll get to know where the training data came from?[1]: https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/en/procedure-fil... - "General-purpose AI systems, and the GPAI models such as ChatGPT they are based on, must meet certain transparency requirements including compliance with EU copyright law and publishing detailed summaries of the content used for training."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why go to techcrunch and not directly to their only source of information on this? There are also some actual technical details there.https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What stops Nvidia from cutting out the middlemen?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You develop your application on an 8GB model and find out that 16GB is much better.  You can choose to port it to some other OS with some other hardware if you like or buy a 16GB Pi 5 and save the effort. The choice is now there.What's so great is that it's all up to you. There are "smaller" or older Pis still being made. More for more is fairly reasonable.If you have a sort of inbuilt bias against "buying second best" that you might consider this a price increase. I have that feeling often. I don't want the second best camera .... and that ends up leading me into stratospheric prices as I finds better and better things.   Fortunately I know this and realise that when I am doing it it's because I don't have a clear use in mind for the item - hence I can't decide what's "enough" so the answer  is not to buy it at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lesson I've learned over the years of purchasing several Raspberry Pi's is this: Unless you're in the need to integrate a project through the GPIO's interface I would be better off spending on one of those (second hand) mini-pcs by lenovo, dell, etc. Even if you want to use it for a low budget mini server, performance for the buck is way better off with a mini pc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Raspberry Pi has been a bad deal for a long time now. Persistent shortages drove the real-world price up (no one was selling them for MSRP) and for some reason they never came back down.Cheap tiny PCs are better at the high end, and increasingly-capable microcontrollers are better for tinkering. The Pi sits in a weird niche, and its popularity these days is largely based on inertia and network effects.It's been a slow, strange shift away from a $25 computer meant for kids to learn programming and electronics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42642992</guid></item><item><title>49.

I had to click a direct link to the option from their help pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I deleted my Facebook account back in 2015.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on the move (nomad) for close to 3 years now. First year full airbnb. Second year, mostly airbnb. This third-year, I have around $800 of airbnb credit that I am yet to use. And I really want to use it. Airbnb has just became the worst of both worlds: 1. For hotels, it has an inferior booking experience and is more expensive. So I just book with booking.com and 2. for longer rentals, the experience is both unpredictable and the price are x2-3 times higher.Case in point, I am in a Vietnamese city right now. I looked airbnb and the places I see average $500-700/month. Instead, I did a short walk around the coworking space I rented at and found a comparable place for $200/month. Big Plus: I got to see the place BEFORE placing the non-refundable one month rent. The place is literally across the coworking space (just have to cross the street).As an extremely lazy person that prefer to use online methods than asking random people, I really wonder who is still using Airbnb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;“In this case, the guest booked on the evening of Jan. 7, after the wildfires had started,” a company spokeswoman told The Post.&gt;However, she added that the company has “contacted the guest to issue a full refund as a goodwill gesture” due to the “fast-moving situation.”https://nypost.com/2025/01/08/lifestyle/airbnb-user-fumes-af...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airbnb will always side with the host if possible, because hosts are much more valuable to their platform than guests. I had a similar situation a couple years ago when Santa Cruz was hit with catastrophic flooding; despite providing them with plenty of evidence that the place I was trying to visit qualified for a refund, Airbnb refused to give me one (telling me I needed to get one from the host, who was also not obliging) in clear violation of their policies. They also later deleted a negative review I left detailing said interactions with the host   as "off topic." Thankfully there's always the option to do a credit card chargeback, but such experiences make it pretty clear how little these platforms actually care about their customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42643254</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of having a "spot the difference" superpower, emphasizing the importance of keen observation in various aspects of life, including personal development, decision-making, and fostering creativity. It highlights how this ability can lead to better problem-solving skills and enhanced awareness of surroundings. The author encourages readers to cultivate this skill by practicing mindfulness and reflection, which can ultimately lead to greater insights and improved cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At a local bar they had a game machine, and if you got a high score on any of the games, your tab for the evening was free.One of the games was a "spot the differences" between two pictures with an ever decreasing timer for each round. Using this trick I was able to easily surpass the high score, and garner a crowd watching me perform this mind numbing feat.Probably my peak fame right there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We got a magic eye book when I was maybe 6 - some time early elementary school. After learning how to do it, and also trying it by crossing my eyes to see an "inverted" image, I started doing it whenever I saw some repeating pattern IRL. It was most interesting when it was slightly uneven, for example a fence with sloppily applied vertical planks. Doing the magic eye would make it seem like some of them are closer to you than others. Eventually I tried the same on those "spot the difference" games since well it seemed kinda obvious to try, and I was blown away that it accidentally gave me that "superpower". I think that was pretty smart for a 6yo. Has only gone downhill ever since. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I discovered this trick independently about a decade ago, to use cross-eyed viewing to easily spot differences between two similar images. Like you said, the parts that mismatch appear to shimmer and be unstable, making them obvious.However, I feel eye strain from doing it, so I prefer other methods. 99% of the time, I do https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_comparator instead, just switching between two images with zero flicker and zero displacement offset. Also with both eyes, it's easier to spot certain kinds of subtle differences like color shifts, JPEG-like compression artifacts, tiny differences in antialiased renderings, etc.One benefit of the cross-eyed method, though, is that you can difference videos. But the use case for that is rarer than differencing images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655870</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Anna's Archive discusses the significance and implications of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) in the digital age. It explains how ISBNs are vital for cataloging and identifying books across various formats and platforms, emphasizing their role in facilitating access to literature. The piece also highlights the challenges posed by the rapid digitization of books, including issues of copyright, accessibility, and the evolving nature of book publishing. Furthermore, it advocates for open access to literature and reflects on how ISBNs can affect the availability and distribution of books in a more interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see that bounty at the bottom, so tossing away my chances here, but this visualization is just asking to be mapped onto a Hilbert Curve. [0] When you "stripe" the data like this, points that are sorted close together could end up pretty far apart, since a distance in the Y axis skips an entire row of data as you move down, rather than a distance in the X axis which is 1-to-1 with the source data.If you map it onto a hilbert curve, the X and Y axis mean nothing, but visually points that are close together in the sorted list, will be visually close together in the output image.Since the first part of an ISBN is the country, then the second part is the publisher, and the third part is the title, with a check sum at the end, I would remove the checksum and sort them each as a big number. (no hyphens)You should end up with "islands", where you see big areas covered by big publishing countries, with these "islands" having bright spots for the publisher codes.Bonus points for labeling these areas!I set up something a while ago [1] for an interview that does this with weather data. It makes the seasons really obvious since they're all grouped together.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve[1] https://graypegg.com/hilbert (https://github.com/graypegg/hilbertcurveplayground code if anyone wants to go for the prize using this! Please at least mention me if you decide to reuse this code, but I can't stop ya lol)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing is, ISBNs aren't hierarchical --- they are bought in blocks (or even individually at an exorbitant markup, says the guy who bought one to reprint a single book), so this doesn't show anything really interesting/useful.A visualization using LoC or even Dewey Decimal would be far more useful, esp. if it also linked to public domain and copyright-free repositories/lists, say an interactive and visual version of John Mark Ockerbloom's:https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anna's archive is one of the wonders of the world. If we almost destroyed our species but Anna's archive endured, there would be hope for a relatively expedient reconstruction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652577</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote about my experience working as a software developer and being black in the industry and I was lucky to have it published on BBC [1].What immediately followed, every large company reached out to have me work as a consultant for their diversity program. I found it fascinating that they had a team of DEI experts in place already. Like what makes one an expert?In addition to my job, I spent nights developing programs trying to help these companies. Some folks right here on HN shared their successful experiences and I presented it to several companies. I was met with resistance every step of the way.Over the course of a year and hundreds of candidates I presented, I've managed to place just one developer in a company.However, most these companies were happy to change their social media profile to a solid black image or black lives matters. They sent memos, they organized lunches, even sold merch and donated. But hiring, that was too much to ask. A lot of graduates told me they never even got to do a technical interview.Those DEI programs like to produce a show. Something visible that gives the impression that important work is being done. Like Microsoft reading who owned the land where the campus was built [2] in the beginning of every program. It eerily reminds me of "the loyalty oath crusade" in Catch-22.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23669188[2]: https://youtu.be/87JXB0t6de4?si=wtnQtBOE-fs4V7gR&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am Wasq'u (a tribe in the PNW), I am connected to my tribe, and I am one of a handful of remaining speakers of the language. I am really tired of being caught in the maw of people fighting about my identity, what I am owed, and to some extent what place my identity has in society.To the pro-DEI crowd: I have some hard truths for you. Actual change requires commitment and focus over an extremely long period of time. That means you have to choose probably 1 cause among the many worthy causes, and then invest in it instead of the others. You can't do everything. The problems that afflict my community are running water, drug addiction, lack of educational resources, and secular trends have have made our traditional industries obsolete. I am not saying that land acknowledgements and sports teams changing their names from racial slurs are negative developments, but these things are not even in my list of top 100 things to get done.We all want to help, but to have an impact you must have courage to say no to the vast majority of social issues you could care about, and then commit deeply to the ones you decide to work on. Do not be a tourist. I don't expect everyone to get involved in Indian affairs, but I do expect you to be honest with me about whether you really care. Don't play house or go through motions to make yourself feel better.When you do commit to some issue, understand that the biggest contributions you can make are virtually always not be marketable or popular—if they are, you take that as a sign that you need to evaluate whether they really are impactful. Have the courage to make an assessment about what will actually have an impact on the things you care about, and then follow through with them.To the anti-DEI crowd: focus on what you can build together instead of fighting on ideological lines. The way out for many minority communities in America is substantial economic development. In my own communities, I have seen economic development that has given people the ability to own their own destiny. It has changed the conversation from a zero sum game to one where shared interests makes compromise possible. If you want to succeed you need to understand that your fate is shared with those around you. In-fighting between us is going to make us less competitive on the world stage, which hurts all of us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a PoC, and stuff like this reads extremely bizarre to me. On the one hand, you're acknowledging rolling back DEI initiatives in part because of the "political landscape," and that you were already committed to diversity on your teams. That's all well and good, but then, why the initiative in the first place? It seems to me you're doing at least 1 thing here, and acknowledging that such DEI program was performative in the first place. This kind of announcement seems extremely self defeating and unlikely to please anyone and piss off just about anyone that cares about this in any way shape or form, on either side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657901</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the cultural impact and legacy of the Japanese film "Battle Royale," highlighting its role in shaping the survival genre long before the emergence of global hits like "Squid Game." It discusses the film's controversial themes of violence and survival, its critique of societal structures, and its influence on both Japanese and international media. The piece also compares the distinct storytelling and social commentary of "Battle Royale" with that of "Squid Game," emphasizing how both works reflect on human nature and societal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a much stronger connection between Battle Royale and Hunger Games, than Squid Game. Very similar government depiction, the announcement of deaths etc. Moreover, we should appreciate Battle Royale even more - because it was done waaay before any prior art existed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a little odd to me how much media attention these shows are getting, yet how little debt, more specifically usurious interest rates that lead to inescapable debt, as a general factor of modern life is discussed.I suppose most of the contestants in the shows are in debt because of gambling or overtly irresponsible decisions, but it would be more interesting IMO if the contestants were in debt from student loans, credit cards with 25% interest rates, medical debt, and so on. But I guess a show making that particular social critique isn’t going to get funded by a major studio or tech company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And before Battle Royale, there was Kaiji.It's identical. People with debt invited to a game and a chance at loads of cash. People die in the game and some get enslaved. Rich people sit in another room and laugh while they watch people suffer. There's even a game where the "contestants" walk high up and fall to their deaths.Then the main character gets called back into the game and you get a season 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652967</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm personally working on something like this for the ESP32, but written on top of micropython [1]. A few things are written in C such as the display driver, but otherwise most things are in micropython. We chose the T-Watch 2020 V3 microphone variant as the platform [2].Our objective is to build a modern PDA device via a mostly stand-alone watch that can be synced across devices (initially the Linux desktop). We want to achieve tasks that you might typically do on your desktop, focussed towards productivity.We did consider a custom OS, but decided against it for a few reasons:1. Allowing somebody else to handle basic OS stuff allows us to concentrate on what really matters, the higher level stuff on top.2. Having multiple threads in micropython is super simple and we are able to run many active apps at the same time, rather than having to kill them off [3]. Our background apps can continuously interact with the network in the background.3. Code written for micropython can be easily run on other Python-capable devices.[1] https://micropython.org/[2] https://lilygo.cc/products/t-watch-2020-v3[3] https://tactility.one/#/application-lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshtastic is another project that has recently made serious strides[0] in their UX on the Lilygo T-deck (and similar ESP32 devices), but specifically regarding LoRA-enabled devices.It's still on a branch, but I compiled and ran it, and now I have two T-decks that can communicate with eachother off-the-grid without a smartphone attached to send messages; it's actually usable in emergencies now, which is why I bought the devices in the first place.Currently in the process to deploy a mesh from me to my parents and family.[0]: https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/3259&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This appear to be a window system and desktop environment than OS, but isn't it that ESP32 user code always runs atop FreeRTOS for radio management purposes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42653811</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a scorecard evaluating the predictions made by Rodney Brooks regarding technological advancements and societal changes anticipated for the year 2025. Brooks reflects on various predictions, assessing their accuracy based on the current state of technology and societal trends as of January 2023. Key areas of focus include robotics, AI, and automation, with a mix of successful and inaccurate forecasts. The evaluation serves to illustrate the unpredictability of technological progress and its implications on the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels too self-congratulatory when he claims to be correct about self driving in the Waymo case. The bar he set is so broad and ambiguous, that probably anything Waymo did, would not qualify as self driving to him. So he think humans are intervening once every 1-2 miles to train the Waymo, we’re not even sure if that is true, I heard from friends that it was 100+ miles but let us say Waymo comes out and says it is 1000 miles.Then I bet Rodney can just fiddle with goal post and say that 3.26 trillion miles were driven in US in 2024, and having a human intervene 1000 miles would mean 3.26 billion interventions, and that this is clearly not self driving. In fact until Waymo disables Internet on all cars and prices it never needs any intervention ever, Rodney can claim he’s right, even then maybe not stopping exactly where Rodney wanted it to, might be proof that self driving doesn’t work.Next big thing after deep learning prediction is clearly false. LLM is deep learning, scaled up, we are not in any sense looking past deep learning. Rodney I bet wanted it to be symbolic AI, but that is most likely a dead end, and the bitter lesson actually holds. In fact we have been riding this deep learning wave since Alex-Net 2012. OpenAI talked about scaling since 2016 and during that time the naysayers could be very confident and claim we needed something more, but OpenAI went ahead and proved out the scaling hypothesis and passed the language Turing test. We haven’t needed anything more except scale and reasoning has also turned out to be similar. Just an LLM trained to reason, no symbolic merger, not even a search step it seems like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That being said, we are not on the verge of replacing and eliminating humans in either white collar jobs or blue collar jobs.Tell that to someone laid off when replaced by some "AI" system.&gt; Waymo not autonomous enoughIt's not clear how often Waymo cars need remote attention, but it's not every 1-2 miles. Customers would notice the vehicle being stopped and stuck during the wait for customer service. There are many videos of people driving in Waymos for hours without any sign of a situation that required remote intervention.Tesla and Baidu do use remote drivers.The situations where Waymo cars get stuck are now somewhat obscure cases. Yesterday, the new mayor of SF had two limos double-parked, and a Waymo got stuck behind that. A Waymo got stuck in a parade that hadn't been listed on Muni's street closure list.&gt; Flying carsProbably at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. They won't be cost-effective, but it will be a cool demo.
EHang recently put solid state batteries into their flying car and got 48 minutes of flight time, instead of their previous 25 minutes. Ehang is basically a scaled-up quadrotor drone, with 16 motors and props. EHang been flying for years, but not for very long per recharge. Better batteries will help a lot.[1] https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/electric-air-taxi-flights-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good example of everything that can wrong with a prediction market if left unchecked. Don't like that Waymo broke your prediction? Fine just move your goalposts. Like that prediction came true but on the wrong timeframe? Just move the goal posts.Glad Polymarket (and other related markets) exist so they can put actual goal posts in place with mechanisms that require certain outcomes in order to finalize on a prediction result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651275</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading some of these books recommended here, perhaps the most shocking thing is that so much is due to randomness: an arbitrary person does something small that turns out to be on the critical path, and without it the big thing would not get completed.I like the kind of books recommended here, but please be aware of survivor's bias (there not many books about failures! Any great recommendations? "How we could NOT get back to the moon again", "Recall: Toyota hits the breaks", "Last fag: how big tobacco lost against a Minneapolis law firm" ;-) and the fact that the winner gets to write the history. For example, next month, Bill Gates new memoir "Source Code" will come out, the first of three planned autobiographical books, and I doubt he will share with us how he strongarmed PC manufacturers into shipping Windows pre-installed in order to get the OS monopoly and other important events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very much a shameless plug but I wrote a book, Rebooting a Nation, on how the country of Estonia was able to modernize post re-independence in the early '90s and become a leader in e-government (99% of government services accessible online) and a tech hub (Skype, Transferwise, Bolt, etc.). I tried to draw out practical lessons for policymakers in other countries, especially in the U.S. as I wrote it after having worked for the Estonian government and advised some members of Congress in DC on tech policy. It's available for pre-order now and comes out in a few months, link below.https://www.rebootinganation.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Box by Marc Levinson is the incredible story of the dawn of containerized shipping.It is a little shocking just how recently this happened (the very first experimental loads were in the 1950s), and that the standard of shipping before containers was for longshoremen to literally hand carry boxes of stuff onto ships and stuff them just anywhere. You would be stunned to realize just how new and unused the piers of San Francisco really are, because they were built with massive government subsidies at exactly the wrong time.The book covers the courageous people involved, the political and economic impacts, and how the industry truly found its footing prioritizing absolutely reducing operational costs over all other concerns (like delivery speed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42614722</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Metrics for the Evaluations of the Sequence of Decoding" presents a comprehensive examination of different metrics used to evaluate the performance of sequence decoding methods in various contexts such as language processing and machine learning. It critiques standard metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, discussing their limitations and proposing alternative approaches for more reliable and effective evaluations. The research emphasizes the importance of assessing decoding quality through both qualitative and quantitative measurements to improve model performance in generating accurate and contextually relevant sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find their critique compelling, particularly their emphasis on the disconnect between CoT’s algorithmic mimicry and true cognitive exploration. The authors illustrate this with examples from advanced mathematics, such as the "windmill problem" from the International Mathematics Olympiad, a puzzle whose solution eludes brute-force sequential thinking. These cases underscore the limits of a framework that relies on static datasets and rigid generative processes. CoT, as they demonstrate, falters not because it cannot generate solutions, but because it cannot conceive of them in ways that mirror human ingenuity.As they say - "Superintelligence isn't about discovering new things; it's about discovering new ways to discover."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That is, language
 models learn the implicit meaning in text, as opposed to the early belief some researchers held that
 sequence-to-sequence models (including transformers) simply fit correlations between sequential
words.Is this so, that the research community is agreed?  Are there papers discussing this topic?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; Behind this approach is a simple principle often abbreviated as "compression is intelligence", or the model must approximate the distribution of data and perform implicit reasoning in its activations in order to predict the next token (see Solomonoff Induction; Solomonoff 1964)For the record, the word "intelligence" appears in the two parts of "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference" (referenced above) a total of 0 times. The word "Compression" appears a total of 0 times. The word "reasoning" once; in the phrase "using similar reasoning".Unsurprisingly, Solomonoff's work was preoccupied with Inductive Inference. I don't know that he ever said anything bout "compression is intelligence" but I believe this is an idea, and a slogan, that was developed only much later. I am not sure where it comes from, originally.It is correct that Solomonoff induction was very much about predicting the next symbol in a sequence of symbols; not necessarily linguistic tokens, either. The common claim that LLMs are "in their infancy" or similar are dead wrong. Language modelling is basically ancient (in CS terms) and we have long since crossed in the era of its technological maturity._______________[1] https://raysolomonoff.com/publications/1964pt1.pdf[2] https://raysolomonoff.com/publications/1964pt2.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655098</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of formal wear, specifically focusing on its significance and evolution in modern society. It outlines various types of formal attire for different occasions, including black tie, white tie, and cocktail attire, while emphasizing the importance of understanding dress codes to make appropriate choices.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formal verification of software, as the article acknowledges, relies heavily on the type of software and the development process.To use formal verification you need to have formal requirements of the behavior of your software. Most software projects and design philosophies are simply incompatible with this.In software development and design can often fall together, but that means that it is uniquely ill suited for formal methods. If you are developing, before you are sure what you even want, then formal methods do not apply.But I agree that there are certain areas, mostly smaller, safety critical, systems, which rely on upfront specifications, which can heavily benefit from formal verification. E.g. Aerospace software relies heavily on verification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see this line of reasoning about formal methods a lot: software is big and complicated and hard to get right... therefore formal methods.On the one hand, I _want_ this to be true both for selfish and practical reasons: selfishly because I'm very very good at learning things that require an academic learning approach (read a book, work some exercises, practice) and if something I'm good at is important, that means more money for me.  Practically because they're right, software _is_ big and complicated and hard to get right and as a practitioner, it's really frustrating when it does fail and I'm scrambling to figure out why.On the other hand, though, nobody ever seems to make a compelling case for how formal methods proposes to solve that problem.  This author actually does better than most by pointing out how most modern "design" is a waste of time but doesn't really go into why TLA, say, is better than (demonstrably mostly useless) UML.  There's sort of an implied suggestion that if you dedicate a few months (or years?) to learning TLA, you'll reach enlightenment and understand how it's helpful in a way that's impossible to articulate to the unenlightened.  And that's not impossible to imagine!  Calculus and Bayesian statistics are kind of like that; you need to really understand them before you can really see why they're useful.I always find myself left applying what I call "project manager" logic - I need to make a snap decision right now about whether or not I should invest time in this "formal method" stuff or not so I have to be observational: if it was really that helpful, more people would be applying it and the benefits would speak for themselves.  They've been around a long, long time, though, and never caught on - it's hard not to conclude that there's probably a reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lightweight formal methods callout is a good one. Maintaining a suite of proptest[1] strategies alongside the codebase is not a very much larger investment than writing unit tests by hand, but the insights they provide due to extensive coverage and compact understandable failure cases are way better. And crucially this approach does align with normal software development practices.[1] https://crates.io/crates/proptest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656433</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would love to see a pterosaur / bat version of this drone. Birds use one set of muscles to jump in the air and another to flap their wings, limiting how big they can get.  That’s because, if you make your wing muscles bigger, then you need bigger leg muscles to support them, then you need bigger wing muscles to support your legs, etc.  pterosaurs and bats have tiny little legs and use their “arm” (wing) muscles to do the initial jump into the air.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and complexities encountered while implementing OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework for cloud-native software. The author shares their personal experience, highlighting issues such as intricate setup processes, difficulties in configuration, and a steep learning curve associated with the various tools and components involved. The piece ultimately emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of OpenTelemetry to effectively leverage its capabilities for monitoring and improving application performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole time I was learning/porting to Otel I felt like I was back in the Java world again. Every time I stepped through the code it felt like EnterpriseFizzBuzz. No discoverability. At all. And their own jargon that looks like it was made by people high on something.And in NodeJS, about four times the CPU usage of StatsD. We ended up doing our own aggregation to tamp this down and to reduce tag proliferation (StatsD is fine having multiple processes reporting the same tags, OTEL clobbers). At peak load we had 1 CPU running at 60-80% utilization. Until something changes we couldn’t vertically scale. Other factors on that project mean that’s now unlikely to happen but it grates.OTEL is actively hostile to any language that uses one process per core. What a joke.Just go with Prometheus. It’s not like there are other contenders out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/anacrolix/notel?tab=readme-ov-file#what-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Otel seems complicated because different observability vendors make implementing observability super easy with their proprietary SDK’s, agents and API’s. This is what Otel wants to solve and I think the people behind it are doing a great job.
Also kudos to grafana for adopting OpenTelemetry as a first class citizen of their ecosystem.I’ve been pushing the use of Datadog for years but their pricing is out of control for anyone between mid size company and large enterprises. So as years passed and OpenTelemetry API’s and SDK’s stabilized it became our standard for application observability.To be honest the documentation could be better overall and the onboarding docs differ per programming language, which is not ideal.My current team is on a NodeJS/Typescript stack and we’ve created a set of packages and an example Grafana stack to get started with OpenTelemetry real quick.
Maybe it’s useful to anyone here: https://github.com/zonneplan/open-telemetry-js&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655102</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and release of the game "Bubble Bobble" for the Commodore 64 by the programmer Geon. It outlines the challenges faced during the game's creation, including technical limitations and gameplay design decisions. The post also shares insights into the game's mechanics, graphics, and music, as well as the nostalgic appeal of bringing a classic arcade experience to the C64 platform. Additionally, it highlights the efforts made to capture the essence of the original game while adapting it for home computer gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In two player mode, still even today, C64 Bubble Bubble is one of the best casual games. I can sit down almost anyone on the couch and they'll enjoy at least a few rounds, experienced video game players or not.That the game design and implementation cuts through FOUR decades of time to be enjoyable says something. There are many old games which still are good but not as accessible to a modern audience.There are even more old games which are impressive even in retrospect, but don't play well today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice analysis, and cool to see how simple it is to get quite a satisfying effect. Also quite fun to see that the level symmetry was indeed exploited multiple ways to save space. If the author is here, they write '"@123" are the first 4 entries in the default c64 character set' but likely meant @ABC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 1998, a level editor was made for the Arcade version of Bubble Bobble, named "Patch-A-Bobble".  This level editor revealed the directional airflow in the levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611077</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always find that sharing those little tedious details is what creates visceral understanding of a situation. In this case, the true horror of being a liberated Black person in the 1800s and having to relentlessly work to rescue others, while surrounded by people who truly don't care.On a lighter note, I use the same approach in understanding user needs as a product builder. I focus on letting people share the minutiae of their day rather than have them editorialize the big topics. By doing so, I get a lot of visceral insight and intuition.Thanks for sharing this. I really enjoyed reading it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a great example for the point that the author is trying to make. The fact that after all that effort, Ruggles was only able to free 2 out of 5 enslaved men is apropos. His victory was incomplete, incremental at best, and nearly got him enslaved again as well, but it was still a victory and it counted, especially for the two men that did get their freedom.Shout-out to a grindset abolitionist!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Finally, on Christmas Eve, a group of armed black New Yorkers (reportedly not including Ruggles) boarded the brig Brilliante and managed to rescue two of the men.This sentence kind of contradicts the author's point though? After all that tedious work within the legal system it wasn't even procedure that got any of these men freed, but actual direct action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655636</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;MacBASIC is a version of the BASIC programming language developed for the Macintosh computer. It was one of the early programming environments for Mac, allowing users to create software using a simple and accessible interface. The article discusses its features, such as its integrated development environment, syntax, and the ability to manipulate the Macintosh's graphical capabilities. It also highlights the historical context of MacBASIC within the evolution of Apple software and its impact on programming practices for the Macintosh platform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andy Hertzfeld shared the background on why MacBASIC didn't ship with the Mac.&gt; Apple's original deal with Microsoft for licensing Applesoft Basic had a term of eight years, and it was due to expire in September 1985. Apple still depended on the Apple II for the lion's share of its revenues, and it would be difficult to replace Microsoft Basic without fragmenting the software base. Bill Gates had Apple in a tight squeeze, and, in an early display of his ruthless business acumen, he exploited it to the hilt. He knew that Donn's Basic was way ahead of Microsoft's, so, as a condition for agreeing to renew Applesoft, he demanded that Apple abandon MacBasic, buying it from Apple for the price of $1, and then burying it.https://folklore.org/MacBasic.htmlIt was a shame, since MacBASIC allowed users to write software that supported the features of the Mac UI and Microsoft's BASIC did not.&gt; Benchmarks published in Washington Apple Pi Journal suggested that MacBASIC had better performance as compared to Microsoft's MS BASIC for Macintosh. The language included modern looping control structures, user-defined functions, graphics, and access to the Macintosh Toolbox. The development environment supported multiple programs running simultaneously with symbolic debugging including breakpoints and single-step execution.https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBASICHowever, the late betas were out in the wild with no copy protection, so it was passed around by user groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a 128K Mac owner who bought Microsoft's BASIC for the Mac, this still makes me angry.Then Apple released HyperCard and that was nice, until they dropped it.Then Runtime Revolution was released, and I found it quite nice to use, then they opensourced it as Livecode and I pledged for that, then they quit supporting the Community Edition and closed the code again (anyone know if anyone is making progress on getting this to compile/work/install?).These days I just use Python, but I'd really like to see a nice option for GUI development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because of this posting, I found the "1.0" version at Macintosh Garden and started playing with it in an emulator. It is pretty neat and advanced for the time -- while it supports the traditional line number/goto/gosub style of BASIC, you can also not use line numbers and define multi-line functions with "function/end function" and basically have something as structured as Pascal. Obviously this style of BASIC was common in the 1990s with Visual Basic and the like, but for 1984 this was unusual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612085</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the nature of formalized mathematics and its accessibility to both mathematicians and non-mathematicians. It explores a specific proof in mathematical logic, highlighting how the complexity of formalism can create barriers to understanding. The author, Stephen Wolfram, argues for the importance of intuitively grasping mathematical concepts beyond formal proofs and emphasizes the need for effective communication in mathematics to bridge the gap between expert understanding and broader comprehension. The piece ultimately advocates for making sophisticated mathematical ideas more approachable to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the perennial questions about proof automation has been the utility of proofs that cannot be understood by humans.Generally, most computer scientists using proof automation don't care about the proof itself -- they care that one exists. It can contain as many lemmas and steps as needed. They're unlikely to ever read it.It seems to me that LLMs would be decent at generating proofs this way: so long as they submit their tactics to the proof checker and the proof is found they can generate whatever is needed.However for mathematicians, of which I am not a member of that distinguished group, seem to appreciate qualities in proofs such as elegance and simplicity. Many mathematicians that I've heard respond to the initial question believe that a proof generated by some future AI system will not be useful to humans if they cannot understand and appreciate it. The existence of a proof is not enough.Now that we're getting close to having algorithms that can generate proofs it makes the question a bit more urgent, I think. What use is a proof that isn't elegant? Are proofs written for a particular audience or are they written for the result?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting how sometimes it feels like a topic starts showing up super often all of the sudden. It probably isn't a coincidence, since my interest and probably this post's interest is due to Tao's recent equation challenge https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/ .I was surprised and intrigued to find Wolfram's name when I was reading background literature doing this blog post https://www.philipzucker.com/cody_sheffer/ where I translated my friend's Lean proof of the correspondence of Sheffer stroke to Boolean algebra in my python proof assistant knuckledragger https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger (an easier result than Wolfram's single axiom one).I was also intrigued reading about the equational theorem prover Waldmeister https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/automation-of-logic/s... that it may have been acquired by Mathematica? It's hard to know how Mathematica's equational reasoning system is powered behind the scenes.Mathematica can really make for some stunning visuals. Quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although Wolfram doesn't mention it by name, this is closely related to what he is trying to do: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42654995</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the game Cuttle, a two-player combat game typically played on a 5x5 grid. Each player controls a set of pieces, using tactics to capture the opponent's pieces through strategic movement and placement. The article explains the rules in detail, including how pieces can move and capture, as well as variations of the game to enhance play. It aims to guide new players in understanding the gameplay and to offer insights for more experienced players seeking to improve their strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a huge fan of card games that can be played with a regular deck of cards, and I play Cuttle with my kids somewhat regularly. It's a fast-paced game, but you do have to get over the initial learning curve of the effects. I find just printing out a piece of paper with a quick reference on it helps.As others have alluded to in the thread, teaching people the rules is a barrier. As I looked around for a professionally printed game, I found a game that was very much like Magic the Gathering, but also just a single box of cards called Mindbug.https://mindbug.me/Turns out it was designed by some folks that brought Richard Garfield in near the end of its design and he ended up having some say in the final product. I've played it a couple of times and each game is only played with a random subset of the cards, so the combinatorics create a lot of replay value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone who wants a more complex game proximate to this design, there's a small production called Reinforcements (https://reinforcementscg.myshopify.com/). Non-collectible, single box.You play a hand of up to 5 cards each turn: Adding cards to (concealed) stacked ranks of defending troops, attacking an opponent's ranks, using a card's ability. The suits have different defensive properties when arranged in a rank, and combine in interesting ways; there are also "ultimate" powers players can grab from the center by forming their ranks with particular arrangements of suits, which act as turtle-busters.Highly recommended, quite fun, probably plays best 1v1. Definitely a lot of small rules to absorb, so it's a more complex beast. But nowhere close to the complexity of Magic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are the notes I wrote for myself as a magic player, to translate it into purely MTG terms. (These probably aren't enough to explain on their own, but they'll probably help MTG players who want to get the gist.)Your opponent has 21 life and you win when your creatures have at least that much power. You can’t attack.Setup: dealer goes second and starts with 6 cards, opponent starts with 5 cards. Hand limit of 7.On your turn:
Either play 1 card or draw 1 cardPoint cards (ace - 10; ace is 1) are creatures with power equal to their point number. 
Face cards (and sideways 8) are enchantments.
No lands or mana costs. 
"Playing" a card refers to casting that card or channeling that card.Every point card has “channel -  discard this card: Choose a creature with lesser value. Destroy it.” (suit matters, spades &gt; hearts &gt; diamonds &gt; clubs, e.g., 8 of hearts is greater value than 8 of diamonds or any 7 but less than 8 of spades or any 9.) Note that this doesn't target.Most point cards can be played as sorceries for an alternate effect:Ace: wrath of God2: disenchant OR muddle the mixture (this is the only instant and does not count toward your 1 card per turn limit. Everything else is sorcery speed)3: regrowth4: mind rot5: divination6: tranquility / back to nature7: mind’s desire8: sideways as enchantment - glasses of Urza9: aura extraction*10: noneFace cards are exclusively enchantments:Jack: control magic**Queen: Privileged position***King: reduce your opponent’s life total based on the number of kings you control for as long as they remain on the battlefield: 0: 21; 1: 14; 2: 10; 3: 7; 4: 5.Notes: The card types are pretty explicit - muddle the mixture can only counter sorceries or instants, not creatures, enchantments, or channeling. Wrath of god only kills creatures, tranquility only kills enchantments.Rules can differ, depending on the source:* sometimes as "reflector mage for enchantments", sometimes as "unsummon for enchantments".
**sometimes as "exchange control of target creature". 
***sometimes as "all permanents you control have hexproof", I.e., including itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42658614</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Finland's successful strategy to achieve zero homelessness, which focuses on providing permanent housing solutions as a foundational approach. Key components of this strategy include the Housing First model, which prioritizes immediate housing for the homeless without preconditions, and comprehensive support services that address the underlying issues contributing to homelessness, such as mental health and substance abuse. The Finnish government’s commitment, effective use of resources, and collaboration with non-profit organizations are also highlighted as critical factors in reducing homelessness. The article emphasizes the importance of this model as a potential blueprint for other countries facing similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also do a lot of compulsory psychiatric detention: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychiatric-bulletin...&gt; Finnish mental health legislation takes a medical approach to compulsory measures, emphasising the need for treatment of psychiatric patients over civil liberties concerns... Finland has the highest rates of detention per 100 000 inhabitants, about 214 compared with 93 in the UK and 11 in Italy.&gt; If at the end of the 3-month period it is considered likely that detention criteria are still fulfilled, new recommendations MII and MIII are filed and the renewed detention is then valid for 6 months. However, this second period of detention has to be immediately confirmed by a local administrative court.edit: I should mention that I've seen fairly convincing cross-sectional evidence that homelessness is more related to the housing market than mental illness: https://www.ucpress.edu/books/homelessness-is-a-housing-prob... ,  https://www.nahro.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NAHRO-Summi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This issue is very relevant for me since I have been homeless since May. It's been a bad run of being a target of criminal activity, unemployment and just running out of money during my job search. I cope with a mix of volunteering, overpriced housing (think $1200/month for a room in a rural area before I ran out of money for that), catsitting, house-sitting, staying with family and sleeping in my ancient car. Although I'm a citizen I don't qualify for any government support or programs, even though we have employment insurance here which I paid into for years.I'm from Ottawa where the cold is obviously deadly, as it is in Finland. I do feel that we need to take shelter more seriously in public policy compared to warm areas because of that. Last week someone froze to death overnight a few blocks away from where I was crashing on a couch with family. Walking through downtown Ottawa and seeing the huge empty, lit, warm buildings with people freezing to death right outside is striking. Any practically minded person can see the problem is political and philosophical, not practical.I can tell all the posters who think people choose to be homeless that I'm certainly not one of them. The comments about the importance of avoiding a downward spiral are certainly correct. Searching for work is hard enough normally and becomes increasingly difficult without access to things like a kitchen and toilet.What I see in this Finnish policy is the starting assumption that doing nothing is not a good option. After reaching that point there can a rational discussion about what to do with whatever money is being spent - do you pay more people to hand out blankets and conduct surveys or just use it to buy housing units? As a homeless person I would really like to see Canada have a policy like I'm reading in this article instead of what we are doing now. The crappy temporary shelters and bureaucratic spending strategy obviously isn't working.Even just economically, to have a government pay for years of schooling and subsidize advanced degrees then just be ready to let that person die on the street when they are ready to work but can't happen to find something seems like a waste. I'd rather see a functioning "social safety net" as described in this article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without digging too deep into the nature of the statistics they use, I'm a little skeptical of this.The transition to using the word "homeless" has resulted in transforming something we can't easily measure -- "drug addicted or mentally ill people being a public menace" -- into something that we can measure -- "people without a good living arrangement".Sure, the latter is important in a lot of ways too. And there housing is a tolerable solution.But the former is the actual problem that we care about. It's nearly impossible to measure. It's nearly impossible to fix. The horrors of involuntary commitment vs. the horrors of not having involuntary commitment vs. the horrors of using the criminal justice system vs. the horrors of not using the criminal justice system.The fact is that we have no real model for treatment of severely mentally ill people. We have a number of effective drugs, but they rapidly become ineffective if not taken. Our ability to treat or "cure" people in these conditions is essentially non-existent.The question I would ask of Finland before considering this data or analysis to be interesting is what is their state of involuntary indefinite commitment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656711</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the creation of Vade Studio, a platform built using Clojure, emphasizing the challenges and motivations behind the project. It highlights the belief in tackling difficult problems as a way to foster growth and innovation, and details the team's commitment to utilizing Clojure for its functional programming capabilities, simplicity, and robust ecosystem.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clojure is a lot of fun to tinker with, but man… I love my static types. I think I’d hate to work on a large codebase in Clojure and constantly be wondering what exactly “m” is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting story.  I am not entirely convinced that all credit should go to the programming language here, though.My theory is that communicating abstractions is hard.  If you work on your own, or in a (very) small team, you can come up with powerful abstractions that allow you to build amazing systems, quickly.  However, sharing the underlying ideas and philosophy with new team members can be daunting.  As systems grow, and mistakes are made, it becomes more and more likely that you run into serious problems.This may also be why Java and similar object oriented programming languages are so successful for systems that have to be maintained for ages, by large teams of developers.  There are but few abstractions and patterns, and it does not allow you to shoot yourself in the foot, nor to blow your whole leg off.  Conversely, this may also be why complex frameworks, such as Spring, are not always so nice, because they introduce (too?) powerful abstractions, for example through annotations.  It may also clarify why more powerful languages such as Scala, Common Lisp, Smalltalk, Haskell, etc, consistently fail to pick up steam.Another theory is that not every developer is comfortable with abstract concepts, and that it simply takes a team of smart people to handle those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious if Elixir could provide a similar development environment?Seems like many similar capabilities, like a focus on immutable data structures, pure functions, being able to patch and update running systems without a restart, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42622264</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Co-founder of Quickwit here.  Seeing our acquisition by Datadog on the HN front page feels like a truly full-circle moment.HN has been interwoven with Quickwit's journey from the very beginning. Looking back, it's striking to see how our progress is literally chronicled in our HN front-page posts:- Searching the web for under $1000/month [0]- A Rust optimization story [1]- Decentralized cluster membership in Rust [2]- Filtering a vector with SIMD instructions (AVX-2 and AVX-512) [3]- Efficient indexing with Quickwit Rust actor framework [4]- A compressed indexable bitset [5]- Show HN: Quickwit – OSS Alternative to Elasticsearch, Splunk, Datadog [6]- Quickwit 0.8: Indexing and Search at Petabyte Scale [7]- Tantivy – full-text search engine library inspired by Apache Lucene [8]- Binance built a 100PB log service with Quickwit [9]- Datadog acquires Quickwit [10]Each of these front-page appearances was a milestone for us. We put our hearts into writing those engineering articles, hoping to contribute something valuable to our community.I'm convinced HN played a key role in Quickwit's success by providing visibility, positive feedback, critical comments, and leads that contacted us directly after a front-page post. This community's authenticity and passion for technology are unparalleled. And we're incredibly grateful for this.Thank you all :)[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27074481[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28955461[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31190586[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32674040[4] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35785421[5] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36519467[6] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38902042[7] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756367[8] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40492834[9] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40935701[10] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42648043&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, it looks like Quickwit was going to add an Enterprise license as of earlier this year (PR #5529), which I had been keeping eyes on, but this announcement says they're instead going to relicense as Apache 2.0 so the "community can continue on":&gt; We will be focused on building a new product with Datadog, and to ensure our open-source community can continue, we will soon release a major update of both Quickwit with a relicense to Apache License 2.0 and tantivy.So, it looks like we'll get a more liberally licensed Quickwit, but reading between the lines suggests development of it is might otherwise be winding down? It has been pretty nice and stable in my experience, so I can't really complain much. But I was really looking forward to what else it could bring.Congrats to the team, in any case!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The clock begins counting down to Datadog figuring out how to charge per node, cpu, container, RAM (KB), and unicode characters indexed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42648043</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the design and implementation of tracing in PyPy, a Python interpreter that focuses on performance optimization. It explores the concept of "tracing" as a method to enhance execution speed by dynamically profiling Python code and generating specialized machine code. The author reflects on the challenges and philosophy behind tracing, including considerations of how to efficiently manage resources and the impact of tracing on programming paradigms. Overall, it provides insights into the technical intricacies and thought processes involved in developing a high-performance interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like LuaJIT probably deserves a mention here. It doesn't always get astounding performance, but it very often does, and you get all the inlining and dynamic specialization goodness that tracing JITs make cheap.  And it demonstrates extremely convincingly that PyPy's difficulty with invoking native code isn't essential to tracing JIT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article. I'd like to also know PyPy developers thoughts on the copy-and-patch approach chosen to implement the new JIT under development for CPython.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42610091</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses images captured by the M-CAM instrument on the BepiColombo spacecraft, which reveal the shadowy northern polar region of Mercury. These observations provide insights into the planet's surface composition and geological features, highlighting areas that may contain water ice and other volatiles. The findings enhance our understanding of Mercury's environment and its potential for future studies related to planetary formation and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ESA's article claims to "reveal" Mercury's shadowy north pole, yet the image provides no actual insight into the pole itself, which remains shrouded in permanent darkness... The term "revealed" feels more like marketing spin than substance, as the image merely captures the general area around the pole.This framing is reminiscent of similar oversights in planetary science, such as the perplexing case of Mars' north pole. Studies suggest a cyclical process where subsurface vapor escapes through a thinned crust during colder seasons, freezing into massive ice deposits, like those seen in the Korolev Crater. These ice layers, some over 1.2 miles thick (see the ESA Korolev Crater Study), challenge the traditional narrative of Mars' geophysical activity. Observations from missions like Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal hints of dynamic interactions between the crust and atmosphere, yet much of this is glossed over in mainstream discussions.Why is there a persistent pattern of incomplete or opaque presentations regarding planetary poles? The public deserves transparency and detailed interpretations, not handwaving claims. If the evidence of crustal thinning and volatile release is as compelling as the imagery suggests, why the reluctance to address it head-on???A commitment to clarity would foster trust in scientific institutions, rather than leaving informed observers to speculate about what's being left unsaid. This is frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With labels describing the surface features: https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/01/Mercury_s_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely love the ESA Like button in the article. Conveys the feeling it's designed by a flight instruments engineer rather than a social media frontend person (make sure to click it twice).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42658512</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of monospace ligatures in programming fonts, highlighting how these ligatures can enhance code readability and aesthetics. It explains the purpose and benefits of utilizing ligatures, which combine certain character pairs into single, more visually appealing symbols. The author shares personal experiences and opinions on different monospace fonts that support ligatures, as well as tips for configuring text editors to incorporate them. Overall, the piece serves as a resource for developers interested in improving their coding experience through font selection and customization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general, I think having ligatures in a monospace fonts is a bad idea.The reason is that in a monospaced font all the glyphs are supposed to the same advance value. This forces the ligatures to always take up the same space as two (or however many glyphs) are involved, which may stretch the ligature glyph in a non-intended way (if it is even possible to rasterise it that way).Monospace fonts are also often used for programming (because they make sure that the columns line up consistently, regardless of the font being used). I personally don't see the point in showing ligature glyphs that do not correspond to the actual Unicode code points encoded to bytes in the source code.Just my 2 cents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the ligature from MonoLisa is a good example of how not to do ligatures. I can't tell whether it stands for "#={" or "#{". Ligatures can be nice, to each their own, but only if they don't introduce ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why should code have to be in a monospace font?I've read and written all my code and that of others in proportional fonts for at least 15 years.Of course there are coding styles that look better in a monospace font, e.g. if you use column alignment instead of simple indentation.But even those are nearly as readable in a proportional font.So things don't line up perfectly? Big deal.As a specific example, any Python code formatted with Black will be equally readable in a proportional font or a monospace font.This is because Black forgoes column alignment tricks and uses simple indentation for everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650501</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advanced topics in C programming, specifically focusing on manipulating and utilizing the `void*` type in innovative ways. It explains how to leverage type-generic pointers for flexibility in data handling and includes examples of creative solutions, like implementing a type-safe variant for functions. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding memory management and the implications of using pointers to enhance code efficiency and maintainability. Overall, it encourages programmers to explore unconventional programming techniques in C while maintaining clarity and safety in their code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expect many people know this one, but it's a useful teaching aid when understanding the relationship between arrays and pointers  int array[10];
  *(array+1) = 56;
  array[2] = 4;
  3[array] = 27;

The first two are obvious, but the third is also legal.  It works because array indexing is just sugar for pointer arithmetic, so array[2]=4 is identical in meaning to *(array+2)=4.  Therefore 3[array]=27 is identical to *(3+array)=27 and so is legal.  But just because you can doesn't mean you should.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to speculate a bit on why these silly things are in C.C was developed on a PDP-11 that had 64Kb of memory. That's not much of any at all. Therefore, the compiler must be extremely tightly coded.The fundamental rules of the C language are pretty simple. But articles like these expose consequences of such simple rules. Fixing them requires adding more code. Adding more code means less room for the code being compiled.Therefore, if the intended use of the language works, the pragmatic approach would be to simply not worry about the quirky consequences.A more interesting question would be "why do these characteristics persist in modern C compilers?"The stock answer is "backwards compatibility", "Obfuscated C Code contests" and "gotcha job interview questions". My argument would be that there is no reason for the persistence of such "junk DNA" and it should be deprecated and removed.I've done my part. D doesn't support that stuff, even though the basic use of the language is easily confused with C.For example:    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    void main()
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i);
            printf("%d\n", i);
    }

I've died on that hill. I know others who lost an entire day staring at it wondering what's wrong with it. I saw it on X recently as "99% of C programmers will not be able to find the bug."The equivalent D code:    import core.stdc.stdio;
    void main()
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i);
            printf("%d\n", i);
    }

gets you:    test.d(5): Error: use `{ }` for an empty statement, not `;`

C'mon, Standard C! Fix that!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had read the GCC documentation and I did not know about the forward parameter declaration. I did know about the other stuff that is mentioned there (and in the first part).Declarations in for loops is something that I had only ever used in macros (I had not found it useful in other circumstances), such as:  #define lpt_document() for(int lpt_document_=lpt_begin();lpt_document_;lpt_document_=(lpt_end(),0))
  #define win_form(xxx) for(win_memo win_mem=win_begin_();;win_step_(&amp;win_mem,xxx))

(The compiler will optimize out the loop and the declared variable in the use of the lpt_document macro; I had tested this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657591</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "flattening" in the context of software design, particularly focusing on how reducing complexity in code structures can lead to clearer and more maintainable software. It emphasizes the benefits of flattening nested structures or unnecessarily convoluted designs, which can often hinder understanding and increase the potential for errors. The author provides examples and explains various scenarios where flattening can improve readability and streamline functionality in programming. Overall, the piece advocates for simplicity and clarity in software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Instead of allocating Expr objects willy-nilly on the heap, we’ll pack them into a single, contiguous array."
Zig compiler pipeline (AST, Zir, Air, Sema) does exactly this on all layers. Not only contiguous, but instead of array-of-structs it is struct-of-arrays, so walking the tree is even more cache friendly. For AST see: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/zig/Ast.z...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought a reddit comment on this article had an interesting point:https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1d3b356/my_new_favori...[–]Timzhy0 3 points 7 months agoBtw I think one can go a step further than the author, there is no need to keep two explicit ExprRef baked in a binary node (lhs, rhs). You can exploit locality, basically the AST, seen it the LISP way, is just an arbitrarily nestable list, where elements are atoms or other lists. Hence all you need to know is where each list ends (and if it's an atom you can assume it spans one node) and actually one bit to know if it is the last entry in the list is quite ergonomic as well (because then you can distinguish whether moving next slot in the AST means there is a sibling). Basically it's easier to keep it sync while constructing and takes up less memory per node. I pay 40 bits per node, stored interleaved for best cache locality (some unaligned accesses but I think it's still worthwhile), 8 bits for the tag, 32 for the data, if data is bigger, 32 is an index into some auxiliary segment (basically a ptr).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rediscovering techniques that were somewhat well-known in the 70s and 80s.See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42659061</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to read an older piece of clean C code once in a while. Gives me that cozy retro feel and fond childhood memories.Beautifying the output sounds like a good idea, perhaps something like this should be an option of standard ls?What strikes me is that the code (which is very idiomatic of C code) is very expressive at the function level, but most of it happens inside the few functions, and the function bodies are much less readable for those who don't write C ls clones all day. The main function is very long because it handles command line switches, that boilerplate could be moved to a function or library.The file lc.1 (UNIX man pasge) is missing, as has already. been pointed out.• simple/compact: single file• small: 446 lines of C code• flat/monolithic: lots of global variables, no separation between functionality and I/O, no separation between command and library API that does the core part of the work.(Just posting what was on my mind, not my intention to attack this fine work!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW, one can download Coherent as a VM:https://www.icl1900.co.uk/unix4fun/coherent/ftp/vms/Additional Information:https://www.icl1900.co.uk/unix4fun/coherent/http://www.nesssoftware.com/home/mwc/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the author sees this: please copy/paste the manual in your README instead of including an image with text on it.

So besides not being able to try this app, there is also no way to cancel my automatic payments, which starts on Jan 18.After fixing this onboarding problem, I suggest making it possible to try without giving any personal information. (I expected the video player on the landing page to be functional, but I guess just the note section is.)Also there are many typos on the site. Like "loged in as"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks cool, love work in this direction. I wonder how learning rates w this would compare to taking notes on paper like in a traditional lecture, which some studies show improves learning [0].[0]: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-writing-by-ha...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really neat idea actually! 
I love the landing page, both the interactive part and particularly the visual style. 
One thing that I would note though, is that scrolling down, I expected the images to be interactive since they blend in with the rest of the page and look like interactive elements. I would either try to make it more obvious that they are example images, or actually make them interactive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42621989</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the trends showcased at CES 2025, highlighting concerns over the future of smart TVs that are increasingly packed with unwanted software features and gimmicks. It emphasizes how these devices may prioritize profits through advertising and other monetization strategies over user experience and product quality. The piece warns that the push for advanced functionalities could lead to more bloatware, intrusive ads, and a decline in overall usability, urging consumers to be cautious as the industry moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not the first pointless downgrade of the LG remote: they've already removed the pause button.Now pausing and unpausing is done with the general-purpose click-wheel, is up to each app to implement, and is dependent on the UI state.If a wrong element is focused (which is not hard to do, because the button is a scroll wheel surrounded by directional buttons), you may end up toggling subtitles or some other option when trying to pause or unpause.It used to be a hardware button that always worked, was trivial to find by feel, easy to activate, and worked instantly.Now it's "wait, I need to pause! Oops, I moved the scroll wheel button by a notch when pressing it, so it's a mouse cursor now! I fast-forwarded to the second half of the movie and the audio is in French."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “For us, our biggest goal is to create enough value that yes, you would be willing to pay for [Gemini],” Google TV VP and GM Shalini Govil-Pai told the publication.&gt; The executive pointed to future capabilities for the Gemini-driven Google Assistant on TVs, including asking it to “suggest a movie like Jurassic Park but suitable for young children” or to show “Bollywood movies that are similar to Mission: Impossible.”That seems so incredibly useless it reads like parody. No, I will not be willing to pay for Gemini for that.I can’t imagine ever asking questions like those in my life... and even if one day I were drunk, high, and concussed enough to ask, I wouldn’t need to ask my TV—I could just go to claude.ai on my phone instead because I already pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LG keeps missing the obvious: I want in my next TV is a couple more HDMI ports and dumber software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650855</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service, is set to provide faster and more affordable internet access to African users by 2025. It highlights the potential impact of this service on the continent, where many regions suffer from unreliable and costly internet options. The piece explores the implications for local economies, education, and connectivity, and examines both the benefits and possible challenges of implementing Starlink in Africa, such as regulatory hurdles and competition with existing providers. Overall, it presents Starlink as a transformative force for improving digital access in underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;

People here are having to use Chilean addresses to register the kits and pay for a mobile package.[0] https://www.sure.co.fk/broadband/broadband-packages/[1] https://guernseypress.com/news/2024/10/02/sure-ordered-to-pa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Safaricom and other legacy providers have responded by lowering prices and increasing internet speeds.Super exciting to see competition working.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This may be an incorrect generalization, but I thought I read that in much of Africa, people do not really use fixed ISPs.  They just use the cell phone infrastructure for their internet needs via their phones.  I understand this is because cell phone infrastructure is a lot cheaper to roll out and also that there was less desktop computers, etc to plug into ethernet cables.So this article seems to be comparing against something that isn't very popular in the first place - fixed ISPs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657692</guid></item><item><title>32.

One of the early comments in that book is what Dmitri Belyaev (idea man) really wanted was to run this on chimpanzees, but (paraphrasing his words) "a) due to breeding cycles the minimum time to results 6 centuries" and "b) the ethics of doing this would not pass any committee". He chose foxes since they breed once a year and he was able to justify it on commercial grounds (fur production). Results are absolutely spectacular, as the book lovingly documents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earlier: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594851&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42619898</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a research study focused on the vulnerabilities associated with modern CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in the context of email and browser fingerprinting. It highlights how the complexity of CSS can be exploited to create 'spy sheets' that facilitate tracking users across different platforms. The study presents techniques for leveraging CSS features that are commonly used in web design to clandestinely collect data, thereby illustrating potential privacy concerns. It emphasizes the need for awareness and countermeasures to protect users from such tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was impressed at the accuracy they were able to get with browser/architecture detection:&gt; Concretely, our expression reveals differences in 1116 OS-browser combination pairs (94.9 %).Very cool to see that they've even gone as far as inferring elements like the likelihood of MS Office being installed on your computer by checking the width of a container with the font 'Leelawadee' specified:&gt; As this font is a non-free Microsoft font for the Thai Language, we do not expect users without Microsoft Office to have it installedThere is lots of really interesting information in here past what you might figure out yourself if you've played around with abusing CSS yourself before. So many things that had just never, and probably would never have, occurred to me to try.It is definitely worth a read (or skim) over the paper to see the lengths they went to in order to figure out some of the unique elements to fingerprint on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this is a privacy nightmare but also kinda... cool? Or at least interesting. I don't think I would have thought of this.1. Measure element dimensions and detect installed fonts (measure a piece of text with specific a specific font to see if its installed)2. CSS functions (e.g calc) that produce different results across browsers/systems3. Detecting browser-specific CSS property differences (e.g render a file input, measure it)seems like you have to allow `@container` checks or something similar for this to work in order to then make your network request `#something { background-image: url('/x-browser-y-os-detected'); }`&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a two-part problem.1) You can fingerprint devices using CSS2) You can make server calls using CSS to exfiltrate the client-side dataStopping (2) would limit the utility of (1).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42621711</guid></item><item><title>34.

I find myself searching for something to make in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652329</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant leak involving the Gravy location data app, which unintentionally exposed sensitive personal information from millions of users. This data, originally collected for advertising purposes, included precise location histories linked to individuals, raising serious privacy concerns. The leak highlights the broader issue of how location data is tracked and shared, often without users' explicit consent, and underscores the need for stricter regulations around data privacy in the advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;

Google forwards info to bidders, who calculate how much they will spend to show you the ad. This means even the losers of the auction get a firehose of data. There are companies set up right now whose purpose is to lose that auction but collect the data anyways.It should not surprise you to learn, then, that In-Q-Tel (the non classified investment arm of the CIA) has invested in some of these analytics (read: digital surveillance) companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One point I do not see addressed in the article is how the location is collected.It'd be a little bit of a stretch to call IP geolocation as collecting location data as it is usually no more accurate than just procuring the geolocation yourself, so there's no need to get it from a broker. However, on an Android for example, both ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION require permission dialogs, so how does it exactly work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    comm -12 &lt;(cat gravy_app_list\ -\ count.csv| uvx --from csvkit csvcut -c 2 | rg '\.' | sort) &lt;(adb shell pm list packages -3 | cut -f 2 -d ":" | sort)

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It's quite common in machine learning operations to multiply a matrix of unsigned byte by a matrix of signed byte. Don't ask me why, but that's the case.Overflow is the reason. Intel's vpmaddubsw takes int8_t and uint8_t to give you results in int16_t. If both are unsigned 255 * 255 = 65025 will be out of range for int16_t (−32,768 to +32,767) so likely the instruction is designed to take int8_t and uint8_t. However, if one is signed and other is unsigned extremes -128 * 255 or 127 * 255 are always in int16_t range. The overflow (or rather saturation with this instruction) can still occur because it sums adjacent multiplications. See my comment in PyTorch. https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/a37db5ae3978010e1bb7...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious how this compares with, say, the implementation of gemm_s8s8s32 in Intel's MKL / OneAPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656529</guid></item><item><title>37.

Winner promise that and reality was ~250km. There was no chargers installed on terminal loops because it should handle whole day on single charge. That is result of designing system without actual tests and rely only on vendor promises :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This company isn't the only one running autonomous shuttle buses - what makes theirs different from their competitors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many competitors though?

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an in-depth exploration of the concept of time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. It explains how time can pass at different rates depending on relative speeds and gravitational fields, using simple language and mathematical formulas to illustrate these principles. The site includes practical examples and calculations to help readers understand how time dilation affects high-speed travel and is relevant in contexts like GPS technology and astrophysics. Additionally, it highlights the implications of time dilation for both theoretical physics and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author's description of twin paradox is incorrect. In fact, the paradox is not described at all. The paradox is that since motion is relative then from both twin's perspective the other twin goes on a journey and ages slowly. So why it is that on returning, only the traveling twin has aged slowly? The answer is that both twins indeed see each other age slowly but for the traveling twin to come back they have to slow down to zero and reverse direction. At that moment the frame is no longer inertial. While turning around, the traveling twin will see the stationary twin age very quickly (enough to catch up with their earth age), so when they meet there's no paradox. For each of them the other has aged as per their observations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you stop so you don't go whizzing past Alpha Centauri at near light speed? :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woah, thanks for all the comments on this little calculator I built yesterday afternoon.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of codemods as a tool for automating API refactoring in software development. It emphasizes how codemods can simplify the process of updating codebases when an API changes, highlighting their effectiveness in large projects where manual refactoring would be time-consuming and error-prone. The author provides examples of when and how to use codemods, illustrating the benefits of integrating them into a development workflow to improve code quality and maintainability. Key points include the need for thorough testing after refactoring and leveraging the community resources available for developing custom codemods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick the immediate direction that will put you in a position to work with the smartest people. That’s probably more important than picking a technology.Your side projects with agents have impressed people in your org. Do those people impress you? My gut reaction is that if they are impressed by the side projects of a recent college grad, they may not be at the top of that field.At an early stage of your career, the best work environment is one that makes you feel like “damn I’m really going to have to perform to keep up here.” It’s not great to be very early in your career and feel like “damn, I’m the smartest guy in this room.” It can create bad habits and a sense of entitlement.And the tricky thing is, if you are a high performer, most situations will make you feel like the latter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different take here -In my career it hasn't mattered if I'm cleaning bathrooms or building Software used by millions of people IF I'm doing it with people I enjoy being around. The people you work with will make or break your career, and (this will be shocking) if you're smart and like working on hard problems you'll end up wanting to be around people who are like that... so choose your direction based on the people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If space lives up to even a fraction of its potential over the next ~10-20 years then robotics is going to grow astronomically as a field. More generally I have not found software to be a longterm satisfying career - the compensation, freedom, and potential are all excellent. You are well compensated, can work from anywhere*, and a single successful side project (don't sign away your rights to code you write outside of work) always has the possibility to blow up into something worth billions - this is really unlike any other "normal" career. But I think there's a reason that there's a growing sect of people leaving to do everything from farming, woodwork, and even welding. Building even simple things in the real world is somehow so much more satisfying.If I had it to do over again I'd pick a field where software complements something done in the real world - robotics, astronomy, aerospace, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651226</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed review of Kagi Search and the Orion web browser after a three-month user experience. It highlights key features of Kagi Search, such as its privacy-focused design, customizable search algorithm, and streamlined interface, which enhance the user's search efficiency. The review also discusses the Orion browser's integration with Kagi, emphasizing its fast performance, user-friendly layout, and the ability to manage web tracking. Overall, the author finds both tools to be effective for users seeking a more private and personalized online experience, although there are areas for improvement that are noted.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used kagi for quite a while now, and i use it pretty much exclusively. I was unhappy with google ignoring many terms in my search queries and giving me results that I generally considered to be 'intro' pages and generic content, even when my searches were very specific. I have found kagi much better. I dont use any of the advanced stuff like summarisation or ai stuff, i just want search results that have my keywords in them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My brief review of Kagi: I’m never going back to ad-supported search.I rely heavily on internet search for my job, and Kagi has made everything so much faster that I’ve almost stopped thinking about the search engine entirely. Google search had become frustratingly ineffective, often requiring me to dig deep to find what I needed. With Kagi, it just works. I rarely have to scroll beyond the first few results. In fact, Kagi’s effectiveness has made me search even more—now, I use it naturally without considering other services.While this article highlights some valid concerns people may have with Kagi, I think the service is solid enough that everyone should give it a try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kagi is a tough pill to swallow. Their search is hands down the best around, there's no other way around it.That being said, $10/mo is also expensive.The workaround I found is using Kagi Ultimate. I get access to Claude (and I'm still able to attach files + access a dozen other LLMs) for $25/mo, so I was able to cancel Claude and keep Kagi and get the best of both worlds from either product.Side note: incredible that a small team like Kagi's can somehow use LLMs more effectively in search than a company that has years of search experience (i.e. Google)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652125</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;A recent survey reveals that 41% of employers globally anticipate reducing their workforce by 2030 due to the increasing implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The article discusses how industries are re-evaluating their staffing needs as automation and AI capabilities advance, highlighting concerns about job displacement and the shifting landscape of employment. It emphasizes the need for workforce reskilling and adaptation to prepare for these changes, as many employers believe AI will significantly alter their operational structures.&lt;/p&gt;

"Oh but it's just trend gathering".41% of the business today won't exist by 2028.And reduce, reduce staff by what? 2%, 10%, 50%?This is just so silly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WEF 2018, https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-repo...&gt; by 2022, 62% of organization’s information and data processing and information search and transmission tasks will be performed by machines compared to 46% today. Even those work tasks that have thus far
remained overwhelmingly human—communicating and interacting (23%); coordinating, developing, managing and advising (20%); as well as reasoning and decision-making (18%)—will begin to be automated (30%, 29%, and 27% respectively).WEF 2020, https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-repo...&gt; we estimate that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced by a shift in the division of labour between humans and machines, while 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms.Asymptotic Intelligence is almost here!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run an accelerator out of a huge law firm in Canada. I'm not much involved with the firm outside of using the startup lawyers to get the work done for my founders, but lunch room chatting happens. It's been interesting to hear the discussion: inbound is actually increasing due to AI, AI is both giving bad advice (or more often, good advice badly) and drafting nonsense, or missing so much case law it build weak cases etc. I don't think we will hire less, I don't think we'll downsize, I think we'll just take on work we said no to perviously because it wasn't interesting or whatever, and I think client satisfaction will increase. (also AI tools for huge firm lawyers doing big client files are comically bad, one large legacy player recently turned on the AI feature and it kept telling the lawyers to consult a lawyer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652076</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;A kimchi refrigerator is a specialized appliance designed to store kimchi at optimal conditions, enhancing its fermentation process and flavor while extending its shelf life. These refrigerators typically feature adjustable temperature zones and humidity controls tailored to the needs of kimchi, distinguishing them from standard refrigerators. The design aims to maintain the unique textures and tastes of fermenting foods, often offering separate compartments for different types of kimchi. Kimchi refrigerators are particularly popular in Korean cuisine, reflecting the cultural significance of kimchi in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

Kimchee taste really does work itself into things in the fridge.I recall a roommate from decades ago (son of Korean immigrants) mention that his parents always kept a small side fridge / mini-fridge for the kimchee, so everything else in the standard fridge wouldn't adopt the flavor -- I think a comment of his was "kimchee flavored butter is not pleasant."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2000 I moved into a shared house in NJ. A few weeks into living there we noticed a growing awful smell coming from the basement. We found that the previous residents had left their kimchi fridge full of kimchi … and had unplugged it before they left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermented foods are a particular interest of mine. I am by no means an expert but I love that we can take very perishable ingredients and make them into other food stuffs using fermentation. Tea, milk, vegetables, bread, etc. can all be fermented and yeast and SCOBY can do so much for us. It’s amazing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42626809</guid></item><item><title>47.

To help make things a bit more clear, our images now override the PS1 with a `(environment)` at the beginning, which is a different color, lab=green, dev=purple, prod=red. If it saves me once, it was worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I really want is a way to get a read only root shell. I do a lot of work on a "traditional" multi-user unix host, where hundreds of scientists share a powerful computer. I often need to become root to look at files. I want to be able to do that without the ability to screw anything up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why should my user have the right to shut down a production box?Having a tool to warn me that I'm about to do something I shouldn't be allowed to do is okay.

Your domain does not launch a new "bi" (whatever that is). The .new TLD is managed by Google and they do enforce this requirement.&gt; .new is a domain extension exclusively for performing new actions online: any act that leads to creation can have a quick and memorable .new shortcut associated with it. Help your customers take action faster. Less time clicking means more time creating.You will lose your domain.&gt; While anyone can register, domains that don’t comply with this usage policy may be suspended or deleted by Google Registry without refund.https://www.registry.google/policies/registration/new/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI focused new BI products are a wash, your focus should be a new BI product with maybe an AI integration (Not the other way around), or an AI integration to an existing BI product. The BI tool Kanaries / PyGWalker is a good example of where python based BI tooling should be going, replacing big corp BI tools to get CDO/CIO's to go the direction of abandoning Tableau/PBI for lower infra and platfrom cost, open source tooling &amp; integration.I am not saying its a bad idea, but your net is wide, very wide, you are trying to conquer two separate area. Both areas need innovation in the data space, but I think the AI rush is dieing down. Claude and GPT offer good support for PowerBI and Tableau, but there are no  extension integrations. This is where BI AI should be, AI's integrated into Tableau workbooks editing the core XML of the workbooks, offering translation tooling to convert Prep to Alteryx, Tableau to PBI...etc.It's also hard sell if your core platform doesn't cover SSO, Encryption, DB integrations, Self Deployment, RBAC's, PenTest, Corps looks for these things immediately, and BI tools are purely a Corp thing not a Consumer thing.That said its a cool idea and implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello fellow builder. I think the BI space is definitely ripe for change and I do wish more products had better dashboards for users!That being said, embedded analytics is a tough space, because established BI tools (PowerBI, etc.) can be used and are preferred by data teams, or software engineers just fiddle directly with things like plotly or highcharts.Similarly by now "AI Analytics" is getting crowded: https://github.com/Snowboard-Software/awesome-ai-analyticsLooking forward to watching your journey and ideas!FYI, we're building https://getdot.ai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612237</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve always wondered who else uses Ruby on Rails besides the usual names like GitHub, Shopify, Basecamp, etc.Last month, I built a directory of web apps built with the Rails framework.With Rails 8 released last year, the framework is stronger than ever. Some even say it’s experiencing a renaissance.There are already 21 submissions, and if you use Rails, you’re welcome to add your app or website!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails is probably one of the most complete, turnkey frameworks I’ve ever used for web development. When I first encountered it, within a day or two, I was building full stack crud apps.However, what shocked me, having come from a C/C++ background were the thousands of dependencies for the most simple of apps. This scared me as how could I possibly understand the security holes and inner workings of all these dependencies.Another problem I ran into was the tendency of rails developers to create monolithic applications with little separation between the UI, middle tier layer, and the data model layer. When I would be writing client side apps and interfacing with rails back ends, The rails teams would always implement new functionality into the website and then separately add functionality to an API. I think this comes down to the way people learn to develop in rails as rails teaches a monolithic method. I would always try to point out that creating an API where all of the logic was held, would make life so much easier for them, and they would agree, but continue to build The monolithic website with a separate API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails 8 made me love Rails again after a few years working with other tools. The new direction is just perfect, specially for solo developers. The 'solid trifecta' in combination with the simplicity of using sqlite3, the new built in auth solution, Kamal... everything, so f*ing good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656559</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the "Makefile effect," a phenomenon where developers inadvertently create complex dependencies in their projects, similar to how a Makefile functions. It highlights how this can lead to unintentional complications in code maintenance and project structure, making it harder for developers to understand the relationships between different components. The author advises being mindful of this effect when organizing code and suggests practices to keep projects simple and manageable while avoiding unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."– John Gall (1975) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Failhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an alternate theory: about 10% of developers can actually start something from scratch because they truly understand how things work (not that they always do it, but they could if needed). Another 40% can get the daily job done by copying and pasting code from local sources, Stack Overflow, GitHub, or an LLM—while kinda knowing what’s going on. That leaves 50% who don’t really know much beyond a few LeetCode puzzles and have no real grasp of what they’re copying and pasting.Given that distribution, I’d guess that well over 50% of Makefiles are just random chunks of copied and pasted code that kinda work. If they’re lifted from something that already works, job done—next ticket.I’m not blaming the tools themselves. Makefiles are well-known and not too verbose for smaller projects. They can be a bad choice for a 10,000-file monster—though I’ve seen some cleanly written Makefiles even for huge projects. Personally, it wouldn’t be my first choice. That said, I like Makefiles and have been using them on and off for at least 30 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make and Makefiles are incredibly simple when they are not autogenerated by autoconf. If they are generated by autoconf, don’t modify them, they are a build artifact. But also, ditch autoconf if you can.In the broader sense: yes this effect is very real. You can fall to it or you can exploit it. How I exploit it: write a bit of code (or copy/paste it from somewhere). Use it in a project. Refine as needed. When starting the next project, copy that bit of code in. Modify for the second project. See if changes can be backported to the original project. Once both are running and are in sync, extract the bit of code and make it into a library. Sometimes this takes more projects to distill the thing into what a library should be. In the best case, open source the library so others can use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42663231</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incredibly cool. I am constantly amazed by these efforts and the find my network is a really impressive thing. What’s stopped me from using anything like this ever is the fact that I’m confident that at some point Apple will either embrace this sort of piggybacking on the network and open it up more officially, or it will ban any Apple ID that has ever been associated with such things. Right now they know about this and are not commenting either way.Hope in the future either Apple supports this more officially, or there is a way to use it with no direct link to my Apple ID or account. Until then, I am a spectator in these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Story time. My wife and I were vacationing in Portugal last summer. She left her purse in a uber car on the way to the airport. The driver found the purse and dumped it after taking 20$ and some costume jewellery. We tracked it to an abandoned parking lot later that day using an AirTag and we ended up finding it using the Location app. We have AirTags in every bag now and we change the batteries on a schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope in the future we can determine the position of beacons to within a cubic metre or less.My wife has ADD and she loses items often. Tiles aren't very loud and are flaky, we don't have an iPhone to use Airtags. I'm too exhausted to try to master the math needed to locate Bluetooth beacons, but I wish I could. I'd love for there to be a "just add 4 small Bluetooth boards" kind of software project, but it doesn't seem to scratch that itch for most open source devs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42665367</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've burnt out. It was horrible. I am doing much better now!The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.In many places if you get hurt/burnt out on the job the upper seats are looking for any reason to curb stomp you. There's no reason to give a company your all unless you have an actual stake in it or they are there to hold you up when you're dragging. I've worked at multiple places where influential people died, yes dead, below average life expectancy, - on the job - and corporate did everything they could to not even pay out on their legal obligations (life insurance, D&amp;D). In some cases employees joked or snickered about the person who died later on - in meetings.In tech. I've found that you're not on your own but you are at the mercy of who is in charge of your schedule and rates your performance. If you lose trust in that person your best option is to leave as quickly as possible. Otherwise they will do what they can to destroy you for as much 'profit' as they can claim. Being clear. It is not about realized gains, it could even be at great detriment to a company. It is about short-term line item claimable gains. "We got 4 good months out of her...", "they were terminal and now they will be working somewhere better for them...", "he really wasn't closing as many tickets as the rest of the team...", "they weren't helping as many team members as the rest of the team...", "we never needed someone with an advanced degree...", etc.Check in with yourself regularly. Know the signs of burn out. The company you work for does not depend on any person caring about you in the slightest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My theory on burnout is that it arises when the effort you put in doesn't have a meaningful impact because of misalignment or a lack of autonomy. It's like pushing on a lever but the gears are jammed. You're asked to push and push harder, but nobody in a position of power is willing to fix the damn gears.I've worked harder than imaginable in my life on projects without burning out, because the work was incredibly fulfilling — and it fit well with my core beliefs, interests, values. And then I've burnt out from putting tons of unrecognized effort into projects where I lacked adequate leverage to change things.People won't always look after you and burnout can be hard to recover from — harder than you might think. So take care of yourself — and never stop looking for work that aligns with your core values, interests, and the kind of life you want to build.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My own conclusion about burnout is that it fundamentally comes down to who controls the agenda, and how much you invest in that agenda.  I've been burned out.  Many years ago, early in my career.  My cure: I was in the lucky position that it was a good time to spend a year and half going back to school to knock off a graduate degree that simultaneously moved my career forward, gave me a total change of scenery, and gave me some break time between leaving the job and starting classes, time that I devoted 100% to hobbies and home improvement projects.  And of course, an easy-to-tell story when reentering the job market.So on the topic of agenda... if what you are working on is your own agenda, you don't burn out.  You might change the agenda by redefining goals, but in the end, you are sailing your own ship.  Not only do you not burn out, it is curative.  It is when you absorb someone else's agenda and make it your own to an unhealthy extent that you burn out.  Always be computing that dot product between your employer's agenda vector and your own agenda vector.  Don't over-invest beyond that dot-product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645859</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "De-smarting the Marshall Uxbridge" discusses the implications and challenges of simplifying the UI/UX of the Marshall Uxbridge smart speaker. It examines the balance between maintaining essential smart features while making the device more user-friendly for those who may not be tech-savvy. The author argues that a simplified interface could enhance user experience without significantly compromising functionality, enabling broader accessibility and appeal for users who prefer straightforward devices. The piece highlights user feedback and potential design solutions to achieve this aim.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're going through all the effort to design a PCB have you thought about driving the I2S input digitally? I skimmed through the AD85050 datasheet and it has internal DSP functionality which would have been already tuned for the drivers and box by Marshall. The reason powered boxes sound decent despite their relatively cheap hardware is because of the extensive processing they have in the background to compensate for any hardware defiencies.As the AD85050 has a stereo I2S input there's a possibility for the actual crossover to be either done on the amp chip itself (with the same signal driving both channels) or done on the Amlogic SOC. The latter would be ugly as you would need another DSP chip on your board to do the crossover functionality, or perhaps you could program the AD85050 via I2C to add the appropiate low and high pass filters.A two channel A/D converter would work on the front end, as you could drive both channels with a single analog input to get a stereo I2S out with duplicate channels to drive the amp. A USB input would be much messier if you want true stereo using two speakers unless you plan on doing routing on the software side. With SPDIF you probably could get away with splitting the signal and using a SPDIF to I2S converter chip in each speaker, but you would still need some way to separate out the left and right channels. The AD85050 has mixing functionality via I2C which may help with that.And of course, all this might be more work than desigining an amp in the first place, and it really depends if you want to explore the analog or digital side of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have this speaker and cannot believe how annoying the smart features are. I'll be talking on the phone in my apartment and the speaker will think I'm trying to prompt it."SORRY. YOUR DEVICE IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. PLEASE CHECK YOUR BLUETOOTH SETTINGS AND TRY AGAIN." (at max volume!)It's unbelievable. I'm not an EE, but would love to know how I can disable these incredible unsmart features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lately I've been wondering if there's a way to do this to Smart TVs. Personally, I like the name "stupify" better ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666572</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of PVS (Potentially Visible Set) portals in the Quake engine to manage visibility and optimize rendering in 3D environments. It explains how portals function by segmenting spaces to determine which areas are visible from a given point, thereby reducing rendering load. The piece also covers the implementation of these portals in Quake, detailing technical aspects and offering insights into how they improve performance in complex game levels. Overall, it highlights the significance of effective visibility management in game design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting with Quake II, designers were able to place "area portals" which are portals programmers could toggle at runtime (think disabling a doorway portal when the door is closed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I recall Prey being the first game to hype portals for rendering, though I think theirs may have been for drawing not just culling? Does anyone know how it worked?Dark Forces apparently also used portals for culling, IIRC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42661185</guid></item><item><title>7.

End of sentence should be &lt;|im_end|&gt; not &lt;|endoftext|&gt;2. Chat template should not auto add an assistant prompt3. Padding token should not be EOS but &lt;|dummy_87|&gt;I also converted Phi-4 to Llama-arch. I uploaded GGUFs, 4bit quants, dynamic quants and all fixes to https://huggingface.co/unslothI also made a Colab notebook to finetune Phi-4 on a free GPU: https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Update: The Phi-4 team is actively working on adding all our fixes into the original model! https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4/discussions/21&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi. It's nice to see these fixes.I got a question after checking results on the open LLM leaderboard[1].Comparing the result of NyxKrage/Microsoft_Phi-4 and microsoft/phi-4 or unsloth/phi-4, I can see fixing both the tokenizer and chat template causes the performance of both IFEval and BBH to increase. However, the performance on MATH, GPQA and MUSR degrades A LOT.Is there any explanation on why this is happening?[1] https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660335</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Stellar work. The TS looks really proper on first glance. I think you're right on zeitgeist -- we're going to need a lot more fundamental tools like this to build AI apps.Technically speaking, I've long wondered about mount/unmount of components as panels are dragged about and their visibility changed. Sometimes it's more costly to mount/unmount than to display:none.Second, you have basically a declarative structure for these panels, are there plans to expose a Vite plugin for example that could export saved TS layouts, where functions (ie: TS imports) map to the panel contents? (trying to think outside of JSX and more vanilla TS)Fantastic work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare to golden layout?  Inspired by it?I really enjoyed that project back in the day, but unfortunately support completely stopped (it had some folks take over, but I didn't see a real feasible upgrade path despite their passionate work on updating it).This looks great!  I'd be interested in giving it a try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I maintain a tiling wm written in Rust, and I just cannot imagine having the patience to do this kind of work in JS/TS. My respect to mathuo!

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of Ruby's lazy enumerators, showcasing a simple technique to enhance understanding of their functionality. It describes how lazy enumerators allow for efficient data processing by creating enumerables that compute values on demand, rather than generating all values at once. The author provides practical examples and code snippets to illustrate how lazy enumerators can be utilized to improve performance in Ruby applications, emphasizing their usefulness in handling large datasets and optimizing memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I learned Haskell in college I was blown away by how laziness enables cool things like dealing with infinite lists or more performance even though the UX is exactly the same. (Apparently with Ruby there is the slight hint of adding the lazy method in between)Later I found out laziness in the whole system by default leads to some difficult issues, which quite a few people seem to agree with. Simon Peyton Jones (Haskell co-creator) apparently has said "The next Haskell will be strict". (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14011943)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So in Ruby, `map` and `select` are eager-by-default, but you can just write `lazy.map().select()` to make the whole chain lazy? That's really nice - much better than Python 2, which was also eager-by-default and you had to change every function call to make it lazy (`map` =&gt; `imap`, `filter` =&gt; `ifilter`).Python 3 changed to being lazy-by-default. I assume that improves CPU/memory usage, but in some cases it does have less predictable behaviour. I can see why Ruby, with its goal of "developer happiness", would choose to retain the predictable behaviour of eager-by-default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently Typescript doesn’t have anything built-in like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639581</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For no specific reason other than life random offers I've gone through a few of those "dead and bad" reputational language in my career (VB6, Delphi, PHP), mostly as a case of "there is a lot of money being a decent programmer who can use these correctly".And there are three things I learned about it1. There is a lot more money in it than you would think. The good part of "there is a lot of newbie using it" is that there is a lot of newbie using it and tons of software in it out there, and once you prove you know what you're doing you drown in high paid work, and with a bit of job selection it's not the bad horrible maintenance kind but decent fun too.2. There is no need trying to argue with people about it online or whatever. You're not going to convince anyone they're better language than they think. PHP 8 is a top notch language and people are still dumping on it using php 4 things.3. Ultimately there are people who spend their time talking about what language is right and people who get things done, build something great and it doesn't matter if it's cpp or Javascript or whatever. So at the end of day I've made a fair bit of money improving or building stuff used by lots of people to generate tons of revenue, and everyone involved is happy about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using XYplorer for 10 years now and it's fantastic. There are just so many features and quality of life improvements over the Windows explorer.It's written by a single person, and they're very responsive. I've recently reported a bug with the search (the first that I've noticed in all those years), and it's been fixed within a day. I'm only worried about the bus factor a little.I have a GitHub repo with some of my settings/scripts/notes for XYplorer if someone's interested: https://github.com/darekkay/config-files/tree/master/xyplore...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think VB is totally fine. It's a pragmatic solution to a real problem, and the ugliest things about it today are all a product of hindsight.On the other hand, this rubs me the wrong way:&gt; So, wouldn’t it be logical to conclude: If such an application can be written in VB6 then VB6 cannot be that bad after all?Yes, it absolutely could be bad. Our industry consists, in no small part, of turd polishing. Plenty of good software is written in bad (or ill-fitted) languages, and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623387</guid></item><item><title>12.

Sometimes, the most expedient choice isn't the best one.If you're ever downtown, checkout the Chihuly installations in the main library. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fiesta-tower&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grew in San Antonio as well and one of the best parts about the Riverwalk is that it offers a fantastic pedestrian corridor across almost the entirety of downtown San Antonio and connects a lot of really interesting places, The missions down south, Pearl Brewery and it's shopping district, downtown mall and Convention center as well as La Villita and The Art Museum.Sure you can walk the streets but getting around via the Riverwalk is actually extremely pleasant. I really love how convinient of a convention city San Antonio is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting and refreshing choice to stick to a pure textual description without the usual torrent of photos. Needs frequent looking up of terms though :-)As for the river walk itself, living in Amsterdam predisposes you to treat the bone-dry, car infested asphalt and concrete jungles we call cities as weird places where humanity aggregates for ritualistic suffering. Discovering that San Antonio is different was a great and pleasant surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42628248</guid></item><item><title>13.

I read the article on my RSS, and then immediately hopped over to HN just so I could upvote.&gt; Fortunately though, over the course of Bauble’s development, I had produced a comprehensive suite of test scripts with reference images that demonstrated all of the edge cases and problems that I had faced and already fixed and… No, of course not. I can’t even type that with straight fingers. There were no tests.Intensely relatable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading this, I am now of the belief that software is, actually, a good thing. And that programming can be enjoyable.Seriously, this does such a good job of capturing the feeling of MAGIC that code is capable of -- both in its process and in its output. Textbook "craft". It's hard to experience that sometimes when surrounded by dependency hell, environments, build systems, certain dynamic programming languages, and the modern web ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been here for 15 years.  This is the most interesting project and writeup I have ever seen here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660942</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The Wends of Texas refers to a group of Slavic immigrants, primarily from the Lusatia region of eastern Germany, who settled in Texas in the mid-19th century. They were drawn by the promise of land and opportunity, significantly impacting the area's cultural development. The Wends maintained their unique cultural practices, language, and traditions, particularly in the community of Serbin, Texas. Over time, assimilation into American society led to a decline in the use of their native language, though efforts continue to preserve their heritage. The site provides detailed information on their history, cultural practices, and contributions to Texas's identity.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the things I found interesting was that there was a local paper that printed articles in German, English, and Wendish (Sorbian) – there’s a link in the Wiki article.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress, took action to deactivate the accounts of several contributors who were planning to create a fork of WordPress. This decision came amid tensions within the community regarding the direction and governance of the platform. Mullenweg's move sparked debates about innovation versus adherence to the original project, as well as the implications for contributors who wish to pursue alternative development paths. The situation highlights the challenges of managing open-source projects and the complexities involved in balancing community interests with leadership decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been contributing for 20 years to the project, am a committer, and built several large parts of WordPress including the REST API.Matt is banning anyone who speaks out at all, even when they agree with points he’s made. A large group of contributors felt they had to make an anonymous statement from fear of the same retribution I suffered: https://www.therepository.email/core-contributors-voice-conc...(I am a less active direct contributor these days, so I’m still able to contribute even while blocked - but many people’s livelihoods depend on it, as sponsored contributors.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TechCrunch headline is not accurate. As far as I understand, none of the people whose WordPress accounts were deactivated were planning a fork.The current top comment and discussion on this Reddit thread provide good context:https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1hylx50/matt_tro...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From Mullenweg (https://wordpress.org/news/2025/01/jkpress/):&gt; To make this easy and hopefully give this project the push it needs to get off the ground, I’m deactivating the .org accounts of Joost, Karim, Se Reed, Heather Burns, and Morten Rand-Hendriksen. I strongly encourage anyone who wants to try different leadership models or align with WP Engine to join up with their new effort.He seems to be justifying the deactivation by claiming it will 'help them', somehow?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42667766</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "Very Wrong Math," Charles Petzold discusses the complexities and misconceptions surrounding mathematical concepts often encountered in the context of computer science. He emphasizes the importance of clarity in mathematical reasoning and argues that oversimplified or incorrect interpretations can lead to significant misunderstandings in both theoretical and practical applications. Petzold uses examples to illustrate common pitfalls in mathematical logic and encourages readers to approach math with rigor and precision to avoid these errors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have seen a very similar (incorrect) argument used to justify the idea of a flat earth.  A builder on youtube made the argument (with a similar out of scale drawing of the earth) that if he drops a plumb bob and makes a right angle so he has a straight horizontal line and then goes across that line for a bit and drops another plumb bob, the two lines he has dropped are parallel, "proving" that the surface of the earth must be parallel to the horizontal line and therefore flat and not curved.  If the earth's surface was actually curved he argued then the two lines he has dropped should tilt slightly inward towards each other.  Which of course they do. The earth is just much much much bigger than in the diagram so the effect is within the margin of error for the measurement he was taking.As a meta point, our intuition often fails us hilariously when we are dealing with stuff that is out of the scale we have commonly seen in our lives. We joke about LLMs hallucinating but I'm not convinced we are so superior when we are outside our personal "training data".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_girdling_Earth#Implicat....The takeaway is that the extra length of the arc is likely much smaller than one would intuitively expect. The problem is usually framed like so: If you wrapped a rope around the earth, how much more rope would you need to add so that it would be 1 meter above the ground at all points? The answer is only 2π meters!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if the math of the arc length was correct (and you don't need to be a math professor to figure out it isn't) there's another logic misstep.Implied in the caption is that the speed is the same at all heights (given that an increase in distance is implied as an increase in time.)This is again obvious nonsense - speed is a function of thrust versus drag, and it's safe to say that both of those are affected by air density.It becomes even less true once one gets to space. There height is a function of speed which means that to "catch up" something in front of you, you need to slow down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42661432</guid></item><item><title>18. 17th-century priory in France converted into a medieval-inspired topiary garden</title><link>https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/gallery/prieure-de-vauboin-garden</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;English spelling could be significantly improved by adding a few optional accents. They could be purely additive: the ASCII spellings would remain valid for those who prefer to use them.Native English speakers don’t seem to quite grasp how difficult the spelling is. I’ve been using this language for thirty years and I sometimes forget how some basic words are pronounced because I mostly write it.There’s no need to change physical keyboards. In the smartphone era, most English around the world is already being typed using soft keyboards and autocomplete. A spelling reform could be agreed between Google, Apple and Microsoft. They are the de facto equivalent of Académie Française for the English language, even if they don’t use that power.Here’s my basic suggestion for the optional accent marks:A long vowel is marked with an acute accent. The sound is simply the one you’re familiar with from how the alphabet is pronounced. This lets us distinguish between léad (the verb) and lead (the metal), live (the verb) and líve (as in streaming), lów and how, féar and bear, bléak and break, infinite and fíníte, etc.It also fixes the spelling of many loan words that look like the final e would be silent and today you just have to know it’s not: catastrophé, epitomé, Eurydicé, etc.This easy rule doesn’t nearly cover all the weird vowel spellings, but it already fixes a substantial part of the worst obstacles for English learners.Two more accent marks could be deployed:The macron is already familiar to Japanese learners. It’s a long version of the short vowel sound, as in Ōsaka. The spelling of many English loan words could be unified by deploying the macron consistently. It would allow replacing é with ē in French loan words like fiancē.The grave accent could be used to assign a third vowel sound, but it’s not as obvious what this should be. As an example, maybe for the letter A, it could be the sound in words like àll and hàul and àwe. Again, the point would be to give a consistent and useful hint of a sound that doesn’t follow the basic rules, not to make the spelling perfect in one stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading and writing are different transformations - they are not complementary or inverse - they are just different.Phonics gives you some clues to remember a word, context gives you other clues. Eventually, you may learn what kinds of words come from Latin, Greek, and French, and those are more clues. But before those clues do anything at all for you, you have to care and want to read.Four righting ewe jest halve two remmemmber thee spellin.&gt; "There's an idea about how children learn to read that's held sway in schools for more than a generation — even though it was proven wrong by cognitive scientists decades ago.

Can she reclaim her good name?"Gift link: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/12/lucy-ca...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really, English is sort of a patchwork quilt. English spelling starts making sense if you also know the spelling of several of the source languages it borrowed from. French especially important; Latin and Greek via french IIRC; and maybe German and Dutch or so for the Saxon side of things.The confusion happens when (Anglo)-Saxon, French, and Greek words all happen to collide.Or I would say that, but then I looked at one of the first given examples: Corpse and Corps, not actually from two different languages. Actually borrowed from Latin "corpus" (body) via french twice .  [1]You still get quite a bit of traction if you know those other languages, but ... that one is particularly bad!See also: Ghoti (Supposedly can validly be pronounced "Fish")* "Gh" = /f/ (laugh)  : A sound that doesn't exist in english anymore, but does in german" "Lach", which is pronounced roughly the same as in old english). Or, if you want a word you might recognize: "Loch", which is the Scottish Gaelic word for Lake.* "O" = /ɪ/ (women) : Actually english, from the great vowel shift I think?* "Ti" = /ʃ/ (nation) : Nation is actually a french word, borrowed wholesale including the original spelling.

We know we will have N3 GPU next year, and they should be working with TSMC on capacity planning for N2. Currently Blackwell is pretty much limited by capacity of either TSMC, HBM or packaging. And unless the AI hype dies off soon ( which I doubt will happen ), we should still have at least another 5 years of these GPU improvements. We will have another 5 - 10x performance increase.And they have foreshadowed their PC entry with MediaTek Partnership. ( I wonder why they dont just acquired Mediatek ) and may be even Smartphone or Tablet with Geforce GPU IP.The future is exciting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related ongoing thread:Ask HN: Pull the curtain back on Nvidia's CES keynote please - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808 - Jan 2025 (2 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Nvidia Project Digits looked rather interesting.

Initializing it globally in this code would result in the compiler generating some instructions to be run before main() is called, which we can’t very easily patch into the original binary.Assuming your increase the size of the binary, change the first instruction to jump to the end of the program, do your magic, perform the original first instruction, and finally jump to the second instruction. If the program itself does not self modify or otherwise examine its own size, this would get you to the original start with your modifications applied.&gt; In the end, it took about 8 hours to get this project finished, which was spread out over multiple weeks.That’s incredible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't enable code protection on the PIC.If I were in need of a mod like this, I'd just wire another switch in parallel to control the appropriate solenoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645415</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Moravec's Paradox is often misapplied when considering LLMs vs. robotics. It's true that formal reasoning over unambiguous problem representations is easy and computationally cheap. Lisp machines were already doing this sort of thing in the '70s. But the kind of commonsense reasoning over ambiguous natural language that LLMs can do is not easy or computationally cheap. Many early AI researchers thought it would be — that it would just require a bit of elaboration on the formal reasoning stuff — but this was totally wrong.So, it doesn't make sense to say that what LLMs do is Moravec-easy, and therefore can't be extrapolated to predict near-term progress on Moravec-hard problems like robotics. What LLMs do is, in fact, Moravec-hard. And we should expect that if we've got enough compute to make major progress on one Moravec-hard problem, there's a good chance we're closing in on having enough to make major progress on others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh weird to wake up to see something I wrote more than half year ago (and posted on HN with no traction) getting reposted now.Glad to see so many different takes on it. It was written in slight jest as a discussion starter with my ML/neuroscience coworker and friends, so it's actually very insightful to see some rebuttals.Initial post was twice the length, and had several more (in retrospect) interesting points. First ever blog post so reading it now fills me with cringe.Some stuff have changed in only half year, so will see if the points stands the test of time ;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Moravec’s paradox is the observation by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky, and others in the 1980s.I have a name for it now!I've said over and over that there are only two really hard problems in robotics: Perception and funding.  A perfectly perceived system and world can be trivially planned for and (at least proprio-)controlled. Imagine having a perfect intuition about other actors such that you know their paths (in self driving cars), or your map is a perfect voxel + trajectory + classification. How divine!It's limited information and difficulties in reducing signal to concise representation that always get ya. This is why the perfect lab demos always fail - there's a corner case not in your training data, or the sensor stuttered or became misaligned, or etc etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623255</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way I remember it: A* can find shortest path between any two given points; Djikstras can precompute the shortest path between a single point and all other points; And Floyd-Warshall can precompute the shortest path between all possible pairs of points.The author starts with Djikstras and updates the precomputed path-map every frame that either the players location changes or an obstacle is added.Maybe some more performance can be squeezed out. If the player's location changes more frequently than obstacles are added, it may be worthwhile to precompute the all-pairs-shortest-path (floyd-warshall) which would instead only need to be updated on obstacle additions. The precomputed path map would no longer need to be updated on player location changes.A similar trick can probably be used to efficiently update the precomputed APSP path-map in these cases, since only a single obstacle is added at a time.Though if obstacles are added fairly frequently relative to player location changes, this is probably not worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pathfinding is a profoundly interesting problem. I think it is very impressive that Starcraft II still has amazing lag-free pathfinding that beats or matches basically every game out there, including very recent RTS games like Stormgate and Zerospace that have a specific emphasis on smooth mechanics for competitive play. Like you can build all kinds of buildings and a zillion zerglings will instantly go around them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Couldn’t you just do a breadth first flood fill from the player every time the environment changes? Would be O(n) where n is total number of cells, which would be fast on any hardware or in the browser.You’d still want to use the directional chart idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42661761</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores a fictional scenario in which Pablo Picasso is arrested for the theft of the Mona Lisa, blending historical context with imaginative storytelling. It examines Picasso's art and his relationship with theft in the context of creativity, as well as the cultural significance of the Mona Lisa. Through this narrative, the piece reflects on the intersection of art, crime, and identity, ultimately probing deeper philosophical questions about ownership and the nature of artistic genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the concept of shell holes in the context of Reed's model for analyzing rectangular shells subjected to various loading conditions. It provides a detailed mathematical approach to understanding the effects of these holes on shell structures, including derivations, theoretical frameworks, and numerical examples. The findings are aimed at improving the design and analysis of shell-type structures in engineering, focusing on the mechanical implications of imperfections introduced by hole formations.&lt;/p&gt;

I told them that this is really a bad idea, and they pulled up one of their setup guides with "enhanced security hardening".It ended up with ~35 specific entries for binaries in sudoers, one of them being /usr/sbin/setcap - which allows you to give e.g. the Python interpreter CAP_SETUID, making a privilege escalation to root trivial again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loopholes of this kind exist these days as well.When I was working for a major retailer, who, you'd assume would have thought about these things well enough, you were prevented from executing sudo, except for being able to use it for text editing (sudo vi). I needed to install some packages with a root shell at the time, so I used the command execution feature within vi to get that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting aside all of the technical aspects of this, the history of this in the world of UNIX, I just love the process and bureaucracy that generated this specific paper document.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses significant flaws in the implementations of binary search and merge sort algorithms, which are widely used in computer science. Researchers from Google found that nearly all existing implementations of these algorithms contain subtle bugs that can lead to incorrect results. The blog highlights the importance of robust and error-free algorithm design and invites the community to adopt safer and more reliable coding practices to prevent common pitfalls associated with these essential algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally it's just a little excessive to try to solve the halting problem in a library's unit tests ;). You don't have to test a program for all possible inputs, only for all materially unique state transitions. In a binary search, each variable can be zero, one, some(*), max, overflowed. The combination of these is not infinite as the values of some that cause different behavior is much more reasonable when grouped into chunks of the same behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This bug, and many others, can be detected with a trivial amount of formal verification. I really think formal verification should see much wider use for things that see as much use as standard libraries, even if it's just for the trivial things like overflow and out-of-bounds access.In the below code we can see a formal verification tool (GNATProve) detect both the original error and the out-of-bounds access that it causes. Doing the arithmetic using a larger type clears both reported errors without the need for any additional annotations for GNATProve.    function Search (A : A_Type; Target : Integer) return Integer is
       Left : Integer := A'First;
       Right : Integer := A'Last;
    begin
       while Left &lt;= Right loop
          declare
             Mid : Integer := (Left + Right) / 2;
          begin
             if A (Mid) = Target then
                return Mid;
             elsif A (Mid) &lt; Target then
                Left := Mid + 1;
             elsif A (Mid) &gt; Target then
                Right := Mid - 1;
             end if;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of configuration languages, emphasizing the importance of elegance in their design and usability. It explores various characteristics that contribute to an elegant configuration language, such as clarity, simplicity, and expressiveness. The author compares different existing languages, highlighting how they meet or fail to meet these criteria while advocating for a more refined approach to designing configuration languages that enhance user experience and effectiveness in configuration management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a lot of words to describe a very simple syntax: name=value pairs, with line continuation using whitespace.Basically RFC822 email headers, or Debian Control File Format [0] but with "=" instead of ":", and without dedicated comment character.The biggest problem with this format is that a lot of things are left for the app, so each app will have its own way to implement lists, bools, line wrap support.. Even something like "value override" is left to program implementation. Don't expect YAML/JSON/XML-style automated validators/linters, each program will need its own bespoke parser/generator.[0] https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.ht...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the conciseness of this syntax. The language seems very well thought through.That being said, I've been working with NixOS recently and it's made me reconsider what is useful for a configuration language. In many reasonably large software projects, where configs become very complex, config reuse (in other words templating or meta-configuration) becomes an increasingly helpful feature. Nix configs are great because it's not just a config, but a full blown purely functional language for manipulating the config. It's intuitive and powerful once you get the hang of it, and I sometimes find myself wishing I could use it when I have to work with yaml, json, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone is entitled to scratch their own itch, but this seems like the most useless configuration language I've ever seen.Take the "fixed point" example, where you have a boolean setting which one file says should should be "yes" and the other says it should be "no" and the language semantics composes that into a list with both values. For what boolean setting does this make sense?The article says "Overrides are not a problem because you keep both values. And you can decide what to do with them: keep only the first, keep only the last or use some smart logic to combine both of them. You’re the boss."If you need custom logic in your application determine the setting to use, how is this language helping you?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42615006</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh dear. I've been trying to get people to not use this feature for a while.One thing that has bitten me in the past is that, if you declare your associative arrays within a function, that associative array is ALWAYS global.
Even if you declare it with `local -A` it will still be global.
Despite that, you cannot pass an associative array to a function by value.  I say "by value" because while you can't call `foo ${associative_array}` and pick it up in foo with `local arg=$1, you can pass it "by reference" with `foo associative_array` and pick it up in foo with `local -n arg=$1`, but if you give the passed in dereferenced variable a name that is already used in the global scope, it will blow up, eg `local -n associative_array=$1`.As a general rule for myself when writing bash, if I think one of my colleagues who has an passable knowledge of bash will need to get man pages out to figure out what my code is doing, the bash foo is too strong and it needs to be dumbed down or re-written in another language.  Associative arrays almost always hit this bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s amazing how much of a superpower merely reading the manual is nowadays.&lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Arrays&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not only do they exist, but they have some fantastic foot guns! https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#A.5B.5B_-v_hash.5B....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631815</guid></item><item><title>30.

I can not think of a worse thing to do to your code in terms of readability and future maintainability. Maybe it is OK if you use an IDE to identify types for you but I still hate it. I am trying to learn a new library right now with light documentation which means reading the code, and between typedefs, auto, and technical debt, it is a tedious exercise to figure out something's type, to go look up its function, to see what type that is returning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes me wonder when '_' was first used as a token to denote unused information.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worth noting if someone uses this to share private data: Checking the "Private torrent" would tell your and compliant clients to not use DHT and other public methods that can leak the content. But it doesn't stop other non-compliant clients from sharing it on the DHT once they have it, nor does it stop someone from just ticking "Enable DHT" on their side once they have received it (or change "private" to "false" in the torrent file itself).Obvious to many I'm sure, but maybe best to be explicit about it anyways.Slightly off-topic but kind of fitting: How does infohash v2 support look like today? It's been available for years, but seemingly most private trackers + most other places seems to still be using v1. What clients are people using today, do those support v2? As far as I know, all modern clients do, so it would be possible to start using v2 exclusively.Reason for the question is that I'm planning to distribute many large files to the public, and in my experience, BitTorrent works really well for that. Question is if it's enough to just publish v2 infohashes, or I need to publish both v1 and v2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this. I continue to believe Torrenting is the best way to share files, particularly big files, rather than uploading them to some cloud instance with questionable privacy policies…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a self-hostable BitTorrent tracker that can run with Docker? I know there's an option on qBittorrent but I don't want my server to run a full BitTorrent client; just the tracker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42664409</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a minor thing but I would remove the jQuery dependency. You're not doing much with that plain javascript couldn't do just as well if not better. Plain JS has come a long way since jQuery first came out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; there are many log services available and this is my attempt at a better one.Out of curiosity, can you describe how your service is better than others?&gt;I hope my application fixes most of these issuesDo you care to elaborate on the "how"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious about the open source nature of this and how you / people in general manage a project where you are hosting it and need to maintain its security, but are also presumably merging pull requests as people contribute to the project. I would be quite paranoid about this, ie concerned that someone might slip a line of code in with the intent of breaching the service that I would not catch during code review. I know this is true of any open source project but it feels especially fraught when you are also hosting it and letting people sign up and pay for it. I’m wondering if you or others have experience with this and what approaches and practices mitigate this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666139</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the essay, the author (David Mason) quotes the beginning of Cinderella. I agree with Mason about the beauty of the terse prose here:&gt; So much is conveyed here about character, time and the natural world, because Cinderella’s piety is natural piety, respect for nature more than conventional Christian belief.It's something that modern fantasy usually doesn't capture, by being too modern, and by being far too verbose. The latter is one aspect in which Tolkien's Simarillion feels better than his "The Lord of the Rings": The Simarillion leaves all the details out, it has little direct speech, and only mentions what's important. Its style is not as raw and authentic as in Grimm's fairy tales, or as in actual historical legends like King Arthur, but it gets close as times, mainly by avoiding the verbosity that is so common in all modern literature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42638706</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the rising tide of loneliness in American society, exploring its roots in personality, politics, and social dynamics. It discusses how changes in interpersonal relationships, driven by factors like technology and individualism, contribute to feelings of isolation. The piece also highlights the alarming implications of loneliness on mental health and political behavior, suggesting that this pervasive issue may have deep-seated effects on the fabric of American life, influencing everything from voter turnout to civic engagement. Ultimately, the article calls for a deeper understanding of loneliness as a critical social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of people who are lonely and wish they had something to do means that when I ask someone to coffee, drinks, or just to hangout, chances are they'll say yes. I'm an active member of one of my city's discord servers, so there's a substantial pool to draw from. I've organized in person book clubs, movie nights, and group coffee outings, all from the same pool.More recently, I've engaged with my city's kink community which has no shortage of public socials. I'm at the point where I have to be choosy about how I want to spend my time because it's easy to get over booked.Maybe I have higher initiative than most, but I found the experience to be dependent on how much effort I put into it and incredibly rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think old distinction between the words "unsociable" meaning not wanting to socialise, and "anti-social" meaning causing trouble to society, is useful. I guess I'm swimming against the tide with this one though&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662340</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly free speech for me is one of those services still (excellently) run by nerds.Its no-frills, functional UI reminds me of the old internet before services and sites began coalescing into bigger, faceless, soulless monoliths. I didn’t know about this policy before today, but now I love them even more.If you’re looking for a place to host your next project or domain, I can’t recommend them enough!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This relies on an EA adjacent market fallacy where we can resolve all moral action down to funding actors of various moral alignments - there's no reason to believe that the end utility (or whatever metric) of the action is linear w.r.t amount of cash moved.Garage band EvilWebsite.com is going to appreciate that 5$ way more than the SPLC or whatever.This isn't to say that the policy is strictly bad, I just worry that it reinforces pretty negative patterns. Carbon offsets barely work, and that's an actual market - bigotry offsets are a dark line to walk.(edit - misread the policy; it's not about matching cash flows through the service to offending websites, it's donating profits from offending costumers. That seems more consistent to me.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is kinda neat.&gt; 2. The recipient organization is as opposite (and hopefully as offensive) as possible to the site operator that funded the donation.This is vulnerable to "false flag" abuse, from faux-morons.&gt; 1. The recipient organization does share our values.This partly mitigates that risk.Faux-morons can still generate more funds for recipients chosen by the site, and/or hurt the profitability of the site, but at least it's for causes within the values of the site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42663923</guid></item><item><title>40.

(I suspect you can do simpler than the paper's solution if you're only interested in the top-k.)A related topic is "token healing", although some implementations (unfortunately including the one in HuggingFace Transformers) make some big assumptions that aren't always true (like treating spaces as special).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Can you construct an efficient algorithm for sampling from q(tk∣t1,…,tk−1), that minimizes calls to the original language model?I feel like I'm missing some issue here... Can't you query stopping at the last full token boundary, then reject any results which don't match the character prefix and continue from there with the completion? Kind of like when you mask the invalid actions when reinforcement training on games? Or is that losing too much info?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is harder than it looks.First "token-healing" doesn't work. Consider the case "app" where the most likely options are "ap|praisal" or "apple|sauce". You can't just sample all tokens that start with app, or you'd miss appraisal.Second, it's easy to come up with a naive algorithm that samples from the true distribution. It's very difficult to make this algorithm efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632478</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent a number of years designing outer-runner direct drive permanent magnet motors for industrial equipment and I've got some questions.Cheifly, bearings. They're not shown in any of the oh-wow images, but these will likely be the most expensive component of each motor. Big bearings are expensive, and to accept the loading of normal wheel operation, these will have to be pretty beefy. That's not even discussing operational life and maintenance.After you've stuffed a pair of angular contact roller bearings into this "wheel", you're going to want to keep salt water and road grime from entering those bearings, so what do you use as a seal? Whatever you use is going to be big, expensive, and suck up huge amounts of power due to the large contact surface.Finally, once you've got big ass bearings and big ass seals, how do you have enough room to put a decent amount of copper in there? Power in these things always amounts to maximizing the amount of copper in the space, and I just don't see room for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first I was like "this is crazy, those are going to be crazy expensive, they'll never make it" and then I realized we're not the customers, at least not willinglyhttps://www.donutdefence.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More on their design can be found in their patents, https://patents.google.com/?assignee=verge+motorcycles&amp;oq=as...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's personal experiences with narcolepsy, highlighting its unusual symptoms and the impact it has on daily life. The author shares anecdotes that illustrate the often misunderstood aspects of the condition, such as unexpected sleep episodes and the challenges of functioning in a world that doesn't always recognize or accommodate those living with narcolepsy. Ultimately, it seeks to shed light on the realities of this neurological disorder, promoting understanding and empathy for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have some of those minor symptoms.One thing I have experienced is lying in bed and being unable to move, and I can't tell why. it seems like I'm just not trying to move, which I think is the feeling that distinguishes it from paralysis.What I have found is I can open my eyes and move them around. Through this I discovered an exercise that helps.  If I focus on the ceiling in the far left side of the room then switch to focusing on the far right, after about 5 to 10 if those switches, the rest of my body can move without issues.  Whatever it was that felt like I was just being lazy simply vanishes.My brain is weirdly configured.   I have had MRIs, catscans,  ultrasounds on though my eye (which is as it sounds,close your eye, pour some goopvon it, then waggle a gadget over the goop)Some of those were before I had Touretts like symptoms turn up.    All I really know at this point is there isn't a tumor in there.  I have a feeling some of my doctors would have placed money on finding one.I also had a thing where they covered me in electrodes and timed how long it took me to fall asleep, then immediately woke me up again to repeat the processSeparately I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on methylphenidate only to find it had no effect on anything (was like taking nothing at all). Now on Dexamphetamine with some benefits.The dramatic difference in how it feels to do something that previously seemed to require insurmountable effort has made me wonder if laziness is not actually a real thing. Those who have not experienced it may feel like you should just put your head down and do the task at hand, but the way the ability or inability to do that seems to switch on and off like a switch really doesn't make it seem like a factor of willpower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My brother has narcolepsy. It is interesting how it presents itself in different people. I have never seen my brother fall asleep while occupied with something (walking, talking...) but I have seen him fall asleep so many times when he is not. 
The moment he gets in a car and it starts driving he falls asleep and very deeply. He would fall asleep in class all the time. The first time i really saw his narcolepsy expressed was during a daytime dinner. He had just had a big meal and while we were all sitting and talking, he just kinda nodded off.The sad part is he has felt quite embarrassed by all this growing up. These are not dangerous situations, but it just feels awkward for a teenager. He also talks and walk in his sleep. Even worse is that no one believed him when he suggested he might have narcolepsy. Our mom is a doctor but figured he was just tired like all young, growing boys. It took a brain scan to get it sorted.He's been prescribed Ritalin or something similar, but manages without.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fascinating. Three years ago, after recovering from COVID, along with many long haul symptoms I developed several similar to but still distinct from narcolepsy. Even now as the CFS-like symptoms have mostly faded, the narcoleptic symptoms are still present. Unfortunately I've not been able to get a positive diagnosis of any sort because it's atypical.There are two main symptoms I experience. First is that, often without any clear provocation, I will become very fatigued and weak. This usually occurs over about 20 minutes, but the initial onset is a distinct event I've come to recognize. It gives many of those same long COVID symptoms: brain fog and drowsiness, weakness to the point of struggling to stand up or keep my head up, uncoordinated movements, and a feeling like I've been up all night and I desperately need to sleep. This often subsides after an hour or two, but it may last several hours.The second which is perhaps just a more extreme case of the first is a complete inability to wake up. I may be slightly aroused and fade in and out of consciousness, but I have no ability to control this. I typically cannot move during this: everything feels so exceptionally tired and heavy that I feel like I don't have the strength to move anything, even to turn my head. Depending on how conscious I am at any moment, I may realize I'm in this situation, or I might imagine that I'm just really tired or depressed and that's why I can't move. These episodes tend to last many hours, often 8 or more. They can happen as an extension of my random bouts of sleepiness, but often they occur as an extension of my normal sleep, resulting in me not being able to wake up - even when physically aroused by someone else - until well into the evening.In both cases the sleep is not restful. Instead I often feel it come on again a few hours later, though less extreme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42653370</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Ford's Mach-E electric vehicle has achieved a significant milestone by outselling the gasoline-powered Mustang for the first time. This shift reflects the growing popularity of electric vehicles and the increasing consumer demand for EVs. The article discusses the implications of this trend for the automotive industry, highlighting Ford's commitment to electrification and the changing landscape of car sales, as more customers opt for electric over traditional combustion engines. The success of the Mach-E indicates a broader movement towards sustainable transportation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gas car is an impractical vanity car, the electric one is a small SUV. Why is this comparison interesting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weird comparison as all they share is a name but still interesting to see how uneducated the car buyers are. EV Mustang is in my honest opinion the worst EV I have driven and I include golf carts and mobility scooters in this category. Yet it still outsells and ICE car which says something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never understood why the Mach-E is called Mustang. They are totally different cars for different use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42667902</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Kirin showcased its innovative electric salt spoon at CES 2025, designed to enhance the culinary experience by delivering precise amounts of salt with the push of a button. The gadget aims to address the common issue of over-salting food while offering a modern, tech-savvy approach to seasoning. The spoon's functionality combines convenience with a sleek design, appealing to both home cooks and professional chefs seeking to elevate their cooking techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

Is salt really that bad? How long would they live if they followed WHO's recommendations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But does it work?This is the third report I’ve seen in recent days and none of them mention if the spoon delivers on its promise. Reporters may be reluctant to share a spoon with dozens of other attendees, but might they practice some journalism by surveying folks who did try it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This idea has been around for a long time:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Wikipedia search patterns can reflect different styles of curiosity among users. It highlights a study that analyzed search data to categorize individuals' interests as either broad or niche. The findings suggest that users with broad curiosity tend to explore a wide range of topics, while those with a niche focus delve deeply into specific subjects. This divergence in search behavior offers insights into how people seek knowledge and engage with information, revealing varying motivations and approaches to learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In countries with higher education levels and greater gender equality, people browsed more like busybodies. In countries with lower scores on these variables, people browsed like hunters. Bassett hypothesizes that “in countries that have more structures of oppression or patriarchal forces, there may be a constraining of knowledge production that pushes people more toward this hyperfocus.”This is an odd hypothesis and you know, I’ve read a little bit of enough about postmodernism/critical theory and its influence on hypertext to feel like this take is down right saditty.The need to try to sow conflict between “patriarchy” and “xetriarchy” by depicting one style of curiosity as more virtuous than the other dampens what looks like an otherwise interesting study.And it doesn’t help that the authors don’t appear to list or accessibly depict which countries were more inclined toward one style as opposed to the other.https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn3268If anyone can decipher the sophistry in the actual study, please let me know what’s going on here, especially in figure 8.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related: Isaiah Berlin's "The Hedgehog and the Fox".

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to choose Common Lisp as their programming language of choice. The author outlines several compelling reasons, including the flexibility and power of Lisp's macro system, its ability to support multiple programming paradigms, and its suitability for complex problem-solving tasks and artificial intelligence. They also highlight the importance of Lisp's interactive development environment, which enhances productivity. Overall, the author advocates for Common Lisp as a valuable tool for developers seeking an expressive and efficient way to write programs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SBCL is a great choice! It's a surprisingly dynamic system (so are other CL implementations).A while ago, I did some private work for someone, using SBCL, and sent her the native binary I built, then forgot about the whole thing.The client came back with some new requirements much later, when the project was concluded, and the source code was already lost by that time.I vaguely remembered how I did things, so I spawned a REPL from the old binary, went into the relevant CL package, wrote a new function that overrides the old behavior, and the client's problem was solved.I did all those without the original source code. It was a small thing to fix, but I can't imagine making the same fix so swiftly with any other tech stack, when the source code is lost. I was deeply impressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is a very interesting journey — mine was exactly opposite, after many years with Common Lisp, I moved to Clojure and wouldn't even think of going back. I find it intriguing that the author would want to move in the other direction, especially as concurrency was mentioned (one of the main reasons why I initially looked at Clojure).I wonder what it was about babashka that didn't work for the author. When I need a quick script with batteries included, I use babashka and it works great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like vim-slime is essential to how you work with CL + vim. I've only used vim for not even 2 years, and came across vim-slime 6 months ago when working in ruby and wanting to quickly 'send' code from editor (neovim) to rails console. 2 months ago I launched a startup and for hours every day had to swat/fix repercussions of bugs that weren't apparent pre-launch (as well as doing via the console things users needed but weren't able to do because the feature to do it hadn't been built yet). It was daunting. I don't know how I'd have managed without vim + vim-slime. Probably a lot of copy/pasting from vscode. Vim + vim-slime was at least a 2x productivity improvement, and &gt;2x increase in developer happiness.Another huge benefit of vim and vim-slime is it is immediately valuable when you use/learn any new language. So long as the language has a REPL/console/interpreter that can be opened from the terminal or terminal emulator in any form (e.g. CL, ruby, python, bash etc etc etc) then vim + vim-slime will be a brilliant ~IDE. (Possibly the only thing I haven't been able to do but wanted to is 'send' code from neovim to the javascript console in chrome, which would be pretty awesome!)A side note: I found doom-emacs very similar to vim, only needed ~10 or so new keyboard shortcuts to be productive in emacs. (I still much prefer vim, but I'm not so down on emacs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42671105</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a new exoplanet named "LTT 9779 b," which orbits a star located about 260 light-years from Earth. This exoplanet is notable for its unusual characteristics, including a very short orbital period of just 19 hours and a highly inflated size, suggesting it may have a gaseous atmosphere. The research, conducted using the European Southern Observatory's instruments, provides insights into the nature of such extreme exoplanets and contributes to the understanding of planet formation and evolution in different stellar environments. The findings are expected to prompt further studies and observations of similar exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm noticing that the reporting on this, including the ESO press release, is vague on exactly what this "industrial megaproject" happens to be.  Ordinarily, there is no hesitation to disclose this, unless it's a military matter.  Or a sacred cow.A sacred cow, indeed.  It's a green energy operation powered by both wind and solar to generate hydrogen, electricity and ammonia.  Here[1] is the AES Andes press release about this project, if you care to read the opposing spin on this matter:"AES Chile submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to Chilean permitting authorities for a proposed industrial-scale green hydrogen project called Inna. The project, which is in early-stage development, could include a variety of solutions, including green hydrogen for export or domestic consumption, aligned with Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy."[1] https://www.aesandes.com/en/press-release/aes-andes-submits-...Land use.  It's not just a fossil fuel shill talking point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I lived in the Welsh countryside, there were occasional nights where I could not see my hand in front of my face. The requirements were that it was new moon, and that there was slight fog. We also lived deep in a valley, which helped. I had great fun navigating my way to the local pub in complete darkness.The odd thing is that when I recount that experience, some people refuse to believe me. Of course they are all city dwellers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it be unthinkable to just NOT have bright lights pointed at the sky all night? Could they still do this project with severe restrictions on light emissions? If there’s some reason it absolutely must include hundreds of outdoor sodium vapor lights then build it somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42668953</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Cobol and its evolution into Cobvious, a modern programming language that retains the readability and business-oriented features of Cobol while incorporating modern programming concepts and practices. It highlights the potential of Cobvious to facilitate the use of legacy systems while enabling developers to write code that is easier to maintain and integrate with contemporary technologies. The purpose of the article is to explore the significance of reviving and adapting older programming languages to meet current software development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Header files are one of the things I miss the most about languages that aren't C. Having a very clear distinction between public and private, and interface and implementation is one of my favourite things about C code (at least the way I write it).Being able to just read through a library's .h files to know how to use it is really nice. Typically, my .h files don't really look like my .c files because all the documentation for how to use the thing lives in the .h file (and isn't duplicated in the .c file). It would be entirely possible to put this documentation into the .c file, but it makes reading the interface much less pleasant for someone using it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the author has WAY more knowledge/experience than me on this and so I wonder how he would solve the following issues:Evaluating Constant Expressions- This seems really complicated...if you're working within a translation unit, thats much simplified, but then you're much more limited in what you can do without repeating a lot of code. I wonder how the author solves this.Compile Time Unit Tests- This is already somewhat possible if you can express your test as a macro, which if you add in the first point, then this becomes trivial.Forward Referencing of Declarations- I think there may be a lot of backlash to this one. The main argument against this is that it then changes the compiler from a one-pass to two pass compiler which has its own performance implications. Given the number of people who are trying to compile massive codebases and go as far as parallelizing compilation of translation units, this may be a tough pill for them to swallow. (evaluating constant expressions probably comes with a similar/worse performance hit caveat depending on how its done)Importing Declarations- This is a breaking change...one of the ways I have kind of implemented templating in C is by defining a variable and importing a c file, changing the variable, and then reimporting the same c file. Another thing I've done is define a bunch of things and then import the SQLite C Amalgamation and then add another function (I do this to expose a SQLite internal which isnt exposed via its headers). All of these use cases would break with this change.Are there any thoughts about these issues? Any ways to solve them perhaps?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write unit tests for my C code all that time. It's not difficult if you use a good build system and if you are willing to stomach some boilerplate. Here is one test from    my "test suite" for my npy library:    void
    test_load_uint8() {
        npy_arr *arr = npy_load("tests/npy/uint8.npy");
        assert(arr-&gt;n_dims == 1);
        assert(arr-&gt;dims[0] == 100);
        assert(arr-&gt;type == 'u');
        npy_free(arr);
    }
    int
    main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        PRINT_RUN(test_load_uint8);
        ...
    }

I know I could have some pre-processor generate parts of the tests, but I prefer to KISS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669637</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the specified website provides an overview of Phi-4, a powerful language model developed by OLLAMA. It highlights its capabilities in natural language processing and generation, explaining how it can be applied in various contexts, including chatbots, content creation, and data analysis. The piece emphasizes the model’s design for efficiency, scalability, and adaptability, making it suitable for both developers and businesses looking to enhance their AI-driven applications. Additionally, it offers insights into the model's training, features, and access options.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the holidays, we published a post[1] on using high-precision few-shot examples to get `gpt-4o-mini` to perform similar to `gpt-4o`. I just re-ran that same experiment, but swapped out `gpt-4o-mini` with `phi-4`.`phi-4` really blew me away in terms of learning from few-shots. It measured as being 97% consistent with `gpt-4o` when using high-precision few-shots! Without the few-shots, it was only 37%. That's a huge improvement!By contrast, with few-shots it performs as well as `gpt-4o-mini` (though `gpt-4o-mini`'s baseline without few-shots was 59% – quite a bit higher than `phi-4`'s).[1] https://bits.logic.inc/p/getting-gpt-4o-mini-to-perform-like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone blown away by how fast we got to running something this powerful locally? I know it's easy to get burnt out on llms but this is pretty incredible.I genuinely think we're only 2 years away from full custom local voice to voice llm assistants that grow with you like JOI in BR2049 and it's going to change how we think about being human and being social, and how we grow up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s odd that MS is releasing models they are competitors to OA. This reinforce the idea that there is no real strategic advantage in owning a model. I think the strategy is now offer cheap and performant infra to run the models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42642971</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of decentralized syndication as a potential solution to improve how content is shared across the internet. It highlights the limitations of current centralized platforms, which control content distribution and user engagement, leading to issues such as censorship and lack of control over personal data. The author advocates for a new protocol that fosters decentralized communication and collaboration, enabling users to retain ownership of their content and data while encouraging a more open and resilient internet ecosystem. The piece emphasizes the importance of developing such protocols for a fairer digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would love to have an RSS interface where I can republish articles to a number of my own feeds (selectively or automatically). Then I can follow some my friends' republished feeds.I feel like the "one feed" approach of most social platform is not here to benefit users but to encourage doom-scrolling with FOMO. It would be a lot harder for them to get so much of users' time and tolerance for ads if it were actually organized. But it seems to me that there might not be that much work needed to turn an RSS reader into a very productive social platform for sharing news and articles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While everyone is waiting for Atproto to proto, ActivityPub is already here. This is giving me "Sumerians look on in confusion as god creates world" vibes.https://theonion.com/sumerians-look-on-in-confusion-as-god-c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its not obvious to me that what is missing here is another technical protocol rather than more effective 'social protocols'. If you havent noticed, the major issues of today is not the scaling of message passing per-se but the moderation of content and violations of the boundary between public and private. These issues are socially defined and cannot be delegated to (possibly algorithmic) protocols.In other words what is missing is rules, regulations and incentives that are adapted to the way people use the digital domain and enforce the decentralized exchange of digital information to stay within a consensus "desired" envelope.Providing capabilities in code and network design is ofcourse a great enabler, but drifting into technosolutionism of the bitcoin type is a dead end. Society is not a static user of technical protocols. If left without  matching social protocols any technical protocol will be exploited and fail.The example of abusive hyperscale social media should be a warning: they emerged as a behavior, they were not specified anywhere in the underlying web design. Facebook is just one website after all. Tim Berners-Lee probably did not anticipate that one endpoint would succesfully fake being the entire universe.The deeper question is, do we want the shape of digital networks to reflect the observed concentration or  real current social and economic networks or do we want to use the leverage of this new techology to shape things in a different (hopefully better) direction?The mess we are in today is not so much failure of technology as it is digital illiteracy, from the casual user all the way to the most influential legal and political roles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42654891</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing trend of governments demanding backdoors in encryption technologies, which compromises data security for users. It highlights the potential risks and dangers of implementing such backdoors, including the vulnerability to cyberattacks and exploitation by malicious actors. The piece also examines various case studies and examples where government pressures have led to weakened security measures, stressing the importance of maintaining strong encryption to protect privacy and security in a digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially funny to see four parasites on one government domain. Do skiddies not excise other skiddies' backdoors when pwning systems so they can have them all to themselves?&gt; We then hooked that up to the AWS Route53 API, and just bought them en-masse. Honestly, it’s $20, and we’ve done worse with more.&gt; We’re incredibly grateful for the support of The Shadowserver Foundation, who have agreed yet again to save us from our own adventures and to take ownership of the domains implicated in this research and sinkhole them.I wish we could collectively stop using the terms “buy” and “own” with regard to domains. Try “leased” or “rented”. If they could be bought then they wouldn't have been available again for this exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved this write up. Light-hearted. Conscious of the impact of any disclosure. Everything substantiated, but not taking themselves too seriously. Enjoying read, and at the same time talking about a serious issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what would happen if they exploited these webshells' backdoors to delete the webshells...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674455</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's perspective on scheduling calls, emphasizing the importance of setting boundaries around time management. The author prefers to communicate through written formats, such as email or messaging, to foster clearer, more organized interactions. They advocate for acknowledging the potential inefficiencies of phone calls and suggest alternatives that can lead to more productive exchanges. The key message is to prioritize efficiency and respect for one's own time, encouraging others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone needs to write the other side of the story as a small startup owner having to deal with big businesses. It should feature:- Beeing asked for demos when they could have tried your free tier/trial and you have decent doc (They always prefer that you waste your time then asking someone on thier side to review)- Being used a price/feature comparison with your enterprise competitor just so they can get a better deal on their renewal (no stupid they never intended to change)- Having to fill endless security questionnaire without being sure you can even sell to them (what you dont love filling 100+ questions at 11PM on a Friday???).- Having to deal 3-6 months with procurement, often with one or two third party software resellers which only cares if he can make its margin (hello there CDW, no I wont lower my price 15% so you can make money)- Receiving the money 60-90 days after the deal close while you struggle with cashflow and you had to provide the service (and receiving a call from my bank rep to see why my margin and CC is full).I am sure I can think of more things. That is why I will absolutely charge an arm and leg to big businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against all of the advice in the world, I'm trying to set things up to avoid basically everything described in the article. It's tricky because the truth is that a lot of the tactics work and that is why companies implement them. A lot of investors also consider that process to be best-in-class and look for it as a sign of maturity.The counter approach is:
- Make complete information available as transparently as possible and don't gate it.
- Be forthcoming about weaknesses. Don't force prospects and customers to find them.
- Ensure that when a prospect or customer does want to talk to someone, they immediately reach someone who can handle the problem or answer the question (no need for escalations.)
- Never have an AI agent call someone unless the customer specifically requests that and be sure that all AI agents immediately disclose that they are AI.
- Offer flexible e-mail list subscription options (monthly, quarterly, annually, only release notes, etc.)
- If the product is not a fit, try to offer something useful anyway such as a suggestion of another product that might be a better match for their needs.Value based pricing is one of the reasons why a lot of companies end up in these situations. Rather than setting a standard price, the company does a detailed investigation of the customer to try to find out how much value they will gain from using the product and then they set the price based on that determination. Although it maximizes revenue in theory, it is slow and invasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate and nicely written article.There's a worse angle I've seen on the same story: A different engineer, who was already running the good open source solution successfully with their team, heard the other engineer had an enterprise sales assault dumped on them, for some load of trash, and so tried to sound the alarm, but it was already out of the other engineer's hands, because upper subtrees of the org chart had already signed on with political capital (and in a couple cases, it's somehow become an express personal performance metric that they spend the company's money on this specific product).  So all alternatives are blocked, everyone has to wait the next couple months for the sale to finalize, and then another month for IT to set up the SSO and databases, and forced to migrate from working solutions to garbage.  Then eventually the contract doesn't get renewed, with appropriate face-saving for those who pushed it through, but half the people upon whom it was inflicted have already found jobs in better companies, a quarter got PIP'd or stalled careers for being sabotaged by the trash, and the remaining quarter will mostly be laid off next year.Just say NO to enterprise sales.The only thing worse than having to do enterprise sales to sell your own product, is being the employees forced to use the likely bad purchasing decisions of other enterprise sales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669754</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like uv, and it's the first package manager for a while where I haven't felt like it's a minor improvement on what I'm using but ultimately something better will come out a year or two later. I'd love if we standardized on it as a community as the de facto default, especially for new folks coming in. I personally now recommend it to nearly everyone, instead of the "welllll I use poetry but pyenv works or you could use conda too"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I usually stay away far FAR from shiny new tools but I've been experimenting with uv and I really like it. I'm a bit bummed that it's not written in Python but other than that, it does what it says on the tin.I never liked pyenv because I really don't see the point/benefit building every new version of Python you want to use. There's a reason I don't run Gentoo or Arch anymore. I'm very happy that uv grabs pre-compiled binaries and just uses those.So far I have used it to replace poetry (which is great btw) in one of my projects. It was pretty straightforward, but the project was also fairly trivial/typical.I can't fully replace pipx with it because 'uv tool' currently assumes every Python package only has one executable. Lots of things I work with have multiple, such as Ansible and Jupyterlab. There's a bug open about it and the workarounds are not terrible, but it'd be nice if they are able to fix that soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heck, you can get even cleaner than that by using uv’s support for PEP 723’s inline script dependencies:  # /// script
  # requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "pandas",
  # ]
  # ///

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses why the Mac Mini G4 is considered the best classic Macintosh for retro gaming enthusiasts. It highlights the device's compact design, versatility, and performance capabilities that make it suitable for playing older games.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great comprehensive article on the "why" and there are good YouTube videos on the "how." What the article is missing that makes it even better is putting an SSD in which makes it even faster of course. You can get an untested Mac mini G4 for about $60 on eBay and the rest of the parts (SSD, PATA-mSATA adapter, RAM if less than 1 GB, power adapter, any missing screws, clock battery, etc.) will run you another $60 to make the ultimate Mac OS 9 machine. If you're comfortable taking things apart and putting them back together it's not too bad.A quick tip: be sure to reset the PRAM with command-alt-p-r holding down during restart until you hear 3 chimes. Then while the machine is booting hold down command-alt-o-f and type "reset-nvram" and then "set-defaults" and then "reset-all" (all of this is in open firmware) before installing Mac OS 9 to make sure firmware is in its original state.I came across this idea of SSD upgrading and installing Mac OS 9 in April 2024 and bought three broken ones to build one for my son. [0] When the first one worked, I ended up figuring, why not just finish the other two and sell them on eBay?That led me into a hobby business. I've now cleaned, upgraded with SSDs, and sold about 70 of them. The "business" basically breaks even, so it truly is a hobby. In fact I invested so much in inventory buying 90 of them in a lot at the end of 2024 that I am negative right now. I will probably turn a slight profit in 2025. But it's fun and if you want you can buy one from me at:
https://os9.shopSorry for the self-promotion, but very relevant!0: https://x.com/davekopec/status/1795872492386398683&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The depth of this article is wonderful. The PowerPC line did have lots of good things going for it, and the Mac mini G4 is a good example of how much you can get done with modest space, power and heat.I'm still using Mac mini G4s in several places, both for Mac OS X (legacy Final Chop) and as small, low power servers running NetBSD.There are really only two drawbacks to the Mac mini G4, in my opinion:Gigabit ethernet would've been a dollar or two more? Being stuck with 100 Mbps, or around 300 Mbps if one uses a gigabit USB adapter, isn't fun.If the DIMM slot could take 2 gig DIMMs, this'd be a perfect machine. Other PowerPC Macs could take 2 gigs - heck, even the older PowerPC 604e Power Macs 9500 and 9600 could take 1.5 gigs - so being limited to 1 gig is a bit unfortunate, especially considering that 2 gig DDR DIMMs are a thing (later Xserve G5 units could take 2 gig DDR DIMMs).Still, the Mac mini G4 is the only computer aside from SBCs that I've bought brand new, and I have always been very happy with my decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a 2002 TiBook[1]; it officially supports MacOS 9.2.2, but also every OS X release up to 10.5.8. I've been surprised to find that the retail copy of StarCraft that I bought in 2009 not only includes an OS X build, but also supports PowerPC![1]: https://www.rollc.at/posts/2024-07-02-tibook/I'm not sure if it can be made to run m68k apps "natively", but on the other hand you can emulate just about any classic MacOS in a modern browser[2].[2]: https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674385</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the state of internet protocol address allocation as of January 2025, focusing on the current trends in address distribution and management by various regional internet registries (RIRs). It highlights the challenges posed by IPv4 address exhaustion and the transition to IPv6. The piece emphasizes the importance of efficient address allocation for internet service providers (ISPs) and the ongoing efforts to facilitate the broader adoption of IPv6 to ensure sufficient address availability for future internet growth. Additionally, it provides statistics and analysis on address usage, availability, and the impacts of policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this blog does not accurately describe how large the ipv6 address space even after accounting for it being reduced by 2^64 for the host portion of the address. If it did it would make the concerned comments about /28 ipv6 network sizes seem very misplaced.A single static ipv4 address is a /32 slice into the ipv4 space and is considered a reasonable to size give out to a single person or even a small business that asks for it. Of course larger companies and telecom operators need larger network allocations and they have gotten them for many years in the past.Now realize that if a /64 ipv6 network is the minimum size like a single ipv4 address then you see that the ipv6 address space has 2^32  /32 ipv6 networks. Now with ipv6 any technical person and acquire a entire ipv4 internet sized network in a continuous (globally routeable if you want) range.And if any sized business today can expect buy a single "class c" /24 range of ipv4 it makes sense that large global compaines get a ipv6 /20 network to run their entire network on it.For example cloudflare[1] uses 6 regional /32 networks and a /29 network for all their routing needs. Imaging trying to build cloudflare with less than 32 addresses in a single /24 ipv4 allocation.ipv6 is so large that you can just design your network without worrying about subnet size and route based on real policy or security boundaries alone. We will run out of MAC addresses before we run out of ipv6[1] https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeing the domain which screams Australian (potaroo, quoll, quokka, et al) I looked at the author's name which brought back a few memories :-)For general interest, this is (among other accolades) 2012 Internet Hall of Fame Inductee Geoff Huston https://www.internethalloffame.org/official-biography-geoff-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting how the IPv4 price has pulled back 30% since early 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670468</guid></item><item><title>13.

And, I hope you, like I once did, find a problem that you can fall in love with for a few years.To those just finished: Congratulations! Don’t forget to keep pushing!To those many years out: You have to keep pushing too, but there can be tremendous value in starting all over again by pushing in a different direction. You have no idea what you may find between the tips of two fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, I can attest that nowadays, in some fields, research has become a 'game', where:- people torture data until it yields unreproducible results;- people choose venues that maximise their chances of getting published (and pay for publication sometimes, I'm looking at you, APC);- little concern given to excellence, rigour, and impact;- the chase for a 'diploma' from a renowned institute without putting the effort;I could go on and on, but I'll stop now.Perhaps something changes, I am waiting for this to happen for some time now (10y and counting).It's a bad system but that's what we have (at the moment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm starting a PhD — essentially from tomorrow. It's a shame to see so much discouragement here, but at this point I'm no longer surprised. I also don't care because if left to my own devices I would do research anyway.In the kindest possible way: screw all of you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42671512</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;In her article, Rachel discusses the concept of "lag" in the context of programming languages and development processes, emphasizing how the perception of time can differ based on various factors, such as project complexity and one's level of experience. She reflects on her own experiences with lag when learning new technologies and tools, highlighting the importance of patience and continuous learning in overcoming these challenges. By sharing her insights, she aims to encourage others to embrace the learning curve and recognize that progress can take time, often leading to deeper understanding and mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure I get the fifty years bit at the very end. Anyone care to explain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice descriptive article. I've done this on purpose too to debug
remote filesystem syncs and cryptography problems where machines are
out of sync. My GPS wall clock is handy for adjusting NTP, but the
time it takes to scan my eyes from the wall back to the monitor.. you
really do need two stacked like she did. So I now figured to use
transparrent terminals each logged into a different host and lay them
over one another running "watch -n1 date".Would have been nice to have some more network, code and command line
examples.  You need to set up a local ntpd and need to point your
local master at that temporarily. A better utility to write would be
"timediff -s1 -s2" that takes two time servers and shows the offset. I
bet there's a way to do that in one line. Anyone?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a standard "smearing" period now? For a while, Google had a 24 hour adjustment period, 12 hours on each side of the leap second, while Facebook used a shorter period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650732</guid></item><item><title>15.

I went through several rounds and was basically ghosted after the 4th with no explanation or follow up. The last interview was to write an blog post for their blog which I submitted and then didn’t hear back until continuously nagging months later. It was pretty disheartening since all of the interviews were some form of a take-home and I spent a combined total of ~10 hours or more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo on the homepage for the completion of the findMaxElement function is a good example of what is to come. Or maybe where we are at now?The six lines of Python suggested for that function can also be replaced with a simple “return max(arr)”. The suggested code works but is absolute junior level.I am terrified of what is to come. Not just horrible code but also how people who blindly “autocomplete” this code are going to stall in their skill level progress.You may score some story points but did you actually get any better at your craft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never imagined our project would make it to the HN front page on Sunday!Tabby has undergone significant development since its launch two years ago [0]. It is now a comprehensive AI developer platform featuring code completion and a codebase chat, with a team [1] / enterprise focus (SSO, Access Control, User Authentication).Tabby's adopters [2][3] have discovered that Tabby is the only platform providing a fully self-service onboarding experience as an on-prem offering. It also delivers performance that rivals other options in the market.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a project called "Tiny Tapeout," which aims to make hardware design and fabrication more accessible to hobbyists. It specifically focuses on a small donut-shaped chip designed for educational purposes, highlighting the process of creating the design, the technical details involved, and the outcome of the project. The author emphasizes the potential of such initiatives to inspire more people to engage in electronics and chip design, ultimately promoting DIY hardware development and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going slightly off topic, I was interested to learn from this blog about Tiny Tapeout, the service they've used to order their custom chip design. The concept for anyone as unfamiliar with it as me is that lots of people pay a few hundred dollars each to get a small part of a chip being made, and once it's made they receive the chip ready to use with their section everyone else's, too, with a way to choose which bit gets run.I know basically nothing about chip design, and I'm wondering if anyone could tell me: is this only useful for education purposes, for example learning how to make a chip that creates a donut on a screen, or are there people using Tiny Tapeout for useful projects, too?For each of their chip runs, they publish a list of the different people's projects that got included - https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ - but it's not easy to spot which ones might be more than somebody just learning how to play with chip design.Essentially, if someone were to pick this up as a hobby, what is the most interesting thing they could make using this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yay, a1k0n!Long time since AI Challenge, I see you're dabbling into hardware too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So great to see this excellent explanation.  Have been a fan of donut.c since it first came out.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical significance of a simple animal guessing game created in the 1980s, which served as a precursor to modern machine learning. It highlights how this game utilized an early form of artificial intelligence by allowing players to guess animals based on their characteristics, while the system learned from mistakes and improved over time. This innovation laid the groundwork for later advances in AI, illustrating how foundational ideas in machine learning existed before the technology gained widespread popularity. The piece reflects on the evolution of AI and its roots in playful experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In two places the article states that the original game had the ability to save the updated tree ("it had the ability to save progress and load it during the next run" and "It is an amazing example... of how, even with such a simple language, ... and the ability to save new questions").The later part says the opposite - that the original implementation had "No ability to save progress" and that this is new in the C++ implementation.I can't help but wonder (also due to other language features) if the author ran the article through an AI to 'tidy up' before posting... because I've often found ChatGPT etc. to introduce changes in meaning like this, rather than just rewriting. This is not to dismiss either the article or the power of LLM's, just a curious observation :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like "Pervading Animal" (or just "Animal") from the 1970's [1].

&lt;p&gt;The article "Life in Console" by Eugene Andrienko explores the concept of using command-line interfaces (CLI) as a powerful tool for productivity and efficiency in computing. Andrienko discusses the advantages of working with consoles, including faster navigation and control over system processes compared to graphical user interfaces (GUI). He emphasizes the learning curve associated with mastering CLI tools but argues that the investment in learning can lead to significant improvements in workflow and problem-solving. The piece serves as both an introduction and a motivational piece for those looking to enhance their skills in using command-line resources.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I have been using Linux since 1996 or so, and do have quite an opinionated workflow, I never could agree with this kind of ultraconservative approach to things. History never stops. Things change. Linux changes. Not every day, not every month, but every couple of years something has to go. And that's ok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have found openbsd to be one of the best unix desktop systems. Which is strange as that is not something they advertise as being good at. A large part of this is familiarity with the system(surprise, if you use a system a lot, you get comfortable with it) but some of it is this subtle feeling that the developers actually use it as a daily driver, which is often not the case with many linux systems.Now there are some huge caveats to this statement, When I say unix desktop I mean fairly bare bones terminal heavy classic unix type operating environment, If you want something more like a mac or windows desktop, but don't want to use mac or windows, than a linux distro offering that is probably more suitable. But openbsd does.. ok... here as well.Most problems with the heavy wimp style desktop environments are system administration related, where they don't understand openbsd system administration. personally I prefer cli based administration tools, and get a bit agitated when I have to worry about conflicting with some unknown desktop manager app that also wants to admin the system. So this works out great for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thats a long time to spend in it. Likely stuck trying to quit vim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674153</guid></item><item><title>19.

That means that tactical decisions are made by the people who are doing the work, not managersI've worked at various places where this was supposedly the system.Guess who had budgets, hiring powers, went to leadership offsites? Yeah not the ICs. It usually just means the C level will smile and nod while "listening" to your feedback instead of ignoring you completelyHas anyone worked at a true inverted company where centuries of classical power structures are thrown out the window?I feel it can never be properly implemented unless in eg a cooperative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, but not surprising, that Agility only made place 5, way behind Quality. It will soon be a quarter of a century since the Agile Manifesto has been published.  It would be sad if we hadn't progressed since then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that they have a programming philosophy that they want people at the company to adopt. A common problem I see at companies that don't have onboarding is that people join the team with assumptions from previous jobs but you never level set them with the company. So 12 months down the line the new guy wants to change the process and you have to repeat the same discussions about what agile means for the nth time.Amazon does a good job of training new hire on the 'Amazon way'. Amazon does 6 pagers, they do design docs. Amazon does SOA. Amazon does not use relational databases. Everything has an API. Because of the 'Amazon way' and the training they do new team members understand at least some of the context and expectations.Is it the best way? Probably not but no one knows what the best way is anyway. At least they have a way. Saves a lot of effort compared to every new hire relitigating the process and architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676123</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Rewilding the Self" explores the concept of rewilding as a means to reconnect individuals with their natural instincts and surroundings. It discusses how modern society often suppresses innate human behaviors and encourages disconnection from nature. The author advocates for practices that promote self-discovery and a deeper relationship with the environment, emphasizing the importance of mindfulness, community, and authentic experiences in fostering a more balanced and fulfilling life. Through rewilding, individuals can reclaim their true selves and enhance their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are nature. The separation between humanity and nature is a false one, that works against conservation efforts.I like the idea of rewilding because it forces us to see ourselves as part of a large natural system - which is what we are - and helps grow appreciation for that system.But until there is a way for recognition of that system to become more profitable than "othering" nature - polluting the environment, destroying parts of that system - or regulation prevents that othering, it can be depressingly isolating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My problem with the term “ecological balance” is that it doesn’t exist. It’s a mythical term that seems invented by Disney. Nature is brutal. Populations will get wiped out, species will disappear.That’s exactly why having a lot of species is important. But it’s hardly balanced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the world's population now exceeding 8 billion, we need to be thoughtful about the best way to rewild ourselves. We can live in dense cities with concrete high-rises but animals can't. Many animals at the top of the food chain need significant ranges for themselves. So the challenge is finding a way that we can minimize our footprint while also providing more opportunities for legitimate connection with nature. Put another way, a bimodal life - with time split between a concrete high-rises and natural areas is probably more ideal for the overall system than a push for everyone to live in slightly more rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672758</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have two Chrome extensions in the store. They're not very popular and are really just features I wanted for my own use. I think I have less than 100 users total.At least once a week I get emails from people- offering money to add their "tracking" code- wanting to purchased the extension outrightWhat they clearly want is access to my modest install base to push questionable code onto. I certainly am not going for these offers, but I could certainly see someone less financially secure giving in to it, and that scares me a little.The idea of paid malware insertion in smaller packages is kind of troubling in general. How often just in life in general do we just trust opaque binaries to be clean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These rogue extensions are "surreptitiously monetizing web searches" - but doesn't Google conspicuously monetize web searches?So it seems the Google TOS bans competition in search monetization using their "open source" browser. Isn't it odd that an "open source" browser is apparently designed to provide a monopoly on search monetization by the nice people who give it to you for free?And being 80% or so of all searches:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-...It seems like Peter Thiel's claim that google is a search advertising monopoly masquerading as a (competitive, non-monopoly) technology company might be spot on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google would prefer to focus on limiting ad blockers with V3 instead of protecting users from these extensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640207</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This advice to quit social media is always a hit on HN. When I was 10 years younger I read the same thing on HN, was thoroughly convinced and quit social media. I even followed the advice of trying to stay in touch by email. Sure.Turns out that a lot of people I knew posted huge life updates that I completely missed out on. I asked them why they didn’t tell me and they were confused. They said the posted it on social media. I can’t speak for everyone, but I know a lack of social media meant that I have lost touch with old acquaintances completely. I have a few close friends and that’s it.Maybe that’s an ok tradeoff to make, but it’s worth knowing that before getting into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When something is used by billions of people its kinda futile to argue about its utility. But then billions are addicted to tobacco, alcohol, drugs, gambling etc. and those benefitting from providing these "services" will do everything they can to keep people addicted while arguing that they are solving a real problem.The reality is always a mundane core that gets complicated by human tragicomedy. Ofcourse its wholesome to be able to connect digitally with friends and family. Its also a great economic enabler to connect digitally with professionals. Or to be able to publish to a bulleting board about your brilliant accomplishments.But to paraphrase Gates, we need these connections, we don't need the self-appointed universal connectors.Its 2025, and this is HN. I put it to you that technically the only thing preventing us today from having good "connections infrastructure" is the corrupting influence of big adtech. One possible vision of how to organize the digital space in technical and economic terms had become the only vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to be a producer more than a consumer. I produce videos (admittedly that are technical and dry) so it's not like I get hundreds of thousands of views.On my downtime I still participate in social media though usually anonymously in the form of shit posting. Or just watching YouTube. I did get sucked into that crap of posting everyday about my glamorous life. Eventually I found I didn't know what to post anymore. Had to find something to post. I'm glad I never got sucked into it completely like TikTok/Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677587</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the process of using Next.js and related tools for testing applications, focusing on a step-by-step approach to ensure high-quality software development. It emphasizes creating a systematic testing environment, utilizing various testing frameworks, and integrating them into the development workflow. The author provides practical tips on configuring tests for specific scenarios, improving overall application performance, and maintaining consistent testing practices throughout the development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer per process over the alternatives.When you write code you have the choice to do per process, per thread, or sequential.The problem is that doing multiple tests in a shared space doesn't necessarily match the world in which this code is run.Per process testing allows you to design a test that matches the usage of your codebase. Per thread already constrains you.For example: we might elect to write a job as a process that runs on demand, and the library we use has a memory leak, but it can't be fixed in reasonable time. Since we write it as a process that gets restarted we manage to constrain the behavior.Doing multiple tests in multiple threads might not work here as there is a shared space that is retained and isn't representative of real world usage.Concurrency is a feature of your software that you need to code for. So if you have multiple things happening, then that should be part of your test harness.The test harness forcing you to think of it isn't always a desirable trait.That said, I have worked on a codebase where we discovered bugs because the tests were run in parallel, in a shared space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A much better model still is a mixture.* Use multiple processes, but multiple tests per process as well.* Randomly split and order the tests on every run, to encourage catching flakiness. Print the seed for this as part of the test results for reproducibility.* Tag your tests a lot (this is one place where, as many languages provide, "test classes" or other grouping is very useful). Smoke tests should run before all other tests, and all run in one process (though still in random order). Known long-running tests should be tagged to use a dedicated process and mostly start early (longest first), except that a few cores should be reserved to work through the fast tests so they can fail early.* If you need to kill a timed-out test even though other tests are still running in the same process - just kill the process anyway, and automatically run the other tests again.* Have the harness provide fixtures like "this is a temporary directory, you don't have to worry about clearing it on failure", so tests don't have to worry about cleaning up if killed. Actually, why not just randomly kill a few tests regardless?I wrote some more about tests here [1], but I'm not sure I'll update it any more because of Github's shitty 2FA-but-only-the-inconvenience-not-the-security requirement.[1]: https://gist.github.com/o11c/ef8f0886d5967dfebc3d&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nextest is one of the very small handful of tools I use dozens or hundreds of times a day. Parallelism can reduce test suite execution time significantly, depending on your project, and has saved me cumulative days of my life. The output is nicer, test filtering is nicer, leak detection is great, and the developer is friendly and responsive. Thanks sunshowers!The one thing we've had to be aware of is that the execution model means there can sometimes be differences in behaviour between nextest and cargo test. Very occasionally there are tests that fail in cargo test but succeed in nextest due to better isolation. In practice this just means that we run cargo test in CI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649139</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that the "cargo cult" metaphor, commonly used to describe the adoption of superficial practices without understanding their underlying principles, is becoming outdated and counterproductive. It discusses how this metaphor often leads to dismissing innovative ideas and practices instead of fostering a deeper understanding of their significance. The author emphasizes the need for a more constructive approach in discussions about technology and methodologies, advocating for embracing new concepts rather than clinging to outdated metaphors that hinder constructive dialogue and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nah, we better abandon this kind of retroactive policing of language instead from people with nothing better to do.Nobody who uses the term "cargo cult" in a technical settings does it out of spite or even refers to specific nations or peoples. Just refers to the core takeaway of a practice which might as we be all lore.Care about politics and colonialism and injustice and what have you? There are 1000000 causes you could devote your time and make an active  difference to people actually suffering this very moment, rather than language policing tech terms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I this post has enabled me to put my finger on what makes me uncomfortable about  articles like this.Even though I frequently understand and sympathise with the goals and feelings of the writers, there are two factors that stand out.1.  A sense of certainty of the causal nature of the issues at hand.  It comes across that the author has concluded the correct course of action.2.  Everybody, including you,  should follow their concluded course of action.I would be fine with an article talking about what the cargo cult metaphor means, its historical accuracy and how the author thinks that impacts upon people.   It would then seem to be quite reasonable for them to say that they are going to cease using the metaphor because of those reasons, and to invite people to consider doing the same if they think the reasons seem valid to them.It's ok to say"I think this, so I'm going to change my behaviour"It seems unreasonable to say."I think this, so everyone should change their behaviour"Unfortunately it feels like we are heading to"I know this, so everyone should change their behaviour"The call for everyone else to change is backed by the certainty of their opinion.  It presents complainants as wanting you to do their thing not because it's their opinion,  it's because it is undeniable fact.  It places you as morally deficient if you disagree.This affects things large and small,  whether people want you to boycott a brand of toothpaste, or talk about milliBTC as the base unit of bitcoin,  or talk about the topic they are uninterested in in a different forum.    The solution is simple, everyone has to do this simple act of my bidding.Surely if the case for the damage caused by the cargo cult metaphor were to be made clearly and undeniable,  people would not need to be told to stop using it,  They just would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nope, we’re not doing this in 2025. Cargo cult succinctly expresses an important concept. We’re not catering to imaginary offenses somebody hallucinates on behalf of some supposedly marginalized people anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675025</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the Chatham House Rule, which is designed to encourage open dialogue by allowing participants to speak freely without attribution. It highlights how this principle is often applied in discussions but can inadvertently contribute to a sense of burnout among attendees who feel pressured to engage without the chance to express themselves fully. The piece emphasizes the importance of balancing open communication with the well-being of participants, suggesting that organizers should find ways to alleviate pressure and foster meaningful interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not new. Many of the mailing lists that dominated the discourse of the early Internet in the 1990s operated under a similar rule. The novelty is that it disappeared almost entirely for decades.The original purpose (on the Internet) was to create a space where complex ethical and moral questions could be explored and discussed in depth without risk of someone taking a hypothetical statement out of context to slander you, as people are wont to do. It would be orders of magnitude worse in this current age of people obsessed with generating click-bait for engagement, which wasn’t a thing back then. I personally found that environment to be intellectually stimulating and rigorous, I miss the standard of discourse of those days.Chatham House Rule is going back to the old Internet, which valued novel insight and reasoned discourse highly, before the masses took over the Internet. The purpose was not to enable edgelords. Rational defense of ideas, statements, and hypotheses was expected and table stakes. Related rules of that era, such as Crocker’s Rule[0], placed responsibility on the reader to address uncomfortable or offensive feedback in the most dispassionate way possible.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12881288&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Denunciations of the Chatham House Rule seem underdeveloped. According to the history on Wikipedia, it was invented to let members of post-WW1 English civic society discuss and debate potential reforms, and then get as much of that discussion into the public record as desired without having individual members pilloried for things they said during the discussion, even if the rest of the group disagreed with them.This doesn’t even seem unique. Newspaper editorial boards don’t assign individual names to editorials or sentences thereof. Individual members of Congressional commissions aren’t cited for the sentences they (or their staff) committed to reports.Chatham House Rule, meet Chesterton’s Fence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems pretty obvious why in a world where if you misspeak or say something ill considered it can be all over twitter and have serious personal and professional ramifications.Regardless of how well meaning people are in their desire to hold people to account for bad views, it does have a chilling effect, and you can't learn if you don't have a safe place to make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669027</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the probabilities associated with token generation in large language models (LLMs). It explores how LLMs predict the next token based on context, detailing the statistical methods involved and the implications of token selection on model performance. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these probabilities for optimizing LLM applications and improving their effectiveness in various tasks. Additionally, the article potentially covers practical examples and mathematical frameworks that illustrate these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

In the CoT summary it acknowledges that the most recent official information is 1611m, but it then chooses to say 1622 because it's more commonly cited. It's like it over-thinks itself into the wrong answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bank account anchoring bias may be just the base model predicting as best as it can, as OP described earlier. Imagine a random Internet page where you read "There is V in my X. The Y of Z A, in Bs, is _." What do you expect? V, of course! Because why would a person on the Internet ever join these two factoids if they were totally unrelated (as they are in fact in this example)?

&lt;p&gt;Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that utilizes virtualization to compartmentalize different tasks into isolated environments called qubes. This design enhances security by preventing malware or other threats from affecting the entire system. Qubes OS allows users to run various operating systems simultaneously and supports secure application management, making it particularly suitable for users with high security needs, such as developers or cybersecurity professionals. The website provides resources, documentation, and community support for both new and experienced users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have used it for several months as my daily OS and dropped it because of bad graphics performance (only software rendering supported, many frame drops when watching HD videos on YT) and bad battery management. Due to software rendering the overall systems perfmance also dropped. So I cannot recommend it for people with high requirements on graphics and battery duration. Besides that it was an interesting and good experience.I think it would be good to make it possible to deactivate certain security features such as strict graphics isolation so that users can adjust their settings to their risk acceptance level. It would also be interesting to be able to optionally replace Xen with lighter isolation mechanisms, even if the user would compromise on security here too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We wouldn't have to rely on security by hypervisor if linux had proper security measures, sandboxing and access controls OOTB. Qubes is still far from good although it's slowly getting there&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though I never used Qubes OS I used to really enjoy Joanna Rutkowska's passion for it.Other women who's computing enthusiasm I enjoyed was Jessie Frazelle's writing and speaking about running everything in Docker on her laptop and Sacha Chua's love for Emacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677608</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent decision by Matt Mullenweg to shut down the WordPress Sustainability Team, which has sparked significant backlash within the WordPress community. Critics argue that this move undermines efforts to make the platform more environmentally friendly and threatens the broader mission of promoting sustainable practices. The article highlights various responses from community members who are disappointed with the decision and emphasizes concerns over the future of sustainability initiatives within WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a piece yesterday about the recent WordPress drama, including this bit. A fun thing I learned while digging into it is that Mullenweg himself requested that the Slack channel for this team be set up live on stage at WordCamp Europe in 2022. When disbanding the team, Mullenweg said, “today I learned that we have a sustainability team”. Maybe he forgot, but setting up this team was — at least in part — his idea.https://anderegg.ca/2025/01/11/wordpress-is-in-trouble&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't really understand what a "WP Sustainability Team" was, so I clicked the link to the linked website in this story. I was surprised that it was in fact an initiative to do things like "have a dashboard that shows the climate impact of publishing" and "promote static publishing over..." I assume because serving this content (under someone's model) uses less electricity?Hey - if this is important to you, by all means pursue this direction, but I would cut this sort of initiative too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher has described Matt Mullenweg’s move to shut down WordPress’s sustainability team as “bizarrely heinous behavior.”Is it bizarrely heinous? Or is it just kind of bad? I enjoy WordPress drama, and run a couple of lazy WordPress services, but I don't think that this is actually worth all the spilt ink and tears, relative to all the other injustices a person might choose to concern themselves with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672675</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Microsoft Bob, an early attempt by Microsoft to create a user-friendly graphical interface for Windows in the mid-1990s. Aimed at non-technical users, Bob featured a cartoonish design and a simple layout with an emphasis on ease of use. However, it faced significant criticism for being overly simplistic and not meeting the needs of its target audience, which contributed to its poor sales and eventual discontinuation. The article positions Microsoft Bob as one of the company's most notable product failures, highlighting its ambitious intent overshadowed by its execution shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft never really left the dream of creating Bob behind. If you look at their Virtual Reality Portal it is basically a modern version of Bob where you start in a livingroom and need to go into into other rooms to perform certain task. To start apps you eg. need to pick them from a book shelf. Essential the same a Bob.A few images for reference. Notice that you start MS Paint same way in the VR portal and Bob.VR Portal:
https://onewindows.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/windows-mix...Bob: https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/upl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had Bob in an attempt to make my technophobic mother capable of using the computer.My main memory of it was that it allowed you to add shortcuts to other installed programs, so I added the few games on the computer to Bob. This used way too many resources, causing Bob to crash and me being unable to get into my profile to fix it. It may have broken the program for anyone else using it too, I can't recall. Relatively standard behavior crashing the program far beyond their target market's ability to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimmed it quickly and saw it taught Racket to teach programming design.I've worked at a coding bootcamp in 2017. And I have to say, I was a bit jealous. Where I was learning through methods at university that were a bit quaint, my students learned JS with the latest frameworks. And sure, you can argue whether the length of 3 months is enough, but they were surely getting a better education. What they learned in 3 months, took me at least 6 months to a year in terms of how useful it is.The thing is, especially as a beginner, learning any programming language will give you similar difficulties (glossing over some nuances). So why not just learn a practical one?I think once a student has had a practical programming course under their belt, only after that should more esoteric languages come to showcase certain concepts. I believe that they'd be more motivated to learn them as they're more into the groove of programming.And this is coming from someone that has programmed 2 years in Pharo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676928</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the famous wager between economist Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich regarding the future availability of natural resources and the impact of population growth on scarcity. Simon argued that human ingenuity and technological advancements would lead to resource abundance, while Ehrlich maintained that growing populations would deplete resources. The outcome of the bet, which focused on the prices of specific metals over a decade, ultimately favored Simon, illustrating the resilience of supply in the face of increasing demand and highlighting the role of innovation in resource management. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding population dynamics and resource distribution in addressing environmental and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's only one core problem in AI worth solving for most startups building AI powered software: context.No matter how good the AI gets, it can't answer about what it doesn't know.  It can't perform a process for which it doesn't know the steps or the rules.No LLM is going to know enough about some new drug in a pharma's pipeline, for example, because it doesn't know about the internal resources spread across multiple systems in an enterprise.  (And if you've ever done a systems integration in any sufficiently large enterprise, you know that this is a "people problem" and usually not a technical problem).I think the startups that succeed will understand that it all comes down to classic ETL: identify the source data, understand how to navigate systems integration, pre-process and organize the knowledge, train or fine-tune a model or have the right retrieval model to provide the context.There's fundamentally no other way.  AI is not magic; it can't know about trial ID 1354.006 except for what it was trained on and what it can search for.  Even coding assistants like Cursor are really solving a problem of  ETL/context and will always be.  The code generation is the smaller part; getting it right requires providing the appropriate context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this argument only makes sense if you believe that AGI and/or unbounded AI agents are "right around the corner".  For sure, we will progress in that direction, but when and if we truly get there–who knows?If you believe, as I do, that these things are a lot further off than some people assume, I think there's plenty of time to build a successful business solving domain-specific workflows in the meantime, and eventually adapting the product as more general technology becomes available.Let's say 25 years ago you had the idea to build a product that can now be solved more generally with LLMs–let's say a really effective spam filter.  Even knowing what you know now, would it have been right at the time to say, "Nah, don't build that business, it will eventually be solved with some new technology?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one thing ignored here is the value of UX.If a general AI model is a "drop-in remote worker", then UX matters not at all, of course. I would interact with such a system in the same way I would one of my colleagues and I would also give a high level of trust to such a system.If the system still requires human supervision or works to augment a human worker's work (rather than replace it), then a specific tailored user interface can be very valuable, even if the product is mostly just a wrapper of an off-the-shelf model.After all, many SaaS products could be built on top of a general CRM or ERP, yet we often find a vertical-focused UX has a lot to offer. You can see this in the AI space with a product like Julius.The article seems to assume that most of the value brought by AI startups right now is adding domain-specific reliability, but I think there's plenty of room to build great experiences atop general models that will bring enduring value.If and when we reach AGI (the drop-in remote worker referenced in the article), then I personally don't see how the vast majorities of companies - software and others - are relevant at all. That just seems like a different discussion, not one of business strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672790</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat! A couple gameplay suggestions I would have is that while the game does pretty well figuring out which word I'm typing sometimes I will get "locked" on a word that I decide I don't actually want to complete (for example, if something is coming at me faster). And, while probably intentional, sometimes I just can't see words or there is some delay in when they actually get destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games like this based on an existing skill would really benefit from the ability to start at higher levels. I'm a pretty proficient typist, it'd be a lot more interesting to me if there was any risk at all of me failing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The game doesn't penalize wrong key presses. I made an automation cheat for it back in Dec 2013!    import java.awt.*;

        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

            Robot rob = new Robot();
            Point prevLoc = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation();
            while (MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation().equals(prevLoc)) {
                for (int i = 'A'; i &lt;= 'Z'; i++) {
                    rob.keyPress(i);

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of invariants in programming, providing a detailed explanation of their importance in ensuring the correctness and reliability of algorithms. It clarifies what invariants are—conditions that remain true during the execution of a program or a portion of it—and discusses various types of invariants, such as loop invariants and class invariants. The author emphasizes the role of invariants in facilitating reasoning about code behavior, aids in debugging, and contributes to effective software design by promoting a clear understanding of how data and states are maintained throughout the program's lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure that I agree with the article.In the course of my work, I think of an invariant as a state that must hold true at all points during the software’s execution.For example, “port xxx must never accept inbound traffic”.I don’t think of invariants as mindsets; I think of them as runtime requirements that are observable and testable at any point during execution, and whose violation is an indication that some assumption about state that the proper execution of the software depends on, no longer holds.Maybe a good analogy would be “a runtime assert”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that the Ada language features baked-in pre- and post-condition invariants as a part of a function's signature. It goes beyond just runtime assertions by becoming a part of the function's contract with callers.https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/cont...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another way to view such invariant is to see it as a generalization of both pre-  as well as post-condition.The pre-condition is a special case, then the invariant provides the "guard rails" along which the computation proceeds, and then the post-condition is again a special case which ultimately is the result of the computation.In the search example of the computation, the pre-condition is "the position is somewhere in the allowed indices", the post-condition is "the return value is the position". The stated invariant is "the value is between current min and max bounds". These bounds become tighter and tighter, so that eventually the pre-condition is transformed into the post-condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640178</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a phone with a limited version of Android (Android Go) and only 2GB of RAM which isn't enough. It has a slow CPU, it lacks 5G connectivity which is more and more important just to have good reception. It comes with at most 2 years of security updates. It has 32GB of storage which quickly fill up if you take pictures every now and then.If you can afford it, get something like the Samsung A52 5G with 7 years of updates and 6GB or 8GB of RAM. If that's too expensive, get one from the list when it's on sale: https://skinflint.co.uk/?cat=umtsover&amp;v=e&amp;hloc=uk&amp;sort=p&amp;bl1...These are recently released phones with 6GB RAM or more and Android 14+ starting at £99. 6GB of RAM means you can use your phone for a couple of years without it getting super slow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the issue with these low end devices are that the duopoly on operating systems makes it impossible to develop a competing operating system that get's any traction.I am 100% sure you, as a manufacturer, could develop a very lightweight shim over a linux or BSD kernel that has significantly better performance than Android does. It would however be a universal flop regardless of how useable it is since critical apps like WhatsApp/Telegram/banking would not get ported to that platform ever.That effectively leaves you with needing a capable web browser and well... Even Firefox with every form of adblocker enable regularly chews up 2-3 GB of ram for me, at least on desktop. And building a competitive web browser to Chromium is an absurd endeavour for a cheap cell manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HMD is a mobile phone brand; "Key" is a line of phones.I thought it was something like a YubiKey, but it appears instead to be a really cheap phone running Android Go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673090</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am Brazilian-Australian, worked for a few years in Australia and then moved to Sweden and worked for an American company here.The company was Swedish, but was eventually acquired by an American corporation.One of the projects we were working on started getting delayed due to endless discussions about which tech to use and how to architect things (the companies used completely different stacks) so we could integrate everything. One day, we had a video call with one big Manager from Florida. The guy just started shouting like a maniac and treated everyone, including us and his American team, like crap.That was so incredibly surreal to everyone on our side, as even the tiniest raising of your voice in our office would've been extremely unusual, and Swedes are one of the most conflict-avoiding people you can find anywhere. After the call was over, everyone was all thinking like "what the fuck just happened" but no one said much at all... we just  kind of pretended that did not happen and slowly went back to playing some ping pong and calmly sitting at our desks and doing some work with headphones on.After a few months, only I was left on the team as everyone just found elsewhere to work.... I followed a couple of months after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an additional issue with timezones I'm surprised he didn't mention - you're off by a day. This means nobody is around on your Monday because it's US Sunday and conversely US Friday is your Saturday morning. This means you either need to adapt to having 4 days a week of overlap, or you need to shift your life to accomodate 7am meetings on a Saturday morning.There's also regular chaos with the mis-matched DST windows meaning meetings will swing about by 1-2 hours multiple times as the seasons change depending on whose calendar created them, it's manageable but inevitably there's misses and confusion or someone's 8am suddenly becomes a 6am without rescheduling.The bigger issue however is if you're the AU leg of a global firm with a US plurality: If there are teams in the UK or EU for example there's simply no way of operating with overlap that doesn't involve someone regularly having meetings in the deeply inhospitable early hours of the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If I lived in San Francisco, I’d have ~100x more available jobs to apply to if I lost my current one.In some sense this also fits under culture. The Australian government has historically been fairly technophobic (they really have a thing against privacy - the ban on effective encryption springs to mind, they've tried to ban Monero too but that doesn't work because crypto is too slippery). I also vaguely recall from years ago that we make it hard to use equity as a significant part of employee compensation. Overall Australia lacks the free-wheeling spirit of letting people do things that works so well in tech so I assume there are a lot of other small barriers I don't know about (eg, I'd bet companies like Uber would have been killed in the crib if it started in Australia). We also have a subtly anti-cheap-energy policy that must make life hard for data centres.We've produced some big tech success stories like Atlassian but when you combine dubious regulation with the larger US capital markets there isn't really much to recommend about Australia. I wouldn't suggest putting money into the Australian tech scene and the market has probably sniffed that out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669681</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Case for Letting Malibu Burn" argues that the natural cycle of wildfires is an essential aspect of California's ecosystem, particularly in areas like Malibu, where human intervention has increased fire risks and altered the landscape. It discusses the historical relationship between fire and the region's ecology, suggesting that allowing certain areas to burn can promote ecological health and prevent more destructive wildfires in the future. The piece also addresses the complex issues of property rights, environmental policy, and the increasing threat of climate change, calling for a reevaluation of fire management practices to prioritize ecological resilience over human development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; So why do people insist on rebuilding in the firebelt?Why do Floridians keep rebuilding in the wake of endless hurricanes? Why do folks live in Tornado Alley? Why do Dakotans endure one tragic winter after another? Why did New Orleans build back after yhe flooding?Man seeks to tame nature - to bend it to our will. Plus we'll take "build now, great views now" over "possible disaster later ".One could argue that nowhere is completely risk free, but it seems like the homing instinct (Plus the cultural instinct to build out of wood) is strong.It might be time to consider alternate building methods suitable for the risk of the area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So instead of a long-overdue debate about the wisdom of rebuilding and the need to prevent further construction in areas of extreme natural fire danger, public attention was diverted into a discussion of the best methods for clearing vegetation (rototillers or goats?) and making homes fire-resistant.Does anyone honestly think that debate has any actual chance of hapenning, even now? Malibu and the Pacific Palisades are some of the best real estate in the state if not the country. There’s always going to be someone willing to pay the rising cost of fire insurance and take the risk to live there. Short of the state buying out all the property owners or making that area uninsurable by CalFAIR, people are going to build. Not to mention the political connections they have.Altadena, on the other hand, was built where and how it was built because of segregationist redlining in Pasadena and South Pasadena. It’s a historically minority neighborhood that was only built so densely with so little fire protection because they couldn’t afford it and the state never gave them much help. It looks like once again our power companies are responsible for starting a destructive conflagration because they siphoned maintenance money to shareholders and executives (many of whom probably live in Malibu or the Palisades). Any state policy that tries to solve the Malibu/Palisades problem is going to disproportionately screw these low income communities that have built out around the edges. I’m betting that entire neighborhood will sell out to real estate developers building apartment complexes that can afford more expensive fire mitigations, destroying a historical community as much as any freeway and opening the door to tenement fires.This has all happened before and will happen again. I don’t really see a holistic solution that has any chance of passing public scrutiny and working, other than chipping away at the insurance regulator and CalFAIR, which will screw over the most vulnerable and entrench the real estate NIMBYs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It certainly feels like the need for climate change adaptation that's been foretold for years is starting to happen. There’s quite a bit of blame being thrown around regarding details like how much water was in the reservoir and the DEI stance of the fire chief, but does any of that really provide a sustainable solution?Maybe it’s time to confront the fact that people can’t continue to live in those areas without substantial changes in the build environment.The tragic reality of climate change is that despite well informed and well meaning people, no one actually wants to meaningfully change their own lifestyle to adjust to the consequences. Clear cutting trees for instance, can be a preventative measure, but I'm sure home owners in the area would protest the environmental impact, the loss of privacy, the change in their lifestyle.California has always been a state that, on paper, acknowledges the severity  of climate change, but thus far, has been fighting tooth and nail to keep homes in wildfire prone areas. What I worry about is that California chooses to create a public option for homeowners insurance that is tax payer funded to subsidize at risk homes, increasing costs for everyone else. To me this would just be another form of climate change denial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675274</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why you wouldn't deploy a spar horizontally, filled with dry ballast powder evenly along it's length, then tip it vertical once in position and pump in water to set the ballast. This seems an obvious approach, allowing use of a shallow dock ,so there must be some issue with it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this works, then why is tidal power not more widely used?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the designs presented for floating  oceanic wind turbine bases shows, that there is a need to have as much stability as possible, while
moving in response to wave action and tides.By default, all power generating equipment is 100% duty cycle , 24/7/365. For fixed land based machines the various loads and environmental wear
conditions are more or less predictable. Marine instalations on the other hand, are notorious for destroying anything and everything, very especialy
anything with moving parts, due to all of the land based factors, plus operating on an unpredictable moving platform.
 Total failure of the entire structure can be initiated by the failure of any one of many bearings/joints where movement between components takes place,deep underwater.
 Inspection becomes a challenge and service at sea impossible.
 The many failures of underwater tidal generators
bears testimony to the dificulties and challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655207</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a group of physicists advocating for a re-evaluation of the concept of dark energy, which is currently used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. They propose that instead of assuming the existence of dark energy, we should consider alternative theories of gravity that could potentially account for observational data without invoking this elusive substance. The physicists argue that by exploring these alternative frameworks, we might gain a deeper understanding of fundamental physics and the nature of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark energy and dark matter aren't really theories. They are sort of the default solution to a set of problems that exist in cosmology. In a sense, every physicist wants to ditch dark matter or dark energy (or at least our current understandings of them), but they just don't know what to replace them with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the better nautilus articles I’ve read, usually they’re unreadable and boring, despite an interesting title. Unsurprising that it was written by Sabine Hossenfelder. Good science communication is a real skill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every science documentary I've watched tells me most physicists want to ditch "dark energy" because it's a placeholder term for something we still don't understand yet.  Map-makers didn't actually believe there were dragons after all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672752</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you very much for this project, not only because it looks nice but also to have created with a long lost spirit: "I do something nice for myself and I share it with the world" open source, and doing something straight simple with dependency!I wish more things are released like that.Also your tool might be very useful because there isn't a good Gantt tool that is lightweight anymore, i search for one recently and my only solution in the end was to use an excel template...My 2 feedbacks if you are interested:
- it is annoying to have the "category" required to create a task. Maybe you could create a task with an "undefined" category if none provided?
- a great feature would be to be able to export the result output or view in a PNG picture or SVG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's really nice, such a good idea.Over the last 15 years the browser has become more and more of an application delivery platform, and that notion has caused SaaS to run basically everything.I realised this not too long ago, and incidentally it was due to gantt software.We, like everyone it seems, use Jira for issue tracking, but the actual roadmapping of resources and dependencies leaves a lot to be desired, tools like Microsoft Project are not only prohibitively expensive- they also don't work on MacOS.Similar issues can be levied at Omnigraph.Only SaaS tools like "InstaGantt" seem to fit the bill of cross-platform, lightweight and reasonably cost effective.Note: I'm currently not using Instagantt, despite it being the closest to good I could find, because I dislike subscriptions. :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me a little bit of https://markwhen.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been programming some CAD algorithms during the last two months and found myself buying cheap pens for a cheap plotter (a Silhouette machine), to make geometric diagrams. Can't say that the process is more efficient than a color printer[^1], but it is way cheaper than those damn color toners and the profit-maximizing ways the printer accounts for its consumption. And the pen strokes on paper look cool, and one can chose different pens to draw different layers in the diagrams.[^1]: Though, in truth, the plotter is extremely reliable and fast. Inkjet printers on the other hand have a lengthy warmup and drivers are finicky to the point one imagines they constantly are on the lookout for new ways to botch a job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used a standard Lamy fountain pen for 11 years in school, and later several higher-end products (ball pens and fountain pens). But a few years ago I discovered that I really like writing with the Bic Cristal [0]. It's reliable and writing feels very smooth (even better than with some Lamy products I own). I also like that it has exactly the same shape as a classic pencil. Of course it is also very relaxing to know I can get a pack of 50 for 14 EUR. You can gnaw away on it, roll over it accidentally with you chair, lose it, break it in half - doesn't matter, because you can easily afford to have 20 of these on your desk at any time.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_Cristal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had quite a few nice pens over the years. For me, Lamy Safari with its triangular grip is peak ergonomics, and its price-per-usability is fantastic. I tend to have a claw-like grip, and the Safari forces me to hold it in a way that my hand doesn't cramp after 3 minutes. It's great. I love it.But for quick jotting, like making shopping lists or bullet journal notetaking, I'm on board with this list's top ballpoint pick, the Uni Jetstream. If all ballpoints were this smooth and pleasant to use, I never would've bothered investigating fountain pens. I think they're fantastic, supremely reasonably priced, and rugged enough to lose in the bottom of a bag without leaking all over stuff.I love my Safaris, but when I need to jot something down, I reach for the Jetstream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676274</guid></item><item><title>49.

The second one hasn't just added a bitcoin, it has also added the "AI shimmer" that seems to be a part of a lot of generated images. I can't put my finger on exactly what the characteristic is, but my first instinct (separate from the bitcoin, which was hard to find) is "that's an AI picture." Someone should just spend some time in the blur tool if they don't like those glints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you zoom in and squint your eyes, it does look like some kind of shiny coin.What I'd like to know though... is how is the model so bad that when you tell it to "remove this artifact" ... instead of it looking at the surroundings and painting over with some DoF-ed out ocean... it slaps an even more distinct artifact in there?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An old manager of mine once spent the day trying to kill a process that was running at 99% on Windows box.When I finally got round to see what he was doing I was disappointed to find he was attempting to kill the 'system idle' process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't feel like reading 4 times is necessarily a portable solution, if there will be more versions at different speeds and different I/O architectures; or how this will work under more load, and whether the original change was done to fix some other performance problem OP is not aware of, but not sure what else can be done.  Unfortunately many vendors like Marvell can seriously under-document crucial features like this.  If anything it would be good to put some of this info in the comment itself, not very elegant but how else practically are we meant to keep track of this, is the mailing list part of the documentation?Doesn't look like there's a lot of discussion on the mailing list, but I don't know if I'm reading the thread view correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the late 1990's I worked in a company that had a couple mainframes in their fleet and once I looked into a resource usage screen (Omegamon, perhaps? Is it that old?) and noticed the CPU was pegged at 100%. I asked the operator if that was normal. His answer was "Of course. We paid for that CPU, might as well use it". Funny though that mainframes are designed for that - most, if not all, non-application work is offloaded to other processors in the system so that the CPU can run applications as fast as it can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649862</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Debugging: Twenty Ourths Explained" by David A. Wheeler explores common misconceptions about debugging software. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the debugging process beyond just fixing code, highlighting that debugging often involves complex problem-solving and critical thinking skills. The text dispels twenty myths related to debugging, such as the belief that debugging can be automated, that experience is the main predictor of debugging success, and that debugging is merely the responsibility of testers. By addressing these myths, the article seeks to improve understanding of debugging's true nature and encourage better practices in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, the most pernicious temptation is to take the buggy, non-working code you have now and to try to modify it with "fixes" until the code works. In my experience, you often cannot get broken code to become working code because there are too many possible changes to make. In my view, it is much easier to break working code than it is to fix broken code.Suppose you have a complete chain of N Christmas lights and they do not work when turned on. The temptation is to go through all the lights and to substitute in a single working light until you identify the non-working light.But suppose there are multiple non-working lights? You'll never find the error with this approach. Instead, you need to start with the minimal working approach -- possibly just a single light (if your Christmas lights work that way), adding more lights until you hit an error. In fact, the best case is if you have a broken string of lights and a similar but working string of lights! Then you can easily swap a test bulb out of the broken string and into the working chain until you find all the bad bulbs in the broken string.Starting with a minimal working example is the best way to fix a bug I have found. And you will find you resist this because you believe that you are close and it is too time-consuming to start from scratch. In practice, it tends to be a real time-saver, not the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule 0: Don't panicReally, that's important. You need to think clearly, deadlines and angry customers are a distraction. That's also when having a good manager who can trust you is important, his job is to shield you from all that so that you can devote all of your attention to solving the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For #4 (divide and conquer), I've found `git bisect` helps a lot. If you have a known good commit and one of dozens or hundreds of commits after that is bad, this can help you identify the bad commit / code in a few steps.Here's a walk through on using it: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/using-git-bisect-to-help-find...I jumped into a pretty big unknown code base in a live consulting call and we found the problem pretty quickly using this method. Without that, the scope of where things could be broken was too big given the context (unfamiliar code base, multiple people working on it, only able to chat with 1 developer on the project, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682602</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I immediately assumed this article was about the French movie Le Corniaud (1965) in which a 2CV falls apart in 250 pieces in an accident—this scene specifically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnLj5Xo4zBc&amp;t=19s It became one of the most iconic scene of French comedy movies. To prepare the scene, the special effects engineer sawed off the car in 250 pieces, reattached every piece with hooks, and secured the hooks with "explosive bolts". At the right moment, the actor driving the car pushed a button to trigger the (tiny) explosives which made the car fall apart. Here is a French article about it: https://2cv-legende.com/expo-de-la-2cv-du-film-le-corniaud-a...PS: the French wikipedia article on the movie has a picture of the explosive bolts they used: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corniaud#L'accident_de_la_2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don't know, Keaton was amazingly dedicated as a comedic stuntman - a silent era Jackie Chan (he was less popular after the silent era, but kept working until his death in the 60s).From Wikipedia: Garry Moore recalled, "I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you.' He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that's how he did it—it hurt—but you had to care enough not to care." This would have been in about 1955, when Keaton (born 1899) was an old man and well past his heyday of really dangerous stunts (he once broke his neck during an early stunt).And he usually had an amazing commitment to film in a lot of other ways. The first time he was shot in a film he took a camera apart to figure out how it worked, because he really cared about every detail (though in the middle of his career this really hurt him, as execs wanted to just trot him up in front of the camera as a high paid celebrity - they didn't want him wasting his valuable time fussing over details, or risk their investment letting him do stunts).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those reasons seem to make sense but I'd say just as much has to do with Buster Keaton himself, he had nerves of steel.During the filming of the Civil War movie The General there are images of Keaton doing things that even the bravest of stuntmen wouldn't do these days and we'd now rely on film animation and tricks to make the scenes work.For instance, Keaton—who obviously was very fit and agile—is filmed sitting on a cowcatcher of a moving locomotive whilst removing rail ties that were placed on the line to impede the train's progress and then tossing them aside.I read somewhere that Clyde Bruckman the film's director gave instructions to the cameraman "to keep filming the scene until finished or until Keaton is killed" or words to that effect.I can't remember whether Bruckman was referring to this scene or another such as when he's running across the locomotive's tender (the comment could equally have applied to many other scenes I reckon). Others who are more knowledgeable could perhaps fill in the details.I like this movie, Keaton was a
great performer and his movies are a testament to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42679127</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Paul Graham discusses the concept of "wokeness," critiquing its impact on society, particularly in relation to free speech, creativity, and the startup culture. Graham argues that the rise of wokeness leads to a culture of fear and self-censorship, stifling open discourse and innovation. He highlights how this movement can be counterproductive, as it often targets individuals for their views rather than fostering genuine debate and understanding. Graham ultimately advocates for a more tolerant approach that encourages diverse perspectives and real conversations rather than conformity to ideological norms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the word “woke” means very different things to some people.As an example I think people from the American political left to somewhere(?) in the middle see it as what it has been introduced as, that being looking past the status quo and instead looking at your own values, i.e. the morality of homelessness and not having a disdain for them but empathy for them instead.and then on the other side it feels like the people on the American political right see it as what this website describes it as “ A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others.”I think the divide has originated from taking unlikeable behaviour and labeling that as ‘woke’ (in bad faith of course) and some people have just bonded to that definition so much that they see it as that.At least that’s what I’ve noticed online over the past few (bonkers) years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Imagine having to explain to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the phrase "people of color" is considered particularly enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. [...] There are no underlying principles.To understand much of our language, Gnorts would have to already be aware that our words and symbols gain meaning from how they're used, and you couldn't, for instance, determine that a swastika is offensive (in the west) by its shape alone.In this case, the term "colored people" gained racist connotations from its history of being used for discrimination and segregation - and avoiding it for that reason is the primary principle at play. There's also the secondary/less universal principle of preferring "person-first language".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to political correctness was precisely that — they were student movements. They didn't have any real power.

I don't know what Graham thinks 'political correctness' would have looked like in the 1960s – most Americans still thought women's lib was a joke, many Americans were fighting to preserve segregation, and nobody had heard of such a thing as a gay rights movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682305</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses standard patterns observed in choice-based games, focusing on how players make decisions that can affect gameplay and narrative outcome. It examines the mechanics of choice in games, highlighting the significance of player agency and the influence of design on player behavior. The author analyzes specific examples from various games to illustrate these patterns and emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics for both game design and player experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. I've been a game dev for about 30 years, much of which I've spent working with narrative design/writing teams. One thing I've learned to watch out for, especially among junior designers, is what the author labels the "Time Cave."Narrative branching, done well, is fantastic—it gives the player agency and lets them make the story their own (as it were). But when you're creating the story graph, it's easy to get lost in it and lavish care on one path at the exclusion of the others. You can easily end up with one or two long, greatly-detailed paths, and (because dev time is finine, and you need to move on to writing other parts of the game) a pile of other paths that are shorter and less interesting. If the player takes one of the shorter ones, they end up missing out on all your coolest stuff. The tools I would design for the kinds of games I created specifically made it easy to create a main story trunk with side paths (that rejoined the trunk), and more difficult to branch/loop/etc.Of course, that's not the only (or even the best) way to do narrative design—Disco Elysium is a masterwork because it did the branching, merching, loops, jumps, random checks, and so forth, so well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always nice to share: the Grim Fandango Puzzle Document (pdf): http://gameshelf.jmac.org/2008/11/13/GrimPuzzleDoc_small.pdfPerfect example of the "Branch and Bottleneck".It even includes similar graphics at the start of each act.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fun, and holds true in the creative writing group I run. We use a website I programmed that helps us collaborate on writing branching fiction. We have a mapping utility that creates graphs like in the article, except more animated (d3.js, elkjs).As different authors can start their own new stories, one thing I often have to deal with is that they want to design their story to have both long path lengths (multiple chapters before an ending), and also high choice count. Those of you who know something about geometric series know that this causes problems. I often have to tell them they can't have everything they want, which causes minor drama. :)As a result, one of our stories basically shot its "choice budget" in the first few chapters, leading to many linear paths in the latter parts of the narratives, which is fun in its own way.Another of our stories has just started playing with the "gauntlet pattern" as the article describes. For this one, we decided that all chapters must be in the "same universe", just following different characters' perspectives, and are planning for certain "anchor chapters" where all characters come together for a meeting. Probably the detective questioning them as a group (it's a murder mystery).All of our stories are supposed to be literary, so usually in third person, sometimes first, never the second-person. So we don't tend to use choices and chapters as directions and rooms; it's all about how the plot moves. We also don't track state; they're designed to be able to be printed as books people can page through.Overall a super-fun project for me and a handful of other writers, it's been a consistent way to spend a few hours of fun each week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678647</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "root access" in the context of technology and computing, emphasizing the importance of users having control over their own devices and software. It argues for the right to root access as a fundamental aspect of digital autonomy and security, allowing users to customize and optimize their systems to meet personal needs. The piece highlights the implications of denying root access, such as increased vulnerability to security breaches and reliance on manufacturers for updates and support. Overall, it advocates for greater transparency and user empowerment in digital environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a ton of products on the market that are vastly more dangerous than computers: guns, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, chainsaws, table saws, cigarettes, alcohol, junk food. Yes, consumers do sometimes harm themselves by using these products. That's the price of freedom. I think it's bizarre that we treat computers as the most dangerous products in the world that for some reason demand paternalism, when none of these other products are locked down by the vendor.The reason that computers are locked down by the vendors is not that computers are somehow more dangerous than other things we buy. The reason is simply that it's technically possible to lock down computers, and vendors have found that it's massively, MASSIVELY profitable to do so. It's all about protecting their profits, not protecting us. We know that the crApp Store is full of scams that steal literally millions of dollars from consumers, and we know that the computer vendors violate our privacy by phoning home with "analytics" covering everything we do on the devices. This is not intended for our benefit but rather for theirs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP here. Really glad to see others engaging with this topic, I wrote up this post because I felt like there wasn't anything out there that was advocating for unlocked hardware as part of the discussion on "right to repair".As someone that works in security, I fully understand the need for sane defaults that protect the average user. I even advocate in the article that we should keep these defaults in place for the most part.What I tend to not understand is the argument that there should be no option for more enterprising users to access their hardware at the lowest levels because we need to protect the average consumer. It may be a footgun for some, but that's sort of the point. I expect to be able to modify something I own, whether it's to my detriment or not.My argument isn't that root access should be the default, but at the very least it should be an option. I just don't think it's right that we've normalized corporations blocking the ability to load / inspect software, which often is marketed as a safety or privacy thing, but is arguably more a business decision meant to protect profit margins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I detest Google, but I do think they made the right call with Android devices and Chromebooks. You can unlock either as long as you are willing to totally wipe the device first and start over as a new device under a new security context.This removes the risk of this being abused to compromise the data of stolen devices or evil maid attacks unless a user that knows what they are doing has explicitly opted themselves into that risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677835</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the wiki -- I have always been interested in hardware hacking but I have always felt overwhelmed as I didn't know where to start. I believe this kind of resource can greatly help with that, especially the case studies.However, I can't help but feel that a major part of the content is LLM-generated, or at least LLM-rewritten. It feels off and uninteresting to read, honestly. Is it the case? To support my case, I see that the case study page (https://www.hardbreak.wiki/introduction/case-study-led-to-a-...) has very similar paragraphs next to each other, the second one seemingly being the "genuine" one, and the first one being the LLM-rewritten version.I'm not against using LLMs to help fix typos or reformulate things, but you should definitely keep some of your style. The LLM that you used (if you used one) made the content super bland, and as a reader, I'm not really incentivized to browse more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately not Open Source, in the common definition of the word.From the license.md [0] page, under "Terms":&gt; Exemptions: Commercial Use: For inquiries regarding commercial use, please contact the author.[0] https://github.com/f3nter/HardBreak/blob/fd3d2d4cd17624a3f62...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shameless plug: For anybody wanting to get into rockchip SoC development I've created a (no AI) resource: https://danielc.dev/rk/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672821</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I played the Linux version the article mentions while at Goldman Sachs; a colleague on the Red Hat coverage team gave me a boxed copy of Corel Linux including the game. The port ran very well on my Red Hat Linux box at home.In retrospect it was part of a brief flurry of Linux ports of major games. I also got to play Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Neverwinter Nights; in both cases the publishers made Linux clients available for download that use the retail version's assets. Despite the valiant efforts of Wine and related projects, the world would have to wait 15 more years before Proton leveraged Wine technology to bring quasi-native games to Linux, and 20 years before Steam Deck made it the norm or close to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In this reviewer’s opinion, it was a sparkling creative success as well as a commercial one, making it all the more deserving of remembrance. We’ve seen a fair number of train games built on similar premises in the years since 1998, but I don’t know that we’ve ever seen a comprehensively better one.RRT2 is my all time favorite game, and has yet to find a spiritual successor in my heart. Alongside Anno 1602, it may be the oldest PC game I regularly open up and play for fun.The gameplay is still so good. The fact that the game is so open-ended and also so cutthroat, combined with the procedurally generated maps means it always feels fresh to play, even all these years later. The UI has aged but has not gotten in the way.And yes, as reviewer describes, it absolutely nails the theme. The sound design, the visuals, the music, the historical setting. Things feel gritty and real and tough. Just like the game's treatment of Robber Barons, the game perfectly balances romanticism with cynicism. The game made me love trains.I still remember learning as a child how stock trading on the margin worked when I simultaneously made and then lost a massive fortune attempting to buy out a rival.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still keep this on my box and crack it open now and again.   I also pulled the music out of the distro and put it into my listening rotation while working.   You have to add your own hawk screech sounds though :-)I’m a total sucker for network optimization train games though.   Love the crayon rails games which I wrote about here:https://dave.org/posts/20221206_trains/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657585</guid></item><item><title>9.

The movie is split into roughly 1min sections, with each one done by a different creator. The quality is all over the place, in a hilarious way. One minute it's produced by a professional animator nailing the scenes, then the next minute it's people goofing around in their backyard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I drew a few frames in this, but it was a real shame to see how little quality control there was in the final cut. Makes it kind of unwatchable.Progress near the end was really fast, as lots of people had caught on and were racing to get as many frames in as possible.I really don't think this concept has been worn out yet, and someone could make their own version of this with a small review step and then we'd get some fun, actually watchable hand-drawn movies :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Artists in Europe have already been fighting to protect the copyright of Tintin to keep the artwork away from large language models (LLMs) training various AI algorithms.There is no copyright in the character anymore, so there’s nothing to protect.I really do not understand this perspective.  Do people also wish to use legal force to prevent others from working with, for example, Gainsborough, or Moliere, or Julius Caesar, or Homer?  Come on: at some point something has to enter the public domain and become part of the shared treasure of all mankind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to a Hacker News comment, my kids, ages 7-13. Have been watching an episode of Tintin from the internet archive every week, and they love it. Link: https://archive.org/details/tintinseries43&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post about Tintin, one of my top childhood influences. I have a new edition of all the albums (much better than mine) unopened and ready for when my kid grows enough. The TV show wasn't so good IMHO - of course the narrative was great because it came from the comics, but animation quality was just so-so, or at least that's how I remember it.If you liked Tintin and long for more comics of the same kind, I recommend you to try Blake and Mortimer. They're different (e.g. with a more serious and wordy style, hardly any comical gags, but also with more fantastic elements). But they are the closest I know, and in some aspects even better (I personally prefer them although I'm aware it's due to very subjective factors, most people would still rank Tintin higher overall and Blake and Mortimer don't have such a universal acclaim).The only thing I dislike about the post is the gratuitous rant on AI at the end. It is great news that Tintin joins the public domain. Especially great because it's one of these cases where the owners have been especially abusive, chasing fan efforts done as a labor of love, lest they harm their sales of overpriced merchandising.Why exactly should be worry about people generating AI images of Tintin? What is the harm done? We know what the original albums are, they will probably be preserved as long as there is human civilization (despite copyright, not thanks to it), and we can freely decide if we also want to read/watch/see derivative works (and which) or not. I just don't see the problem at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651043</guid></item><item><title>11. Entropy of a Large Language Model output</title><link>https://nikkin.dev/blog/llm-entropy.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of entropy in large language models (LLMs) and how it relates to the predictability of generated text. It explains that understanding entropy can help improve the performance and effectiveness of LLMs, highlighting the balance between randomness and coherence in text generation. Furthermore, the blog post explores the implications of entropy on model training and evaluation, offering insights into how adjusting entropy can influence the quality of output and the potential for innovative applications in natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649315"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are observing "flattened logits" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774#page=12&amp;org=openai .The entropy of ChatGPT (as well as all other generative models which have been 'tuned' using RLHF, instruction-tuning, DPO, etc) is so low because it is not predicting "most likely tokens" or doing compression. A LLM like ChatGPT has been turned into an RL agent which seeks to maximize reward by taking the optimal action. It is, ultimately, predicting what will manipulate the imaginary human rater into giving it a high reward.So the logits aren't telling you anything like 'what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token', but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model's belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an 'action' and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text). This reduction in entropy is a standard RL effect as agents switch from exploration to exploitation: there is no benefit to taking anything less than the single best action, so you don't want to risk taking any others.This is also why completions are so boring and Boltzmann temperature stops mattering and more complex sampling strategies like best-of-N don't work so well: the greedy logit-maximizing removes information about interesting alternative strategies, so you wind up with massive redundancy and your net 'likelihood' also no longer tells you anything about the likelihood.And note that because there is now so much LLM text on the Internet, this feeds back into future LLMs too, which will have flattened logits simply because it is now quite likely that they are predicting outputs from LLMs which had flattened logits. (Plus, of course, data labelers like Scale can fail at quality control and their labelers cheat and just dump in ChatGPT answers to make money.) So you'll observe future 'base' models which have more flattened logits too...I've wondered if to recover true base model capabilities and get logits that actually meaningful predict or encode 'dark knowledge', rather than optimize for a lowest-common-denominator rater reward, you'll have to start dumping in random Internet text samples to get the model 'out of assistant mode'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In LM research, it is more common to measure the exponentiation of the entropy, called perplexity. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an interesting aspect of this behaviour used in the byte latent transformer model.Encoding tokens from source text can be done a number of ways, byte pair encoding, dictionaries etc.You can also just encode text into tokens (or directly into embeddings) with yet another model.The problem arises that if you are doing variable length tokens, how many characters do you put into any particular token, and then because that token must represent the text if you use it for decoding, where do you store count of characters stored in any particular token.The byte latent transformer model solves this by using the entropy for the next character.   A small character model receives the history character by character and predicts the next one.  If the entropy spikes from low to high they count that as a token boundary.   Decoding the same characters from the latent one at a time produces the same sequence and deterministically spikes at the same point in the decoding indicating that it is at the end of the token without the length being required to be explicitly encoded.(disclaimer: My layman's view of it anyway,  I may be completely wrong)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649315</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent outage of Canva and explores themes of system saturation and resilience in digital platforms. It analyzes how high demand can lead to vulnerabilities in online services, highlighting the consequences of such outages for users and businesses reliant on these tools. The author emphasizes the importance of building resilient systems that can withstand unexpected spikes in usage while reflecting on the broader implications for the tech industry and the necessity for better preparedness in the face of similar disruptions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676529"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had a similar CDN problem with releasing major Warframe updates: our CDN partner would inadvertently DDoS our origin servers when we launched an update because thousands of cold edges would call home simultaneously when all players players relogged at the same time.One CDN vendor didn't even offer a tiered distribution system so every edge called home at the same time, another vendor did have a tiered distribution system designed to avoid this problem but it was overwhelmed by the absurd number of files we'd serve multiplied by the large user count and so we'd still end up with too much traffic hitting the origin.The interesting thing was that no vendor we evaluated offered a robust preheating solution if they offered one at all. One vendor even went so far as to say that they wouldn't allow it because it would let customers unfairly dominate the shared storage cache at the edge (which sort of felt like airlines overbooking seats on a flight to me).These days we run an army of VMs that fetch all assets from every point of presence we can cover right before launching an update.Another thing we've had to deal with mentioned in the article is overloading back-end nodes; our solution is somewhat ham-fisted but works quite well for us: we cap the connection counts to the back end and return 503s when we saturate. The trick, however, is getting your load-balancer to leave the client connection open when this happens -- by default multiple LBs we've used would slam the connection closed so that when you're serving up 50K 503s a second the firewall would buckle under the runaway connection pool lingering in TIME_WAIT. Good times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This problem is similar to what electric utilities call "load takeup". After a power outage, when power is turned back on, there are many loads that draw more power at startup.The shortest term effects are power supplies recharging their capacitors and incandescent bulbs warming up. That's over within a second.Then it's the motors, which have 2x-3x their running load when starting as they bring their rotating mass up to speed. That extra load lasts for tens of seconds.If power has been off for more than a few minutes, everything in heating and cooling which normally cycles on and off will want to start. That high load lasts for minutes.Bringing up a power grid is thus done by sections, not all at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole incident report is interesting, but I feel like the most important part of the solution is buried here [0]:* "We're adding timeouts to prevent user requests from waiting excessively long to retrieve assets."When you get to the size of Canva, you can't forget your AbortController and exponential backoff on your Fetch API calls.--0: https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/canva-incident-report...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676529</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the website discusses a collection of 2025 research papers that utilize latent space concepts and techniques in various domains. It provides brief descriptions of the papers, highlighting their contributions, methodologies, and findings. The focus is on the evolving applications of latent space in fields such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, emphasizing the significance of this approach in advancing research and technology. The resource acts as a curated guide for researchers and practitioners interested in the latest developments related to latent spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe that most of the papers presented here focus on acquiring knowledge rather than deep understanding. If you’re completely unfamiliar with the subject, I recommend starting with textbooks rather than papers. The latest Bishop’s "Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts (2024)" [1] is an excellent resource that covers the "basics" of deep learning and is quite updated. Another good option is Chip Huyen’s "AI Engineering (2024)" [2]. Another excellent choice will be "Dive into Deep Learning" [3], Understanding Deep Learning [4], or just read anything from fast.ai and watch Karpathy's lectures on YouTube.[1]: https://www.bishopbook.com
[2]: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/97810981...
[3]: https://d2l.ai
[4]: https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know what an "AI Engineer" is, but, is reading research papers actually necessary if the half life of the relevancy of many of these papers is only a few months until the next breakthrough happens?I have a feeling, unless you're dabbling at the cutting edge of AI, there's no point in reading research papers. Just get a feel for how these LLMs respond then build a pretty and user friendly app on top of them. Knowing the difference between "multi head attention" and "single head attention" isn't very useful if you're just using OpenAI or Groq's API.Am I missing something here? I'd love to know where I'm wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hi! author here! putting together a list like this is intimidating - for every thing i pick there are a dozen other suitable candidates so please view this as a curriculum with broadly prescriptive weightings, with the understanding that the CURRENTLY_RELEVANT_PAPER is always a moving pointer rather than fixed reference.we went thru this specific reading list in our paper club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIMY9pLPdgif you are interested in a narrative version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42686457</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please stop putting salespeople in charge of highly technical product companies like Sonos. I'm so glad that Tom Conrad is an engineer by training. I hope he can turn this mess around.The key technical change that broke Sonos was abandoning their reliable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) system for device discovery in favor of mDNS, while also shifting from direct device communication to a cloud-based API approach. This new architecture made all network traffic encrypted and routed through Sonos cloud servers (even for local operations), adding significant overhead and latency, especially for older Sonos devices with limited processing power. They also switched from native platform-specific UX frameworks to a JavaScript-based interface while moving music service interactions through their cloud instead of direct SMAPI calls, resulting in slower performance and reduced functionality.For a more extended discussion, see this excellent LinkedIn post from Andy Pennell, a principal engineer at Microsoft with a deep technical understanding of Sonos systems. He created one of the most successful third-party Sonos apps for Windows Phone and worked directly with Sonos on their official Windows Phone 8 app.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-happened-sonos-app-techn...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's less the app, more the business decision to tell people who had spent thousands and thousands of dollars on elaborate sound systems to go throw it all in the trash and start over, all at once.Even Apple has never been that bad. They drop support for things over time but even their roughest transitions (x86, Apple Silicon) have come with extensive day 1 support for previous functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did they switch apps again, or is this still about the debacle when they switched from their original app to the second gen (S2) app many many years ago?Because while that was a shitshow, that's ancient history by now. Did they screw up another generational switch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687932</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Waiting for Oregon" discusses the complexities and challenges surrounding the implementation of Oregon's groundbreaking mental health and addiction treatment laws. It highlights the state's progressive approach to mental health care, focusing on the need for adequate funding, training, and support systems to ensure successful treatment outcomes. The author shares personal insights and raises concerns about the potential pitfalls and the necessity for a comprehensive, cohesive strategy to address mental health issues effectively. Ultimately, the piece advocates for continued vigilance and commitment to improving mental health services in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone fill in the missing link in my understanding here? It seems like the post never gets around to explaining why waiting for 14272 years should make the river passable. (Nor why this river in particular, as opposed to any other obstacle.)The post alludes to a quirk that causes people not to get sicker while waiting; but it says they still get hungry, right? So you can't wait 14272 years there for any purpose unless you have 14272 years' worth of food, right?IIUC, the blogger goes on to patch the game so that you don't get hungry either. But if patching the game is fair play, then what's the point of mentioning the original no-worsening-sickness quirk?It kinda feels like asking "Can you win Oregon Trail by having Gandalf's eagles fly you to Willamette?" and then patching the game so the answer is "yes." Like, what's the reason I should care about that particular initial question? care so badly that I'd accept cheating as an interesting answer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mental image conjured up by this scenario is amusing.  Your impossibly patient party waits almost 15,000 years to cross a river in a state of suspended animation.  Then they finally cross the river and instantly wither away to dust because they had not had a good meal in 15 centuries.Something that was very common with BASIC interpreters but still baffling is how they were running on machines with extremely limited memory and fairly limited CPU time, but for some reason decided not to make integer types available to programmers.  Every number you stored was a massive floating point thing that ate memory like crazy and took forever for the wimpy 8 bit CPU with no FPU to do any work on.  It's like they were going out of their way to make BASIC as slow as possible.  It probably would have been faster and more memory efficient if all numbers were BCD strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You board the Generation Ship Oregon Trail with some trepidation. If the scientists are correct you will be in suspended animation for the next 14272 years. You already feel colder somehow. To the West you see a robotic barkeep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682813</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the practice of mudlarking along the River Thames in London, highlighting the discovery of garnets and other historical artifacts by individuals searching through the muddy banks. It delves into the rich history of the river as a site for finding lost treasures, elaborating on the thrill and context of these findings. The piece also discusses the evolution of mudlarking, the significance of the artifacts in understanding London’s past, and the personal stories of those who engage in this unique hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Only a few people are legally allowed to hunt for Thames garnets—or even remove them if they find them by chance. Mudlarks are among the few who are legally permitted to remove items from the riverbanks. To be a mudlark, you need a license, and in recent years, the British government suspended the issuing of new licenses for several years following a boom in applications during the pandemic lockdowns, leaving the already tight-knit mudlark community in a holding pattern.Well, that's something new I learned today. I wonder why they have to be licensed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my mind, "gems" is pronounced "games", just to mess with foreigners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not these gems but my son and I hunted for and found a couple of 19th century single use pipes and part of a brick with a cool logo a couple of years ago. Go to the Tower Bridge, there are stairs to go to the shore right next to it. Good hunting!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684257</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of suspending and resuming FreeBSD systems, detailing the underlying mechanisms and configuration steps required to effectively use these features. It outlines different methods for suspending a system, including device control commands, and emphasizes the importance of ensuring proper handling of system processes and services during these operations. The author provides practical tips and commands to help users effectively implement suspend/resume functionality while avoiding common pitfalls. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive guide for FreeBSD users looking to manage power states efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP S3 sleep... Took years to get it to work reliably under Linux, then we had a good decade+ run of it "just working" like this, now back to trying to weed out all the wacky platform quirks and weird hardware/firmware behavior that make the S0ix states be just barely unusable.Maybe in another five years...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows used to work about this well back in the XP days, possibly Windows 7 as well. Plenty of times I hit the "sleep" button that Logitech put right next to the esc key (....) and resumed the system to find everything working as expected.Not sure if the embedded video is suspend to RAM or disk. Also not sure why there wasn't a PW prompt upon resume, but I'm not a BSD person, just someone who is paranoid about PW prompts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD and Suspend/Resume… About 10 years ago, I switched from FreeBSD to Linux because I couldn't get suspend/resume to work reliably (i.e. suspend/resume cycle succeeds and it doesn't drain my laptop battery in between) on FreeBSD on my Thinkpad.
And this was only Suspend to RAM. Suspend to Disk is really nice to have, especially if coupled with hybrid standby, as on macOS and Windows by default.I really appreciate that people still maintain FreeBSD on the desktop, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662552</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Northeastern University's recent redesign of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences curriculum, arguing that it moves away from essential computer science fundamentals. The author expresses concern that the new curriculum prioritizes trendy topics over core principles, potentially undermining students' foundational knowledge and problem-solving skills critical for the field. The piece emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between innovative content and traditional computer science education to ensure that graduates are well-equipped for future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to Caltech when they were contemplating similar things in the CS curriculum, although the normal curriculum was less radical than Northeastern's seems to be.There is a tension here that is being understated which is that people of every major now take the intro-level CS class because programming is integral to everything. Teaching algorithm design in that class is not particularly useful to a biologist who just wants to be able to cobble something together to analyze some data (usually in Python). As a result, the non-computer-scientists and non-software-engineers at the school would rather have a curriculum that is more "practical" and directly applies to research (or later class projects) the students might be doing.Some time not far in the future, we are going to accept that this is not the same thing at all as computer science and give the computer scientists a curriculum that is a lot heavier on math and theory while adding elective or core courses for non-major students on programming. That will end the compromised state that intro CS courses currently sit in. Right now, there isn't enough teaching talent to run those non-core courses (because that talent is earning the big bucks doing something else).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The end of an era. This is nothing less than a travesty honestly. The current (now former) curriculum at NEU was uniquely exceptional, and now it will be conformingly adequate. Anyone who complained about the difficulty or lack of "job-market applicability" of the  Fundies classes entirely missed the forest for the trees. The point is the design _process_, and using Racket forced this. It also demonstrated the magic that is possible with computer science. The Dr. Racket editor has features that do not exist in any other editor (e.g. visually tracing references, and so much more). The teaching language just got out of the way and let professors teach the essentials of program design, without the burden of language idiosyncrasies. My mind was honestly blown when Olin Shivers coded the Y combinator directly and showed us how to add recursion to a language. It felt like having occult knowledge, and it made me an acolyte to computer science. I mourn the loss of this curriculum for future students, especially considering the premium price tag they now pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The University that hosted "The Little Schemer" and all its derivatives. Those books were a delight and taught me to think about programming in a way that other languages had not. (Even if I didn't go to that University). 
https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/teaching.htmlI had been to a Scheme conference in Washington, adjunct to the Clojure Conference one year, and it was attended by many undergraduates from Northeastern, (and the authors of those books that I got a photo with.)I have to feel sympathy for those undergraduates I spoke to. They gave a strong feeling, even then (8 years ago), that it was time for the University to move on in language choice.I had a similar experience in the late 90s when the world was picking up Java, and our University insisted on teaching in Eiffel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655283</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misconception that the internet has fundamentally changed human nature for the worse, arguing instead that negative behaviors were already inherent in society before the rise of online connectivity. It reflects on the nostalgia for a more amicable digital environment of the early 2000s while contending that this yearning overlooks the complexities of human interaction and the ways in which online platforms have amplified pre-existing social dynamics. The piece emphasizes the importance of recognizing that both positive and negative aspects of human behavior have always existed, irrespective of the technology used for communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rose-tinted glasses are definitely a thing, as is nostalgia, and before I get into topics like the fact that UI/UX was actually scientifically better[0] back then, I'd like to take a moment to step back and consider what the author is actually implying.Yes, the world was centralised, and profit motives did exist. There was a time where it looked like AOL would legitimately kill the open web, and MSN was trying too at the same time. However; the early 00's were blessed with technological limitation.I distinctly remember the fact that IRC and the primitive forum systems we designed such that an identity tied to a real person was not something people felt the need to have.  To even care what a community thinks because ultimately there's quite literally another one just around the corner.The golden era of community creation was 2002-2004 (incidentally this is when my own IRC network formed). Because heavy handed moderation, power trips and so-on caused market pressures on moderation staff.Too heavy handed and authoritarian: you might kill your community.Not willing to stamp out toxic elements: you might kill your community.That's why we're nostalgic, because simpler times was a combination of:* more focused, human and often better moderation;* a deluge of communities where you could find a place; even if you were weird, like me - and;* an understanding that your identity was not important. "On the internet, nobody know's you're a dog".Yes, there were companies and profit seeking, the web itself was mired in proprietary plugins and jank standards. But there was an ease of hosting communities that is totally lost now.The best many of us can hope for these days, is a little carved out niche as a serf in a fiefdom.[0]: https://ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/courses/ICS104/course-notes/Micro...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was there. I helped build it.It was better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do miss it though.20 years ago you could run your email domain on a machine in your basement and it would work.  You could send out email and it would be received, and the incoming spam volume was manageable.20 years ago, a buddy used an account on my net-connected Linux machine to scrape map tiles off Google Maps.  Google put a stop to it, and Gmaps wouldn't work any more on my (static) IP address.  I told him "you broke it, you fix it" and he got on the horn with someone at Google and got it unblocked.20 years ago, you could go on an online dating site and have a serious hope of finding a real mate for life. I did.  Several others I know did.20 years ago, you could go on Facebook, and see what your friends were up to.Sure, many things didn't exist back then.  But it was a more innocent world.  The internet was still an optimistic place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673596</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really think Matt is suffering from some sort of a mental breakdown. It’s a sad situation and there’s a lot to learn about open source projects with a huge user base and where the bottle necks exist. But I think people who know or are close to him should seriously consider an intervention. I can’t believe after two decades he’d just decide to throw it all out in a blazing fire and tarnish his reputation (and Wordpress) because of some valuation drop or being short on money. I think the dude needs help, and people close to him should try and talk sense into him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy how hosting wordpress, between 2003-2024, your main concern was Chinese/Russian hackers. And in 2025 you main concern should be if Mullenweg will hijack your website for his pissing match.Also he didn't shut down the sustainability team because he "didn't know about it". He shut it down because their stated goals are a threat to Mullenwegs dictatorship hold over wordpress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.This move by Matt to pull out of development all but guarantees a fork. The biggest argument against was the work that Automattic was putting into WordPress would be very hard to replicate in a new project. But if the community is going to be expected to do ~all of the work anyway, there's no reason to do that work inside Matt's personal fiefdom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687121</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this rather odd:&gt; “We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.”If your goal is to extract every possible cent from your existing customers, why would you also switch them from net 30 to requiring partial prepayment?  VMware wants money in general but should not have a cash flow problem, and forcing a monster early payment seems like it will force customers to notice an immediate problem and make a choice instead of allowing themselves to be slowly and steadily ripped off.If I were a pointy-haired CEO committed to the multiply-pricing-by-five strategy, I would do my best to sweeten the deal: offer generous payment terms, give nice-sounding discounts for up front commitments, give very large discounts for nodes that haven’t yet been leased to a customer, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely don't want to miniminize the significance of this.  This is huge!But, they did have some major benefits that most companies looking to do the same won't:&gt; Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform.&gt; The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes.Again, still a great accomplishment and an exciting milestone for them, but for people still stuck on VMWare that are looking to migrate, it's good to know about the above things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phrase "homebrew KVM platform" made me chuckle. All of the hyperscalers have a homebrew, aka proprietary platform using a hypervisor.  AWS has Nitro which seems to have been based on KVM but likely quite different by now.If you are selling VMs to customers, I can't understand a good reason to use VMWare.  The only reason would be if you are selling VMWare as a service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682671</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;User defined functions were implemented similarly as external execs in early shells. As the script was parsed, functions were dropped into /tmp without their wrappings and then called as external programs.  Since they would still reference parameters as $1, $2 etc, it just worked: function bodies and standalone sh scripts had the same interface! Such a clever idea to avoid managing an interpreted call stack in the parent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked C source file is an excellent example of ancient C, when it was still more closer to high level assembly:https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V2/cmd/glob.c&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; PS: I don't know why expanding shell wildcards used a separate program in V6 and earlier, but part of it may have been to keep the shell smaller and more minimal so that it required less memory.See, I thought it was a nice separation of concerns and wondered why we lost such a nice approach, until I read:&gt; How escaping wildcards works in the V5 and V6 shell is that all characters in commands and arguments are restricted to being seven-bit ASCII. The shell and /etc/glob both use the 8th bit to mark quoted characters, which means that such quoted characters don't match their unquoted versions and won't be seen as wildcards by either the shellat which point I suddenly became a fan of ditching it. I do wonder if there's not some better way to factor that functionality out...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680437</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been my experience. Foundation models have completely changed the game of ML. Previously, companies might have needed to hire ML engineers familiar with ML training, architectures etc to get mediocre results. Now companies can just hire a regular software engineer familiar with foundation model API’s to get excellent results. In some ways it is sad, but in other ways the result you get is so much better than we achieved before.My example was an image segmentation model. I managed to create an dataset of 100,000+ images and was training UNets and other advanced models on it, always reached a good validation loss but my data was simply not diverse enough and I faced a lot of issues in actual deployment, where the data distribution kept changing on a day to day basis. Then, I tried DINO v2 from Meta, finetuned on 4 images and it solved the problem, handled all the variations in lighting etc with far higher accuracy than I ever achieved. It makes sense, DINO was train on 100M + images, I would never be able to compete with that.In this case, the company still needed my expertise, because Meta just released the weights and so someone had to setup the fine-tuning pipeline. But I can imagine a fine tuning API like OpenAI’s requiring no expertise outside of simple coding. If AI results depend on scale, it naturally follows that only a few well funded companies, will build AI that actually works, and everyone else will just use their models. The only way this trend reverses, is if compute becomes so cheap and ubiquitous, that everyone can achieve the necessary scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's tough to judge without seeing examples of the targets and the user photos, but I'm curious if this could be done with just old-school SIFT. If it really is exactly the same image in the in the corpus and on the wall, does a neural embedding model really buy you a lot? A small number of high confidence tie points  seems like it'd be all you need, but it probably depends a lot on just how challenging the user photos are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This tracks with my experience.
We built a complex processing pipeline for an NLP classification, search and comprehension task. Using vector database of Proprietary data etc.We ran a benchmark of our system against an LLM call and the LLM performed much better for so much cheaper, in terms of dev time, complexity, and compute.
Incredible time to be in working in the space seeing traditional problems eaten away by new paradigms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660184</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in the American food industry, tracing its origins back to the 1970s when it became a cheaper alternative to sugar due to government corn subsidies. It explores the health implications of HFCS consumption, its role in the obesity epidemic, and how food manufacturers adopted it widely because of its sweetness and preservative qualities. The piece also highlights the backlash against HFCS and the growing demand for natural sugars, reflecting on the complexities of food production and consumer choices in America.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corn Syrup and Sucrose are chemically identical from the standpoint of human metabolism, especially in solution where sucrose will have already disassociated. The only difference is that the ratio of fructose:sucrose is slightly (~5%) higher in corn syrup.I've always been dismayed at the misdirected fury around corn syrup as if it is somehow worse than any other sugar.If you want to go down the rabbit hole, try to find an actual proper double blind academic study that demonstrates a taste difference between sucrose and high fructose corn syrup. I'll be here waiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently watched an interesting video on the subject of corn syrup. Which led me into the fascinating rabbit hole of sugar chemistry.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY66qpMFOYoIf I might summarize.Your body can absorb three types of sugar into the blood, glucose, fructose and galactose. glucose is directly used by cells, the other two have to take a trip through the liver to turn them into glucose.Table sugar is sucrose. a complex sugar. which can be best thought of as a fructose and a glucose linked together.Corn syrup is a mixture of ~ 45% glucose 55% fructoseSucrose is quickly broken apart into glucose and fructose in several environments, high heat will do it, but also acidic environments. like your stomach, or a soda. a soda will be slightly acidic due to the carbon dioxide dissolved in it(carbonic acid). And some formulations(like coke) add additional phosphoric acid.And to spoil the video. Even if you put sucrose into a soda, that is not what you are going to be drinking. I was unable to figure out why it tastes different, are the ratios off? additional trace chemicals in one source?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Americans are paying their food higher than they should because industrials are paying more for sugar because lobbyist paid money to politicians to get them to put tariff on sugar import.So, basically American's money is going in the pocket of big corporation thanks to corrupt politicians.And it's still going on to these days, no government has yet removed these tariffs.Isn't tariff what started the American revolution ? Things changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687133</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone wonder why conversation graphs look this way in Disco Elysium is because it's build using middleware called Articy:draft. Graphs is how Articy editor designed so it's only natural to visalize it this way.Since my team also made a story driven game using Articy that far less complex than Disco Elysium, but still complex. After we done it I can say for sure that whoever written Disco Elysium is trully insane, in a good way. While Articy is a good tool it's have own set of problems specifically awful performance on huge projects and I can't even imagine how developers of Disco Elysium managed to accompish it.So I pretty sure Disco Elysium isn't just masterpiece of storytelling and writing, but also insane technical achievement of whoever managed to get it all working together using tools they had. Even on a project of much smaller scale getting it all debugged, loop-free and free of tons of logical errors is very hard. Knowing how much variables Disco Elysium have I truly believe developers are all geniuses.PS: It's just everyone always wonder at how cool and complex modern rendering is or performance in game with millions of objects, but very few people understand how hard is to create story-driven game if there is more than 10 variables and not just int skill checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is something more supposed to show up?

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive map of the London Underground system, showcasing various tube lines, stations, and key transit information. Users can explore different tube routes, view station details, and access real-time updates on train services.

For example, it doesn't even mention the map. Instead, it invokes trademark registration numbers but these resolve [2] to LONDON UNDERGROUND and UNDERGROUND wordmarks and the roundel, none of them covering the map geometry as far as I can tell. It alleges a violation under Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act [3] but the act only applies to domains - and TfL never claims "traintimes" to be an infringing domain name (certainly doesn't look so under the marks cited). And, as a sibling comment points out, the act is a U.S. law but the site appears to be hosted in the U.K.If you think you have a case about the map, why not state it explicitly? The cynical answer is that ISPs have incentives not to care so making a case doesn't matter but ...[1] https://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/email2.txt

[3] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t see the issue. You were using the TfL schematic map which is very much a form of art. I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they asked you to take that specific map down or continue with a license.To remove the whole site because of that seems petty.It was clearly stated in their api documentation. It’s no
different than getting a license or usage rights for hosting an image or video on your site. Just because you are a hobbyist doesn’t mean you don’t have to follow the rules.This is coming from someone who is extremely pro fair-use and right to ownership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This licensing page appears to be a new addition to TfL, which probably suggests some bureaucrat negotiated a deal with a creative agency to license the tube map for pennies on the dollar, resulting in them sending out these notices.https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/business-and-advertisers/map-lic...Amusingly the notice was sent with references to USA trademark law.I am not sure how it works with regional governments, but copyright information for government-produced works tends to live as a "crown copyright" in the UK and former colonies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682876</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the harrowing experience of a luxury passenger train that became trapped for three days during a deadly winter storm near Donner Pass in 1952. The train, named the "City of San Francisco," was stuck in deep snow, leaving passengers stranded without sufficient supplies or heat. The piece details the efforts of the train crew and rescuers to keep everyone safe and fed while highlighting the brutal conditions they faced. Ultimately, the story illustrates both the challenges of winter travel in the Sierra Nevada and the resilience of the stranded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “In the 1950s, you had this mid-century hubris—technology could conquer all,” says Ty Smith, director of the California State Railroad Museum. “Part of the reason this episode happened was this unyielding optimism that we could solve every problem. In the face of a blizzard in the Sierra, that just wasn’t true.”My takeaway was the opposite. A hundred years before this, a different group was stuck in the same pass, and couldn't get help for 4 months. This situation resolved in 3 days, and there was no cannibalism. When something similar happened to an Amtrak in 2019, it only took a day and a half, and people still had access to Twitter the entire time. Not to diminish the suffering, etc., etc., but it seems like there's cause for optimism when it comes to technological progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The City was among America’s premier trains, a luxury streamliner that could hit 110 miles per hour while white-jacketed waiters balanced trays of cocktailsI wonder how passengers back then would have imagined rail travel today, 75 years later (aside from the life-threatening storms, of course). The Overland Route is now freight-only, and the closest equivalent, the California Zephyr, takes about 52 hours to make the journey this train did in just 40!More on topic, I was surprised to read:&gt; When the steam generators’ water tanks ran dry, heat disappeared, too.Weren't there surrounded by frozen water? Is there any reason snow couldn't be used in an emergency to heat the train?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I've driven Route 50 between Tahoe and Placerville a few times. Many of these times the weather has been quite bad. Many of these times I've had to wait for hours while an accident was cleared, or 12 foot snow drifts were plowed.When I'm traveling in mountain snow, I'm always very neurotic about prep. AWD or 4x4, water, chains, food, emergency kits, etc ... I always assume I could be stuck for 24 hours or more.In the meantime, I am constantly shocked by how many people make this trek with little or no respect for how deadly snow can be. The worst of it is when it puts others in danger: I'll never forget seeing a front-wheel drive sedan repeatedly driving up, then slipping back on a steep hill, while a line of 20 cars waited behind it.Part of it is just not knowing (I grew up in the east coast), but part of it is just human nature to not understand some things to be inherently dangerous. Snow and cold looks so serene, but cold in it's various forms has killed many more people than heat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657593</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper basically reinforces one of the tenets of transit noise and vibration analyses: if you don't maintain your system (specifically wheels and rails in the case of noise), things tend to get louder over time. BCRTC knows this [0] and they're working on it. As with all things, it's about time and money, but they are trying to be proactive with vehicle and track maintenance via rail grinding and complaint tracking.[0] https://archive.wheel-rail-seminars.com/archives/2022/rt-pap...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rail grinding noise of those Mark 1 Skytrain cars are really something. They literally made my ears hurt. For reference New York's subway rail noise never made my ears hurt that much.The explanation I read online is that Translink (the transport authority) lost one of the 2 rail grinders they contracted, and had to buy a grinder for use. So for a few years, while waiting for the grinder to arrive, the rails were not getting the regular grinding needed that'd lessen the wheels-on-rail noise.An unverified rumor I heard was that Translink cheaped out and bought a batch of substandard rails that are softer than needed. This means the rails wear out and become out of spec faster. The issue was compounded by the fact that the softer rails were used to replace a large portions of routes with sharp curves.The rolling stocks use linear induction propulsion, which means there is no electric motor on the train. The trains are very light as a result and require different maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And then you have Montreal with their very quiet rubber wheeled metro system. https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/student-contributors-techn...The problem with the Vancouver system is the combination of it being above ground and noisy. Ideally, you want to build density directly beside the tracks. That said, I lived near the tracks for a few years and although we could hear it, it wasn't that bad. We were fairly high up and had good windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681762</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Siren Song of Little Languages" discusses the appeal and value of lesser-known programming languages in the tech community. It explores the reasons developers might be drawn to these languages, such as their simplicity, unique features, or niche applications. The author reflects on the benefits and drawbacks of using little languages in software development, emphasizing the importance of understanding the trade-offs involved. Ultimately, the piece encourages developers to appreciate the diversity of programming languages while critically assessing their practicality for real-world uses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My take is that, for productive work, language is much less important than everything around it. I need at the very least some kind of package management and dependency resolution system. Sometimes I want to read a CSV file, turn some of the content into JSON and serve it over HTTP. In an environment with sensible libraries, that's just a case of glueing stuff together. The problem is not little languages, it's little ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author seems to miss that many people don't write their lisp (or their game, or their code-golfing one-liner, or their befunge program) for it to be used, they write it because they enjoy writing a lisp.As for those who believe their language of choice can actually become mainstream, it's a long, soul-crushing and miserable road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The problem seems to be languages with a small, well written specification.that’s why I’m making my language as big and poorly specified as possible:https://hyperscript.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655544</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "comptime" or compile time as a form of configuration in programming. It explores how using compile-time techniques can lead to more efficient and safer code by allowing certain operations and configurations to be determined before runtime. The author presents examples highlighting the benefits of comptime, such as improved performance and compile-time error detection, as well as its applications in various programming languages. The piece encourages developers to consider comptime as a valuable tool for enhancing their code's configurability and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun story, while at FAANG I was once tasked with making a parameter configurable via flag. This wasn't super easy for various reasons, but I pointed out that it was configurable already: all you had to do was submit a PR to change the hardcoded value in the code and it would update everywhere and that wasn't much different from how we already configured runtime parameters by submitting a PR that updated the config file.I got a good chuckle out of my coworkers but as I've gotten more experienced there's a grain of truth in that. Actually the main non-joking objection was that deployments are slow so if we needed to, reconfiguring runtime flags was a good amount faster. But that made me think: if deployments and builds are super fast, would we still need configuration in the conventional yaml and friends sense? It could save a lot of foot guns from misconfiguration and practically speaking, we essentially never restarted the server to reconfigure it. From the article,&gt; Unless you have really good reason to, you probably should not do this for normal options - it makes your library much more rigid by requiring that the user of your library know the options at comptime.I dunno, actually that sounds really great to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652730</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat, Submitted a request for my grandfather's records. Some comments:1) May want to auto-magically handle input for things like apostrophes. E.g. "O'Hare"... It looks like somewhere in the process this data was not preserved/saved/sent, but people will probably try to search with it. Might also want to handle the accent marks and what not too2) The terms &amp; conditions for Step 3, the checkbox at the bottom doesn't have enough contrast when checked. I do not have a disability, and I still found it very faint. Someone with a disability would likely have a lot of trouble (not to mention, it requires scrolling to the bottom to check it in the first place, which isn't awesome for accessibility)3) I appreciate the warning on the terms and conditions about seeing things you might not want to see. A good reminder for those that might not want to tarnish a memory of someone... Reminds me of the DNA tests for Christmas, or learning about Punnett Squares and genetics, sometimes you might not want to go looking :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I previously tried getting military records for my deceased grandfather. From what I can recall, it was complicated by the fact that I wasn't "next of kin", which would limit the data I'd have access to. Even my parent, who was next of kin, would have needed additional paperwork as proof, e.g. a death/marriage certificate for my grandmother.On one hand, if this works then I'll be happy to have the information I otherwise wouldn't have. But on the other hand, all these processes, no matter how convoluted, exist for a reason. It feels weird bypassing those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you aware that the API appears to be publishing the SSN of each individual? Although I’m aware most SSNs are leaked in one breach or another, I still thought it was customary in the U.S. to attempt to keep such information somewhat protected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of literate programming, which emphasizes writing code that is easily readable and understandable by humans in addition to being executable by machines. It highlights the importance of documenting the thought process behind the code and integrating narrative and code together. The author argues that this approach fosters better understanding and communication among programmers while also serving as a self-documenting method. The post includes insights into tools and techniques that facilitate literate programming, promoting a shift in how coding can be approached to enhance clarity and collaboration in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683009"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are at least two aspects to literate programming.Knuth wrote TeX in Pascal, which has a couple of limitations that annoyed him:- Pascal has no module system: you can’t break a program up into multiple files- The order of presentation of a program is dictated by the needs of a single-pass compilerThe tooling that supports literate programming is mostly about overcoming these problems with Pascal. (Knuth also uses it to split up larger procedures in a manner that makes me think of very un-structured C macros.) Most other languages are more flexible so they have much less need for a technology like tangle/weave.The opposite extreme is Literate Haskell, which doesn’t need any preprocessor. You just feed your TeX document to ghc and it picks the code out of the \begin{code} blocks. Or instead of Knuth style you can write in Bird style, where the file is a plain text document with code marked by &gt; quote blocks.The other aspect of literate programming is organizing the code like a book. This is very difficult to do well. When I think of how I approach a codebase, it reminds me of textbooks that have a complicated diagram describing multiple suggested orders of reading (a chapter per module?), or the informal introduction to Algol 68 with its orthogonal table of contents. Ideally a program’s commentary should span both the explanatory and reference documentation quadrants.What strikes me about Knuth’s literate programming is how hypertextual it is, albeit using printed cross-references and indexes. It seems to be in desperate need of interactive pixels. And an underlying programming language that has better support for Knuth’s preferred size of code fragment.On balance I think modern tools achieve Knuth’s goals better than tangle/weave. Modern languages let you organize code much closer to its narrative structure, without WEB’s unhygienic scoping. Editors and IDEs and documentation browsers give you hyperlinks everywhere.It’s then “just” a matter of writing the exposition. Less literate programming, more literate programmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent a lot of time thinking about no/low code and one conclusion I came to was that there was "the program" and then there was the way it displayed.  Considerhttps://www.knime.com/why-visual-workflowsthe topology of the connection between the blocks is essential to execute the program;  that doesn't require coordinates for the blocks,  but the visual editor does.  The ideal tool has a clean separation between these.  People are dimly aware of the "hairball" graph problem and looking for a visualization algorithm that banishes them:https://blog.tomsawyer.com/untangle-the-hairball-with-bundle...yet the real problem is that if your goal is to communicate you want to tell stories with visualizations and you need a visualization organized around a story -- and for each story you tell you need a different visualization.I see the same thing with literate software.  I can think of a number of interesting stories to tell about last month's chess program (e.g. "move generation",  "alpha-beta search",  for instance.)  For a particular story I want to focus on certain things and completely eliminate other things.  The same code might appear in more than one story.  To make all this work there has to be a clean separation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with literate programming is that most people aren’t good writers, and they aren’t interested in developing their writing skills - they only want to code.Already it’s pulling teeth just to get literate commit messages…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683009</guid></item><item><title>37.

Our motivation for developing CopperSpice was to change the core design of the libraries leveraging modern C++ functionality.&gt; The redesign allowed us to completely remove the Meta-Object Compiler (moc) system. Moc is a code generator and did not support many aspects of modern C++ including templates, complex data types, static type checking, and relied heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc improves run time performance, reduces the complexity of the build process, and allows more issues to be detected at compile time.This sounds pretty great. Does anyone have experience using it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any reason to not upstream the refactorings?The default theme doesn't look that great on mobile. At least one can change the side menu size.The challenges I'm facing with doxygen is to create a seamless integration with a MkDocs site, but not just for a single version. The current workaround of manually copying the generated MkDocs header and footer isn't very automated...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Supports C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, (Corba and Microsoft) IDL, Objective-C, Python, PHP, TCLWondering how Python support stacks up against Sphinx.

This is not good for a "young person".  They need to get there quicker IMHO.I always say that the reason I got into programming (at the age of 10) was because of the BBC Micro User Guide [1].* Page 5: first code written (and importantly, code that has a visual component)* Page 6: Drawing lines* Page 7: Playing soundsetc.I realised very quickly that I was able to make a game.  And that was it, I was hooked for life.The Raspberry Pi took its inspiration from the BBC Micro (Model B).  It's a shame that there wasn't more of a push to make it as easy as the original Model B to get going and start programming.(Of course I realise that it's running Linux where nothing is simple, but yeah, I'm not sure it necessarily helps kickstart the next generation in the way the original BBC Micro did)[1] https://archive.org/details/BBCUG/mode/2up?view=theater&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To install the BCPL System on the Raspberry Pi you must first ob-
tain a copy of the file bcpl.tgz [...]Version numbers, what are those ...When you have some problem with bcpl.gz, just send an e-mail. Be sure to mention the approximate date when you obtained bcpl.gz. Like was it closer to Halloween last year, or more toward Thanksgiving or Christmas? Be sure to download bcpl.tgz daily, until the problem goes away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice introduction text with detailed description to set-up a R.Pi and interesting examples (AES, calculating Euler's number, Rubik's cube etc.).  Shame it uses an utterly obsolete language of which most interesting feature (byte code interpreter making porting the compiler to new architectures comparatively easy) was important in the seventies with its plethora of architectures (many short-lives), but hardly today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673435</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the evolution of skyscraper architecture, focusing on the trend of utilizing glass as the primary material in modern towers. It discusses factors contributing to this phenomenon, including advancements in technology, the quest for natural light, and the desire for aesthetic appeal. The emphasis on transparency and the minimalist design of glass facades reflect both functional and cultural shifts in urban environments, highlighting how these structures symbolize modernity and progress while addressing energy efficiency and sustainability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two lines that summarize the article for me:&gt; Why developers chose glass curtain walls -
So why did developers embrace the glass box aesthetic? Unsurprisingly, it comes down to economics.&gt; Ornamentation and glass curtain wall aren’t mutually exclusive.And while I agree that ornamentation is very likely lost to cost savings, the switch to glass walls is also just a huge improvement for people inside the building.Having worked in an all-glass tower and also a "normal" office building, my personal experience is that the natural light that giant windows let in and the external views that they afford are both phenomenal improvements to the atmosphere. It's really a much more pleasant environment to work in. The only catch is that the interior or window treatment design needs to consider glare from sunlight directly hitting computer screens and/or eyes.So, sure, maybe something something costs, but people also pay attention to environmental ergonomics now in ways that they never used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Air conditioning was becoming common, making it possible to cool buildings with large expanses of windows that might otherwise get too hot in the summer.I guess the cost of having to install and run AC is dwarfed by the savings in construction costs?Or is this a case of operational costs being ignored in favor of capital costs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always thought large buildings have more windows because the inner spaces would otherwise get 0 natural light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683736</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've been using Taskfile, which is fantastic and super understandable, but it's only a task-runner and as such wouldn't meet OP's needs. I hated `just` and did not find it at all intuitive.Only problem I have with the article is saying that Ruby doesn't work on Windows is just categorically false. It's one of the easiest languages to install and use on Windows, even easier than C# and Java, and I'm a Java/Kotlin dev, so that's saying something. It's literally just a single exe/msi installer.But you wouldn't want to be using Rake anyway, it's not really that good, and is only useful if you're working in an environment where you don't want to install anything and you hate Make. Then Ruby is very often installed by default with Rake and so you get a 'free' build tool. Rake was good 10 years ago, but not so much anymore.Anyway, if you needed a specific kind of tool and built it then all the power to you. Can't blame you for not wanting to use the other options!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish you success with this! I really was surprised to see that there isn’t a modern make replacement that actually does what make does, and does it well: build /compile things with a notion of inputs and outputs and out-of-date checks. Most appear to be “just” command runners. That’s a very useful thing to have, but it’s not really a make replacement.
Then again, many “build tools” do get very large and unwieldy eventually, so maybe it’s more a case of the good make replacements simply getting too much traction…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why a new language?In my opinion, Starlark (in rust, Apache 2: &lt;https://github.com/facebook/starlark-rust/blob/v0.13.0/LICEN...&gt;) is the way since it is designed for sandboxed environments and also (AIUI) was initially designed to support Bazel, a build toolNow, I'm totally on board that people can hate on whitespace sensitive languages, but if my choice was "make my own language that no one has ever heard of" or "delete the Python hater's emails" ...It also would mean that you could tag your Werkfile in .gitattributes with linguist annotations[1] and they'd syntax highlight, which isn't the case with your own language https://github.com/simonask/werk/blob/5990c8a9536a1a76c3da59...1: https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/v9.0.0/docs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672863</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The Qubes OS Templates page provides an overview of the various template systems used in Qubes OS, a security-focused operating system that employs virtualization to isolate applications. It explains the purpose of templates, which allow for the creation of AppVMs (application virtual machines) while sharing a common base, thus saving resources and improving security. The page outlines the different types of templates available, such as Fedora, Debian, and Whonix, along with instructions on how to use and manage them effectively to enhance system functionality and security. Additionally, it includes guidance on template customization and best practices for maintaining a secure environment within Qubes OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities associated with parallel programming, highlighting the need for efficient methodologies to leverage multi-core architectures. It discusses various parallel programming models, their respective strengths and weaknesses, and emphasizes the importance of developing user-friendly tools and frameworks to reduce the complexity of parallel programming. The author advocates for a collaborative approach in the development of hardware and software solutions to optimize performance and enhance the usability of parallel systems, ultimately aiming to make parallel programming more accessible to a wider range of developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York has begun enforcing a new broadband law aimed at enhancing accessibility and affordability of internet service, despite significant opposition from internet service providers (ISPs) who attempted to block its implementation. The law mandates that ISPs offer plans for $15 per month to low-income households, with the goal of increasing connectivity for underserved communities. The article discusses the background of the legislation, the resistance from ISPs, and the potential impact on consumers and the broadband market in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The New York law requiring Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes will take effect on Wednesday this week following a multi-year court battle in which the state defeated broadband industry lobby groups.I don't like these types of mandates because it distorts the market. Politicians get to say "we provided X people with internet service and we didn't use a dollar of tax payers' money". Which sounds nice, but you can't really get something for nothing. This will increase costs for ISPs and likely increase prices for others. How much? Who knows!If politicians feel that low income New Yorkers deserve reduced cost or free internet, give them a voucher for internet. Better yet, figure out how much of a voucher they would need and give them a check. Let them decide whether they want to buy internet, or better food or housing or whatever else. Or if you go the voucher router, giving them options lets ISPs compete for this. Don't think taxpayers should pay? Make a special ISP tax and give it to these people to make it budget neutral.Not to mention the red tape and abuse this will create. I really don't want me ISP to track my income.What they decided on is the worst possible option as it results in hidden costs and bad incentives. The only people its good for (compared to the alternatives), is politicians who can by dictate just seemingly create free things for people for no cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Price increases are to be capped at 2 percent per year, and state officials will periodically review whether minimum required speeds should be raised.2% is below current inflation rates, so this could potentially go haywire super easily.New York has been here before; the subway was fixed to a nickel for four decades, which ended up bankrupting the private subway companies and set the stage for the underfunded, deferred maintenance of future decades, which New York is still working through the backlog for nearly a hundred years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I agree that people getting internet in this day and age is _basically_ a necessity (and thus the govt should interfere when needed to make that happen), doing it in this way is the worse possible implementation. Was it necessary in this case? I don't know.First, foster competition. I don't know the NY landscape, but in the West Coast, it's not uncommon for a residency to have effectively a single option for ISP. Ensure consumers have options (incentivize creation of new ISPs? Stop allowing big corporations to buy small ones? break up big corporations and force them to compete?)Second could the government offer public internet? (ie, be a player in the market).Only as a last resort should these types of heavy hand price enforcements should be taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687861</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dislike RTO for one simple reason .I'm not at work to make friends, I'm not at work to chit chat. I'm not at work so we can talk about who won the last football game .I go to work in exchange for currency, which is required to acquire goods and services. All this other crap, all these holiday parties, all of this let's dance in diversity videos, no that's not what I'm here for .Most of the time coming to the office actually adds a bunch of unnecessary crap that is completely unneeded. If you can't get your job done remotely, what's the stop you from also slacking off in the office. I have to go back to the office for a while last year times were hard and I didn't have another option .We're just talking to each other, shooting the s**, and it was cool to meet some Junior Devs who were just starting their career. But none of that made me a more productive worker.If I had to think, I imagine the entire point of RTO mandates is to keep cities sustainable.If every single office job went remote, what's the point of a city like New York. Who's going to willingly pay $6,000 for an apartment, ride the trains for over an hour a day, if you can just sit at home in a much cheaper city .However, to quote a famous philosopher, it's a big club and you ain't in it. The powers that be one as many people in office chairs as possible, so they're real estate holdings appreciate in value.Billy Bob's bagels also benefits from this, although I'd imagine he's not able to have the same amount of pool as the real estate titans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think RTO mandates will be the straw that broke the camel's back, for a lot of Americans. Workers in sectors that previously wouldn't even think about unionizing, are now having serious discussions.Going back to commutes, wasting time, for no obvious reason - yeah, that did wake up people.EDIT: I'm talking about rigid 5 days a week RTO policy. As other have pointed out, having a flexible WFH policy is often "good enough" for most people. Not all want 100% WFH, but taking away the flexibility of WFH a couple of days a week, if you want, feels like a shitty deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I generally think for many jobs, in-person is actually better.SWE in a place with good process, remote is probably fine. Generally similar for jobs with clear deliverables on that kind of time scale. if it's more research oriented, there is a huge benefit to being in-person in front of a whiteboard. For a job with shifting requirements day to day (like some legal or banking work), it is easier to coordinate everyone in the same office.unclear if this overcomes cost to employees of the commute, housing, etc., but the value is there.however there is also "worst of all possible worlds" RTO, where you have to commute to the office because the office is the place you are required to sit for your 4+ hours of Zoom calls per day with other colleagues in other offices. I expect a lot of companies are going to do this, which is totally stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688159</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the high failure rate of startup businesses, highlighting that many do not survive their first year. It identifies common reasons for these failures, such as inadequate market research, lack of funding, and poor management. To mitigate these risks, the article offers survival tips for entrepreneurs, which include understanding the target market, creating a solid business plan, maintaining sufficient cash flow, and being adaptable to changes. Ultimately, the piece aims to equip new business owners with strategies to increase their chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;on year 7 of my startup and profitable. I'd like to add a few things.1. look for a boring problem that needs solving. related to the product market fit. a lot of founders are trying to build a sexy solution to a problem that no one has.2. Sales is half the equation!. you can have the best engineering team in the world but it means nothing if you dont have good sales. and good sales people don't just get sales. they are the first point of contact for your prospective customers. Empower them to get feedback and ideas for how to evolve your product. half of our features at my startup are things we never would have thought of until our sales guys kept telling us how many restaurants were requesting the feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, I got it. If I want to make a successful startup, I simply just need to get an insane amount of funding and develop a great product based on detailed market research that fits the market and solves an actual problem. I also should find a way to actually sell a product in order to avoid negative cash flow problems.This reminds me a bit of the main reason why restaurant businesses fail according to some TV shows I've watched: They have a lousy cook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article must be pretty great to make it to the front page while messing about with how scrolling works:-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660424</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon known as "Havana Syndrome," characterized by mysterious health issues reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers, primarily in Cuba and later in other countries. It delves into the theories surrounding its cause, including potential foreign attacks using advanced technology, with a particular focus on Russia's possible involvement. The piece examines the government’s response, the ongoing investigations, and the implications for U.S.-Russia relations, while highlighting the challenges faced in conclusively identifying the syndrome's origins and the broader impact on personnel safety in diplomatic missions.&lt;/p&gt;

We already know directed-energy weapons are possible [0], what are the challenges in exploring the space until you're able to build an approximate match for what people report having experienced?The most scary thing about these kinds of systems seems to me to be the potential for urban terrorism. If it doesn't leave any trace and it can penetrate walls, it could be used to attack people working for rival organizations as well as general harassment. Imagine a tool that lets you disrupt someone's sleep, using that over months would be enough to drive them insane or at least seriously hamper their productivity and performance. For example: if a rival sports team is visiting and you're able to disrupt their sleep that might be enough to give your team an edge.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential banning of the game "Luck Be a Landlord" from Google Play due to concerns related to its gambling themes and mechanics. It explores the implications of such a ban on the game's accessibility and the broader impact on similar games within the digital marketplace. The piece highlights community reactions, developer responses, and the ongoing conversation about gambling regulations in mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;LBAL and Balatro being banned or 18+ age-gated for having gambling "vibes" despite not actually simulating gambling, while the stores are full of gacha games which are designed to bleed players dry through real-money gambling mechanics is a ridiculous state of affairs. The latter makes Google and Apple insane amounts of money though so of course they're not going to do anything about them unless their hand is forced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a “finished” game or app on google play has never worked well for me. 
There is constant nag to update it for a variety of reasons. Even if the nag comes from device related sdk updates (just recompiles), a reupload requires you to comply with latest policies that often seem very subjective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be fair, if you were to design a game meant to create false positives for gambling, it would probably be a game just like this.While a sympathize with the dev, this is a bit like carrying around a replica gun in public and complaining that you constantly have to ward off police reports.Parents are gonna see the slots and file reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683567</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that so few people blog these days makes blogging even more influential than it used to be.You can establish yourself as something of a global expert on some topic just by writing about it a few times a month over the course of a year!Don't expect people to come to your blog. Practice https://indieweb.org/POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere - post things on your blog and then tweet/toot/linkedin/submit-to-hacker-news/share-in-discord etc.Also, don't worry too much about whether you get traffic at the time you write something. A lot of the reputational value comes from having written something that you can link people to in the future. "Here are my notes about that topic from last year: LINK" - that kind of thing.There's a lot to be said for writing for its own sake, too. Just writing about a topic forces you to double-check your understanding and do a little bit more research. It's a fantastic way of learning more about the world even if nobody else ever reads it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define "worth it", but I've written a blog post about some printer driver issue two years ago and it now happened twice that someone (Older person, not very technical) reached out over email and asked for some further help and I could walk them step by step through using a Terminal, booting into macOS recovery mode and fixing the issue.The Apple store and Epson told them to do a clean install so they were very grateful and it made me happy that I could help them. Worth it for me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write for myself. I don't track, I don't care if people read my blog.I do mention my blog on my resume together with code repositories. It is some kind of portfolio, and it is a good learning experience for me.I don't think that it is worth "building a brand", unless you want to specialize in building brands. It's not like someone at Google will ever read your blog and offer you a job; if you want to work at Google, learn how to pass their interview process. If you want to be visible on social media, probably you need to follow a ton of people, engage with them, produce a lot of content and the kind of content that people like or repost. This has nothing to do with a personal blog, though.Another thing is that if you find it worth blogging about, it's probably niche in the first place. If it's common knowledge, it's probably already on Wikipedia, or StackOverflow, or now some LLM (and if you wait long enough, your blog will be part of the LLM, whether you want it or not).I see it like FOSS: if you do it with the hope that many people will use it, then I think it's a bad idea. Because you work for free and people will never be happy. If you do it for yourself, it's great!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42685534</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Godot uses their own engine features for the GUI of the editor itself as you’d use to make a game itself with.https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/list_of_feature...&gt; Godot's GUI is built using the same Control nodes used to make games in Godot. The editor UI can easily be extended in many ways using add-ons.And they even go as far as to explicitly say the following:&gt; Godot's small distribution size can make it a suitable alternative to frameworks like Electron or Qt.I’ve only used Godot for game development, not GUI stuff yet. (The game I started making doesn’t have any menus, I’m working on gameplay and level design first.) But I’m personally keeping a mental note in the back of my mind to investigate building bona fide desktop applications with Godot also, and not just games.Also, if you’re going to make an application instead of a game, they have a special mode they recommend that you use:&gt; When creating a non-game application, make sure to enable low-processor mode in the Project Settings to decrease CPU and GPU usage.https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/faq.html#is-it-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For truly novel UIs with high dynamism it is probably a good decision.For anything else it is almost certainly more work for the dev and more resource-intensive for the system.One thing I haven't seen anyone else mention is that a game engine is generally going to be re-rendering constantly, as part of the game/render loop. This is because in a game it is almost always the case that something is changing on screen at any given moment.In a more "normal" app UI, most things are static, so having a render loop operate like that doesn't make much sense. So instead things are optimized for the static case – if nothing is happening on screen, resources are not being used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It really depends on your App and probably the game engine.There's a reason why a lot of people use Electron for apps and it's because the amount of effort it takes to write HTML / JS and have a functional UI is very little.It seems like you like the idea in order to implement a novel UI and I suspect then yes a game engine is a good idea. However, do consider the UX of your app. Excel is a spreadsheet because that is pretty much the best way to display tabular data. So if the novel UI isn't a better UX than an existing way you probably don't want to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672339</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a malicious npm package by Snyk, which was designed to target web applications by stealing sensitive data such as environment variables and API keys. It highlights how the package was able to evade detection by using obfuscation techniques and discusses the broader implications of such threats in the JavaScript ecosystem. The piece emphasizes the importance of security practices in software development and the need for continuous monitoring of dependencies to safeguard against vulnerabilities and malicious software.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;[EDIT: See the response by a Cursor dev below — looks like it was not authorized by them]Sounds to me like Cursor internally has a private NPM registry with those packages. Because of how NPM works, it's quite easy to trick it to fetch the packages from the public registry instead, which could be used by an attacker [0].Assumably, this Snyk employee either found or suspected that some part of Cursor's build is misconfigured as above, and uploaded those packages as a POC. (Given the package description "for Cursor", I'd think they were hired for this purpose.)If that's the case, then there's not much to see here. The security researcher couldn't have used a private NPM registry to perform the POC if the point is to demonstrate a misconfiguration which skips the private registry..[0] In particular, many proxies will choose the public over the private registry if the latest package version is higher: https://snyk.io/blog/detect-prevent-dependency-confusion-att...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also interestingly the Snyk cofounder has started a competitor to cursor 
https://www.tessl.io/ https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/tessl-raises-125m-at-at-50...I hope there is no foul play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only part of the article I disagree with is this line:&gt; But in general, it’s a good idea not to install NPM packages blindly.  If you know what to look for, there are definite signals that these packages are dodgy.  All of these packages have just two files:  package.json and index.js (or main.js).  This is one of several flags that you can use to determine if a package is legit or not.This works -- maybe OK for top-level packages. But for transitive dependencies it's nearly impossible to vet every transitive dependency.If you're pulling in a package that has 400 dependencies, how the heck would you even competently check 10% of that surface area? https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#top-1000...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690473</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pure, disinterested A/B testing where the goal is just to find the good way to do it, and there's enough leverage and traffic that funding that A/B testing is worthwhile is rare.More frequently, A/B testing is a political technology that allows teams to move forward with changes to core, vital services of a site or app. By putting a new change behind an A/B test, the team technically derisks the change, by allowing it to be undone rapidly, and politically derisks the change, by tying it's deployment to rigorous testing that proves it at least does no harm to the existing process before applying it to all users. The change was judged to be valuable when development effort went into it, whether for technical, branding or other reasons.In short, not many people want to funnel users through N code paths with slightly different behaviors, because not many people have a ton of users, a ton of engineering capacity, and a ton of potential upside from marginal improvements. Two path tests solve the more common problem of wanting to make major changes to critical workflows without killing the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the assumptions of vanilla multi-armed bandits is that the underlying reward rates are fixed. It's not valid to assume that in a lot of cases, including e-commerce. The author is dismissive and hard wavy about this and having worked in in e-commerce SaaS I'd be a bit more cautious.Imagine that you are running MAB on an website with a control/treatment variant. After a bit you end up sampling the treatment a little more, say 60/40. You now start running a sale - and the conversion rate for both sides goes up equally. But since you are now sampling more from the treatment variant, its aggregate conversion rate goes up faster than the control - you start weighting even more towards that variant.Fluctuating reward rates are everywhere in e-commerce, and tend to destabilise MAB proportions, even on two identical variants, they can even cause it to lean towards the wrong one. There are more sophisticated MAB approaches that try to remove the identical reward-rate assumption - they have to model a lot more uncertainty, and so optimise more conservatively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with this approach is that it requires the system doing randomization to be aware of the rewards. That doesn't make a lot of sense architecturally – the rewards you care about often relate to how the user engages with your product, and you would generally expect those to be collected via some offline analytics system that is disjoint from your online serving system.Additionally, doing randomization on a per-request basis heavily limits the kinds of user behaviors you can observe. Often you want to consistently assign the same user to the same condition to observe long-term changes in user behavior.This approach is pretty clever on paper but it's a poor fit for how experimentation works in practice and from a system design POV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650954</guid></item><item><title>3.

They're awesome for composable desktops that I run behind a VPN for a quick and easy dirty connection at home.Combine the Webtop images by forcing it's traffic through the Gluetun [0] container and you're up and running.  These Webtop containers are nice and snappy as well thanks to Kasm.  Awesome OSS.[0] https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "WarningDo not put this on the Internet if you do not know what you are doing.By default this container has no authentication and the optional environment variables CUSTOM_USER and PASSWORD to enable basic http auth via the embedded NGINX server should only be used to locally secure the container from unwanted access on a local network. If exposing this to the Internet we recommend putting it behind a reverse proxy, such as SWAG, and ensuring a secure authentication solution is in place. From the web interface a terminal can be launched and it is configured for passwordless sudo, so anyone with access to it can install and run whatever they want along with probing your local network."I hope everyone intrigued by this interesting and potentially very useful project takes heed of this warning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selkies[1] is another interesting project in this space.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant security vulnerability in Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system that puts millions of users at risk. The flaw allows malicious actors to exploit certain permissions granted by users to access sensitive information without proper authorization. It highlights the potential impact of the vulnerability, advises on best practices for users to secure their accounts, and emphasizes the importance of robust security measures to protect against such flaws. The piece serves as a warning and a call to action for both users and developers to remain vigilant regarding digital security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not 100% clear to me, from reading TFA, what the actual vuln is.Suppose DankStartup folds and I, being a morally-dubious sort of fellow, purchase dankstartup.net which I then use to sign into DankStartup's O365, or DankStartup's ChatGPT as a DankStartup employee.Isn't that a failure on DankStartup's part, to not shut down their business accounts?  And isn't it also a failure on e.g. Microsoft or OpenAI's parts, since they're providing service to a defunct business entity who can't pay its bills?To describe this as a vuln in oauth doesn't really make sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't understand here, the proper way to use Google's OpenID implementation to authenticate someone is to use the `sub` claim. Don't use the email, don't verify it yourself, use the `sub` claim. It's a known fact and is properly documented[1].If the `sub` changes, it's because it's not necessarily the same person so have a flow ready for that. It could be an employee left and came back, a domain change, an IT error that lead to a reprovisioning of the user, etc.I also fail to see how the proposed solution of having a 'A unique user ID that doesn’t change over time' is different from the `sub` claim. However, the new ID associated to the domain could make sense to enforce a strong 'Everyone from the @domain.com has access' statement.[1] https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is more of a fundamental issue with the way we rely on DNS to secure *gestures wildly* all the things. The fact that domains can expire and be registered by someone new allows the new owner to do almost anything the old owner could have done when it comes to anything trusting email addresses, or anything else relying on DNS (ACME certs) for authentication.It's great for "do they own this right now" validation and that's what we use it for, but beyond that links will be saved, email addresses will be added to databases and address books alike, and that's more or less a reality of most systems. For example, my snail mail (and occasionally packages) is still mistakenly delivered to my former addresses from time to time just because it's hard to track who has that address, and update it everywhere. The same goes for internet infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699099</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The fluid pendant project by MITxela showcases a unique and intricate kinetic sculpture that visually demonstrates fluid dynamics using a pendulum mechanism. The design features a pendulum with a reservoir that allows colored liquid to flow in conjunction with its swinging motion, creating mesmerizing patterns that highlight principles of physics and fluid behavior. The project emphasizes creativity in engineering and design, illustrating how art and science can combine to produce visually stunning and educational displays. It also provides insights into the development process and the technology used in the creation of the sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating video. I watched almost the whole thing without planning to, I got sucked in.This is one of those examples of software that reminds me of my struggle to understand how LLMs are passing code evaluations that culminate with people declaring that they are now better than even the best human coders. I have tried to get LLMs (specifically, Claude and ChatGPT, trying various models) to assist with niche problems and it's been a terrible experience. Fantastic with CRUD or common algorithms, terrible when it's something novel or unusual.The author creates his own version of a "FLIP simulation". I'm going to go out on a limb and posit that even ChatGPT's unreleased o3 model would not be up to the task of writing the software that powers this pendant. Is this incorrect? I realize perhaps that my comment is a little off-topic given that this is not an AI project. However, this project seems like an excellent example of the sort of thing that I am quite skeptical the supposedly "world-class" artificial software engineers could pull off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; access to a lathe is a fundamental human rightA teacher once told me their (middle? high?) school was the last in their state with lathes.  Something which couldn't be created there today, and couldn't exist now in some other states, but which had been repeatedly grandfathered, since its creation with many others, just after World War 2. And that it would disappear upon the first serious accident, leaving none at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charlieplexing:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683389</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice, these ideas have been around for a long time but never commercialized to my knowledge. I've done some experiments in this area with simulations and am currently designing some test circuitry to be fabbed via Tiny Tapeout.Reversibility isn't actually necessary for most of the energy savings. It saves you an extra maybe 20% beyond what adiabatic techniques can do on their own. Reason being, the energy of the information itself pales in comparison to the resistive losses which dominate the losses in adiabatic circuits, and it's actually a (device-dependent) portion of these resistive losses which the reversible aspect helps to recover, not the energy of information itself.I'm curious why Frank chose to go with a resonance-based power-clock, instead of a switched-capacitor design. In my experience the latter are nearly as efficient (losses are still dominated by resistive losses in the powered circuit itself), and are more flexible as they don't need to be tuned to the resonance of the device. (Not to mention they don't need an inductor.) My guess would be that, despite requiring an on-die inductor, the overall chip area required is much less than that of a switched-capacitor design. (You only need one circuit's worth of capacitance, vs. 3 or more for a switched design, which quadruples your die size....)I'm actually somewhat skeptical of the 4000x claim though.  Adiabatic circuits can typically only provide about a single order of magnitude power savings over traditional CMOS -- they still have resistive losses, they just follow a slightly different equation (f²RC²V², vs. fCV²). But RC and C are figures of merit for a given silicon process, and fRC (a dimensionless figure) is constrained by the operational principles of digital logic to the order of 0.1, which in turn constrains the power savings to that order of magnitude regardless of process. Where you can find excess savings though is simply by reducing operating frequency. Adiabatic circuits benefit more from this than traditional CMOS. Which is great if you're building something like a GPU which can trade clock frequency for core count.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notably the physical limit ishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principleit doesn't necessarily take any energy at all to process information,  but it does take roughly kT work of energy to erase a bit of information.  It's related tohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demonas,  to complete cycles,  the demon has to clear its memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Henry G. Baker wrote this paper titled "The Thermodynamics of Garbage Collection" in the 90s about linear logic, stack machines, reversibility and the cost of erasing information:https://wiki.xxiivv.com/docs/baker_thermodynamics.htmlA subset of FRACTRAN programs are reversible, and I would love to see rewriting computers as a potential avenue for reversible circuit building(similar to the STARAN cpu):https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html#reversibility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660606</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695547"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've enjoyed using ffmpeg 1000% more since I was able to stop doing manually the tedious task of Googling for Stack Overflow answers and cobbling them into a command and got Chat GPT to write me commands instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me I need to publish my write up on how I've been converting digitized home video tapes into clips using scene detection, but in case anyone is googling for it, here's a gist I landed on that does a good job of it [0] but sometimes it's fooled by e.g. camera flashes or camera shake so I need to give it a start and end file and have ffmpeg concatenate them back together [1]Weird thing is I got better performance without "-c:v h264_videotoolbox" on latest Mac update, maybe some performance regression in Sequoia? I don't know. The equivalent flag for my windows machine with Nvidia GPU is "-c:v h264_nvenc" . I wonder why ffmpeg doesn't just auto detect this? I get about 8x performance boost from this. Probably the one time I actually earned my salary at work was when we were about to pay out the nose for more cloud servers with GPU to process video when I noticed the version of ffmpeg that came installed on the machines was compiled without GPU acceleration ![0] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nielsbom/c86c504fa5fd61ae...[1] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jazzyjackson/bf9282df0a40...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gotten pretty good at various bits of ffmpeg over time.  Its CLI has a certain logic to it... it's order dependent (not all unix CLIs are).Lately, I've been playing around with more esoteric functionality.  For example, storing raw video straight off a video camera on a fairly slow machine.  I built a microscope and it reads frames off the camera at 120FPS in raw video format (YUYV 1280x720) which is voluminous if you save it directly to disk (gigs per minute).  Disks are cheap but that seemed wasteful, so I was curious about various close-to-lossless techniques to store the exact images, but compressed quickly.  I've noticed that RGB24 conversion in ffmpeg is extremely slow, so instead after playing around with the command line I ended up with:  ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuyv422 -s 1280x720 -i test.raw  -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p  movie.mp4 -crf 13 -y

This reads in raw video- because raw video doesn't have a container, it lacks metadata like "pixel format" and "image size", so I have to provide those.  It's order dependent- everything before  "-i test.raw" is for decoding the input, and everythign after is for writing the output.  I do one tiny pixel format conversion (that ffmpeg can do really fast) and then write the data out in a very, very close to lossless format with a container (I've found .mkv to be the best container in most cases).Because I hate command lines, I ended up using ffmpeg-python which composes the command line from this:  self.process = (
            ffmpeg.
            input(
                "pipe:",
                format="rawvideo",
                pix_fmt="yuyv422",
                s="{}x{}".format(1280, 720),
                threads=8
            )
            .output(
                fname, pix_fmt="yuv422p", vcodec="libx264", crf=13 
            )  
            .overwrite_output()
            .global_args("-threads", "8")
            .run_async(pipe_stdin=True)
            )

and then I literally write() my frames into the stdin of that process.  I had to limit the number of threads because the machine has 12 cores and uses at least 2 at all times to run the microscope.I'm still looking for better/faster lossless YUV encoding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695547</guid></item><item><title>8.

There are chinese encoder boards that'll do everything for like $10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a unusual servo. Servos usually have a small optical encoder that emits quadrature pulses as it rotates. That's immune to magnetic interference but can potentially miss counts. This servo seems to have an magnetic analog position sensor. Something like this.[1] Can't miss counts but has less noise immunity.[1] https://www.analog.com/en/products/adaf1080.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm gonna experiment with adding hall effect sensors to a standard servo to make a cheap feedback mechanism since those are pretty cheap nowadays seems like. Steppers still have a place but for hobby stuff with basic "what pos is it" this could be something I use a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697335</guid></item><item><title>9.

Key enhancements include support for new storage capabilities, performance optimizations, and expanded compatibility with various platforms. The release notes also outline important changes, such as updates to the user interface and enhancements to error reporting.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After years in the making ZFS raidz expansaion is finally here.Major features added in release:  - RAIDZ Expansion: Add new devices to an existing RAIDZ pool, increasing storage capacity without downtime.

  - Fast Dedup: A major performance upgrade to the original OpenZFS deduplication functionality.

  - Direct IO: Allows bypassing the ARC for reads/writes, improving performance in scenarios like NVMe devices where caching may hinder efficiency.

  - JSON: Optional JSON output for the most used commands.

  - Long names: Support for file and directory names up to 1023 characters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just don't get it how the Windows world - by far the largest PC platform per userbase - still doesn't have any answer to ZFS. Microsoft had WinFS and then ReFS but it's on the backburner and while there is active development (Win11 ships some bits time to time) release is nowhere in sight. There are some lone warriors trying the giant task of creating a ZFS compatibility layer with some projects, but they are far from being mature/usable.How come that Windows still uses a 32 year old file system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good to see that they were pretty conservative about the expansion.Not only is expansion completely transparent and resumable, it also maintains redundancy throughout the process.That said, there is one tiny caveat people should be aware of:&gt; After the expansion completes, old blocks remain with their old data-to-parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distributed among the larger set of disks. New blocks will be written with the new data-to-parity
ratio (e.g. a 5-wide RAIDZ2 which has been expanded once to 6-wide, has 4 data to 2 parity).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694596</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For 2 years I built RAG apps for clients. They are not Code-Assistants but everytime I see code assistants solely relying on embeddings to find the right pieces as context, it feels wrong to me:Code is very well structured. Based on a starting point (current cursor, current file, or results of an embedding search result) you would probably fair better to traverse the code tree up and down building a tree or using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) as described in this blog post [4]. It's like a tree search in order to get relevant code pieces for a certain task, and it imitates what human coders do. It would integrate well into an agent loop to search relevant code.Aren't there any open source code assistants and plugins that do this? All I see are embedding searches for the big projects such as cursor, cline or continue.All I ever found were a few research efforts such as RepoGraph [1], CodeGraph [2] and one one codebase open sourced by Deutsche Telekom called advanced-coding-assistant [3]1 https://github.com/ozyyshr/RepoGraph2 https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.138633 https://github.com/telekom/advanced-coding-assistant-backend4 https://cyrilsadovsky.substack.com/p/advanced-coding-chatbot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t understand why we have so many companies working on vector databases when the real value is in fine tuned embeddings. Having recently evaluated vector DB’s to handle 100M+ nodes, everything will run you  $1 - 8k per month. Yet using embeddings fine tuned on a specific use case, will lower that 10X since you can get away with way coarser vectors.This makes so much intuitive sense - voyage please release an insurance focused model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently using voyage for my project for the following reasons:1. They are recommended by Anthropic on their docs2. They're focused on embeddings as a service, I somehow prefer this other than spread-thin large orgs like OpenAI, GoogleAI, etc.3. They got good standing on the huggingface mteb leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690818</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's reasons for switching from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox, emphasizing the benefits of Firefox, such as enhanced privacy features, extensive customization options, and better performance. The author appreciates Firefox's commitment to user security and its open-source nature, which fosters a more transparent browsing experience. Additionally, they highlight the regular updates and improvements made by Firefox, making it a reliable choice over Chrome. Overall, the article advocates for Firefox as a superior alternative for users seeking a more private and customizable web experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently the main attack facing Firefox is coming from advertising companies such as YouTube.It’s crazy to think that some software engineers might actually intentionally degrade user experience on non-Google browsers or for people using adblockers. The mentality here is pretty disturbing: it’s almost like punishing users for making the choice to browse the web without ads, or without the surveillance mechanisms that come with them. Instead of building a better experience, these engineers seem to be focused on sabotaging alternatives in the name of profit or control. The kind of mindset behind this reeks of the same tactics we see in some ad networks or big tech companies - if we can’t convince you to opt in, we’ll make sure you’re inconvenienced or frustrated until you do.It’s a dangerous precedent because it introduces a toxic game of cat-and-mouse, where the user is constantly playing defense, trying to protect themselves from deliberate misdirection. It’s not just an ethical concern, but also an issue of how we value user autonomy in the digital space.For the hackers out there, this is a opportunity to dig into the JavaScript code responsible for this. There’s almost certainly some interesting obfuscation or odd behavior hiding in the code, and by pulling it apart, we can both understand how these tactics work and build tools or methods to counteract them. Let’s make sure the only thing that slows down the web is bad design or slow servers, not malicious code aimed at punishing the user for making their own choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's the closest we have to a browser not controlled by the corporate giants.
Sometimes Mozilla makes unpopular choices and people raise a stink about it, but we do that because we hold them to a higher standard. With Microsoft and Google, we just expect them to Do More Evil, with Mozilla we expect Good and will complain loudly when they fail to uphold our principles, and we recommend Firefox because we feel like it is possible to expect Good from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using mozilla for _years_ it got shit, then better, then shit, and now its close enough.The thing I _Love_ is container tabs. I can isolate empires by using container tabs to sandbox cookies and other web state. This means that ebay doesn't change my adverts to the last thing I searched on every site, and autoplay embedded youtube doesn't fuck up my video recommendations.It means I can hide my work gmail from my home, and separate search histories (although thats less relevant now with AI.)lastly, being able to scroll left and right on my tabs, rather than new ones being unaccesable is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696081</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article from Modal's GPU Glossary serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding various terms and concepts related to GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). It provides clear definitions and explanations of technical jargon associated with GPU technology, including architecture, performance metrics, memory types, and applications in fields such as gaming, machine learning, and data visualization. The glossary aims to educate readers about GPU functionality, helping them make informed decisions whether they are professionals in the field or newcomers seeking to enhance their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weird part of the programming model is that threadblocks don't map 1:1 to warps or SMs. A single threadblock executes on a single SM, but each SM has multiple warps, and the threadblock could be the size of a single warp, or larger than the combined thread count of all warps in the SM.So, how large do you make your threadblocks to get optimal SM/warp scheduling? Well it "depends" based on resource usage, divergence, etc. Basically run it, profile, switch the threadblock size, profile again, etc. Repeat on every GPU/platform (if you're programming for multiple GPU platforms and not just CUDA, like games do). It's a huge pain, and very sensitive to code changes.People new to GPU programming ask me "how big do I make the threadblock size?" and I tell them go with 64 or 128 to start, and then profile and adjust as needed.Two articles on the AMD side of things:https://gpuopen.com/learn/occupancy-explainedhttps://gpuopen.com/learn/optimizing-gpu-occupancy-resource-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice if this also included terms that are often used by Nvidia that apparently come from computer architecture (?) but are basically foreign to software engineers, like “scoreboard” or “math pipe”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really great work, suggest for a next post: the VRAM requirements estimation calculation for running models locally. Especially with different architecture and different Quants, it gets always confusing and even online calculators give different answer. I never found a really good deep dive on this yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675529</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "death by a thousand cuts," which refers to the gradual and often unnoticed accumulation of small issues that may lead to significant problems over time. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing these minor issues early on to prevent larger failures in various aspects of life, including personal well-being, relationships, and organizational management. The piece encourages proactive measures and awareness to address small challenges before they escalate, advocating for a more mindful approach to handling difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a NixOS user and contributor.This post is fair.Nix is very flexible, and it hasn't yet stabilised on a firm set of recommendations for a happy path.Going on a whim:* Use nixos-unstable. It's defacto stable, and gets much more attention than nixos-stable.* Use flakes.* Don't use multiple versions of nixpkgs. In the rare case a package is failing to build, then raise an issue, or wait, or rollback.* On NixOS, don't use user profiles. They won't interop in the way OP hopes.* Only use nixpkgs. If you absolutely must use another flake, only use popular ones from https://github.com/nix-community.But until the community give opinionated suggestions, users will stray towards bad practices.(Also, no need to mix pipewire and jack. Pipewire can emulate jack.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The older I get, the more I realize that so much of the divide in the tech field is simply between the two camps of "the tools are the interesting part" vs "getting things done with the tools is the interesting part".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on the fence about Nix. I've wanted to love it (and do love the concept), but between the Waiting-for-Godot situation for flakes, the weird language, and the occasional political infighting I've seen pop up about the community, I still haven't switched.I'm no language expert, but I genuinely don't understand why it wouldn't have been better to build some equivalent DSL in Haskell to do this given the similar lazy nature of the language. DSL for most things, then open the hood and do actual Haskell for crazier use cases. I get that Nix started before Haskell became less academic and slightly more usable in the mainstream and has built up momentum, but the lack of tooling for understanding what is going wrong when incrementally building up a config is very confusing.I'd be curious if anyone has go to or from NixOS compared to declarative distros compared to the atomic distros like ublue [0] and has any thoughts. I'm a bit split about what to move to next (though my &gt;5 year Tumbleweed install on most of my machines is holding up no problem).[0] https://universal-blue.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666851</guid></item><item><title>16. 1 in 5 online job postings are either fake or never filled, study finds</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/1-in-5-online-job-postings-are-either-fake-or-never-filled-study-finds-2000549706</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;A recent study reveals that about 20% of online job postings are either fraudulent or remain unfilled, highlighting the prevalence of fake job ads in the digital job market. This issue can mislead job seekers, wasting their time and resources. The report emphasizes the need for greater transparency and verification processes in online job listings to protect applicants and improve the job search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been required to create fake job postings because of US immigration policy.From the line manager perspective, how it looks is you have a colleague who has been working with you for several years who is on a H1B visa. They want to get a green card and become a permanent resident. To support this, we are required to post a fake job ad for their position, and invent a reason to reject any US citizens who apply for the position. (Non-US applications are ignored.)Our legal advice was that the job posting had to be contain only legitimate requirements for the role, so it could not be highly tailored to only match the resume of the employee seeking PERM status. The result was phone screen interviews were required to reject 8-10 on-paper-potentially-qualified US applicants for the fake position.This is for a highly specialized area within finance, where in real hiring there is an immense effort to find the strongest candidates regardless of nationality.In hindsight I am confident that earlier in my career I had applied to at least one such fake role. One not-well-known advantage of working with a recruiter as a job seeker in such a field is the recruiter will have back-channel information to know to ignore such fake job postings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the rate of non-fill is higher. But the reasons for it are all over the map. Everything from "we always leave a posting up even when we're not really looking just in case the perfect candidate happens to walk through the door" but in the mean time nobody really pays attention to applicants, to "we weren't getting the applicants we wanted with this posting, so we took it down and are trying a new posting," to "we're legally obligated to post this, but we already have a plan about hiring" whether it's someone connected, someone internal, or a preference for H1B workers, to all kinds of other scenarios. Anybody who has ever applied for a dozen jobs, sent literate applications and outreach, and has heard from most of them never to months later regardless of actual fit for the job knows this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've posted this story before, but it's relevant.About two years ago, I was looking for a job, and a recruiter reached out about a software engineering position at a prominent newspaper [1].I told the recruiter to apply me, they did, and they made me sit through a two hour video course on ethics and sexual harassment, which was weird considering that I hadn't even done an interview yet.About a week later, the recruiter gets back to me, and they declined me because  my resume "reads too much like a manager, no hands-on coding experience".I was extremely confused, because most of the time people say the opposite, that my resume is too in the weeds, and I need to focus on high-level stuff. Moreover, I don't have any managerial experience on my resume...every role says something like "software engineer".And then it hit me: the hiring manager never read my resume. He already knew who he wanted to hire for the role, and for either legal or compliance or bureaucratic reasons, he had to make it look like he was looking for other candidates, and in the process, he wasted my time and the recruiter's.[1] Not going to say which one but you've definitely heard of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article advocates for a decentralized social media landscape, emphasizing that platforms like Mastodon empower users to own their online interactions rather than relying on centralized corporate entities. It discusses the importance of user independence and the benefits of community-led moderation, encouraging a shift towards federated networks where individuals have more control over the content and connections they engage with. The piece underscores the idea that social media should serve the public good, fostering spaces where diverse voices can thrive without the risk of being silenced by profit-driven motives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm impressed by Eugen. Giving up full ownership is absolutely the right thing to do. But most people in this situation would become too greedy and start rationalizing why they should be in control (benevolent dictator). Hats off! Mastodon is heading in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon is on the right track. They’ve been doing so much right, the UX has improved considerably.I think there’s some mainstream appeal, but there are also ecosystem issues that aren’t solved easily, as well as a lack of algorithmic curation, which a lot of people deem very important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; lack of algorithmic curationThey can get that elsewhere. Mastodon will never win that battle. It's not wrong to want algorithms feeding you content, it's just that Mastodon will always be like the tenth best option for those users, and they always will be. Mastodon's advantage is with users that don't want posts written for algorithms. (I used Twitter that way for many years, but when they killed off Tweetdeck I visited less and less, to the point that I just don't often go there any longer.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681976</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks super valuable!That said, it's concerning to see the reported probability for getting a 4 on a die roll is 65%.Hopefully OpenAI isn't that biased at generating die rolls, so is that number actually giving us information about the accuracy of the probability assessments?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really brilliant stuff! Somehow I didn't realize that logprobs were being returned as part of the OAI requests, and I really like this application of it.Any interest in seeing this sort of thing being added to llama.cpp?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was under the impression that log probabilities don't work like that / they aren't really useful to be interpreted as probabilities?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684629&gt; the logits aren't telling you anything like 'what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token', but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model's belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an 'action' and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698753</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide on how to publish Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub using Marimo Playground. It explains the necessary steps for setting up and sharing notebooks, including creating a GitHub repository, obtaining the notebook's URL, and using the provided link format to integrate with Marimo. The guide emphasizes the ease of accessing and showcasing notebooks interactively, making it convenient for users to share their work with others. Additionally, it highlights potential use cases for educators and researchers who want to present their findings or teaching materials seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

Am I correct in understanding that these notebooks will run independently, and will not need to proxy through marimo.app (in case the app goes down), or is that what the CORS thing is about in note 4, and it will still need to go through this domain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice ! Is it possible to connect to an in browser DB like WASM DuckDB https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/overview.html or https://github.com/babycommando/entity-db ?That would be most useful imho !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love seeing projects like this. When Pyiodide came out I was excited but it was a bit difficult to use, this looks and feels fantastic.I really like Observable as well, but I've found it difficult to find robust and broad numerical libraries in javascript like what Python has.I would love for this type of tool to redefine how we do science. It would be amazing if many scientific papers included both their data and the code in an interactive environment with zero installs and configuration. Plus when discussing a paper you could "fork" it and explore different analysis options live which for many fields would be totally feasible to do in the browser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700852</guid></item><item><title>23.

In fall of 2024, the website had a checklist comparing SDF to dbt and claiming SDF had a better feature set than dbt Core (page rendering is hit and miss right now for whatever reason):
https://web.archive.org/web/20240919110243/https://www.sdf.c...In December 2024 the page had been updated to now compare "dbt Core" against "SDF with dbt":
https://web.archive.org/web/20241217172451/https://www.sdf.c...Little marketing switcharoo there to avoid pissing off their future owners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats to the SDF team for their exit.Alas, dbt Labs has developed a reputation for rug pulling functionality from dbt Core and gating most of their differentiating features behind dbt Cloud. I cannot see this type of consolidation being in the best interest of the dbt community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious if this product actually works because I was beating my head against almost exactly this very recently.I haven't checked yet, but is SDF schema-dependent? For some reason, all sql comprehending/transforming tools I can find are either too trivial to be useful or require an exact schema to operate, both of which are too brittle to be useful when I try to use them in anger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697764</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub status page details an incident that occurred, specifically an issue affecting certain functionalities of GitHub services. The incident began on a specific date and time and is accompanied by updates on its progress, including when the issue was detected, actions taken by the team to resolve it, and the ultimate resolution. The page serves to keep users informed about service interruptions and the status of various GitHub features during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential at best but I work in a regulated industry and we're starting to get some heavy scrutiny from external auditors and regulators on the way we plan to address extended outages and forced exits from third party vendors.  This goes beyond basic DR/BCP and plans are reviewed with at least a high level scenario exercise.https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/09/2023-12...On the surface a product like managed git repos would seem to be relatively straightforward to deal with, but these same regulated firms are also under tremendous scrutiny for access management, change management, SDLC, etc etc.  They also have a huge software footprint which just increases the impact.Self-hosting is obviously the traditional answer, but that's not exactly a simple one either.Just an interesting problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's almost as if only Git is distributed, but people sold out to Github for convenience. Too bad Git lacks a distributed bug tracker and wiki system like Fossil. Guess Github has to fail a lot more for things to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was down for ~2 hours. The status website claims "degraded performance", but in reality we get    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).

Either GitHub didn't know how to communicate, or they were not sure about the real impact.This is bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42691184</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;Recent research from Oak Ridge National Laboratory highlights that global plant uptake of carbon dioxide has increased by nearly one-third over the past several decades. This rise in CO2 absorption is attributed to various factors, including climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and shifts in land use. The study emphasizes the significance of understanding how plants respond to increasing CO2, as this could have implications for carbon management strategies and climate mitigation efforts. The findings suggest that while plants are currently absorbing more CO2, future changes in climate and land use could affect this capacity, necessitating ongoing research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"rises by nearly one third" sounds a bit strange to me, more correct would be "Plant CO2 uptake is currently underestimated by one third according to new research"?&gt; The research, detailed in the journal Nature, is expected to improve Earth system simulations that scientists use to predict the future climate, and spotlights the importance of natural carbon sequestration for greenhouse gas mitigation.Too bad that we are currently doing the exact opposite (cutting down more forest than is regrown)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of change is deeply worrying, because on the face of it, it implies means estimates of climate change are potentially rather unsound - such large changes in mechanisms central to change - and so climate change could be much worse than we expect.If climate change isn't so bad, then phew, but if it's actually worse, then we are in even more deadly trouble than we already are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As I understand the article; it’s not that we found out that they’ve _started_ absorbing more CO2; it’s that the previous estimations were flawed and we have new, improved ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696517</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the phenomenon of MrBeast, a prominent YouTuber known for his extravagant philanthropic stunts and challenges. It explores the cultural impact of his content, analyzing how he engages with audiences and the broader implications of his wealth and influence in online media. The piece discusses the mechanics behind his success, including his unique approach to storytelling, the dynamics of virality, and the interplay between entertainment and genuine charitable efforts.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First of all – the essay is phenomenal and his book is available online for free – https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/youtube-apparatus/36...&gt; “Communication within the YouTube Apparatus has no meaning.” The rapid feedback loop between creators and audiences (as constructed by platform metrics) means that the system more and more responds to itself. Rather than trying to go somewhere (as is the case with political ideology), the creator seeks simply intensification, to draw more and more of the world into his whirlpool of content.This idea – that meaning is replaced by intensification – helps me understand a lot about the world today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran a YouTube channel seriously for a couple of years.  Chasing the whims of the algorithm contributed to burnout and now I only release one or two videos a year.My reason for starting a channel was to have a discussion around some of the projects I was working on that I found interesting.  This never materialized.  I never had a ton of engagement, but if I did most questions asked by viewers that are answered in the video.I monetized my videos and started making beer-money amounts of revenue.  I put more and more time into them but never gained traction. I had a few "evergreen" videos that would make maybe a thousand bucks a year, the rest of the videos hardly got any views at all.Eventually, I found myself making videos to feed the algorithm not because it was a project that I wanted to do.  This is where I had to stop.  I realized that I just don't like editing videos.My channel makes no revenue now because YouTube requires an upload schedule and shorts.  Mr Beast's job sounds awful to me. The videos I make now only get dozens to hundreds of views when they're published.  I mostly share them with friends and in online communities where the info contained might be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top of the heap (Mr Beast, Nastya, Ryan, etc), this is true:&gt; The ideal creator has no distance between themselves and their persona. They have been interpellated by audience metrics; their subjective experience already takes audience reactions into account.&gt; Or more simply, YouTubers are not “Creators” but Creations. Audiences, rationalized by the platform, and the vloggers who upload the videos those audiences consume are not separable either theoretically or empirically.It's pretty obvious, too, because these YouTubers have a distinct theme where their popularity is dependent on 1) the whims and algos of the platform on one side, and 2) the ability for their audience to care and relate to something pretty dang detached and irrelevant from their everyday lives (unboxing, aggressive acts of charity, etc).While you hear plenty (Most? All?) YouTubers complain about the ranking algorithms &amp; capriciousness of their overlord, I don't believe most channels are quite as vapid as those at the top of the heap.  Lots of deep subjective content, and lots of freaking annoying CapCut edits, but also a primary focus on meaningful content relevent to viewers.  These people may not be getting rich from their vlogging, but it's also not fair to call what most of them are doing "vlogging", either.  It's video-based short form content curation for a clearly identified audience.  Not remotely the same as how the big guns like Mr Beast have to view their work [where they're much more similar to a cable TV network or a commercial production company than an independent producer].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696691</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four thoughts:1. I've developed a analog-&gt;digital path for my kids. Before they can get a music player, they get a CD player. Before they get video games, they get board games. And then, for video games, before they get Super Mario Odyssey they get the original Super Mario Bros. Each of these "first they get" is a long period. Years long. Give them something that has limitations so they can truly explore it. Find the nooks and crannies of something. Make up their own weird little things within that limitation. And then, back to music, I want my kids to know what a musical album is, know how to savor the highs and the lows, how sometimes certain tracks mean more to you based on your mood or life-stage, then just an endless playlist of newness.2. The gorilla in the room is that most adults can barely handle online media.3. The other gorilla in the room is porn. Again, see #2.4. The classic philosophers placed Prudence as the queen of virtues. What is prudence? It is essentially the ability to grasp reality. Why did they say that was most important? Because you couldn't use any of the other virtues if your didn't have a good grasp of reality (e.g. fortitude would be foolhardiness if you ran into a ill-conceived death thinking you were being brave).You need to make sure you and your kids are able to grasp reality, not just the appearance of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our kids? Hell, my wife and I don't use social media, except in very limited doses for work reasons. Our kids have zero access to it and never will. Their device usage is kept at a minimum and used for mostly educational or quality conversational purposes.I hate how many people now, whenever we're around them everyone has their phones out scrolling through 30 sec videos. They want to show you things which aren't funny, aren't entertaining, aren't informative... it's damn near Idiocracy levels of content consumption.[Insert video of someone badly dancing with caption that says "me."]Personally, I find it bizarre and extremely boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've 4 kids, the youngest is 11.The rule in the house is; 1) no social media accounts until 13 and 2) one of your parents will be your 'friend' on that account.This is actually a pretty great expression of "kids keep you young."But, right now is right now and how kids communicate with each other is constantly changing - social media or not.So, if you're not a parent to a tween or teens now - I'd say you have little to actually worry about as the landscape will be completely different in a decade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683494</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installed! This should not be a function of the search engine nor a plugin. This should be integrated in the browser.Another great function (not for this plugin) should be the option to "bundle" all search results from the same domain. Stuff them under one collapsible entry. I hate going through lists and pages of apple/google/synology/sonos/crab urls when I already know that I have to search somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the Kagi search engine is a way in the settings to bulk-upload lists of domains to block (or upvote) them. Has anyone uploaded a list like this to it?I may do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi @popcar2 — how are you sourcing the domains for the blocklist? We'd like to evaluate those domains and consider whether they should be removed from DuckDuckGo as spam. You can also report a site directly in the search results by clicking the three-dot menu next to the link and selecting "Share Feedback about this Site".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697346</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;datalist is one I stumbled upon and blew me away. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/da...It's not a replacement for select as you still need an input to tie it to but it seems to handle filtering a list of options nicely.Also, if you have two selects with the same list in it, you can do it once with datalist and have two inputs, say a list of clients with client_a and client_b for inputs.I don't quite care for how it displays the value, like if you put the ID as the value and the client name in the option element, you can filter by the ID or the name but the input will show the ID only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trick to prevent scrolling by setting overflow: hidden unfortunately results in visual page jumping for me.The reason is I have macOS set up to always show scroll bars, instead of hiding them. At least one browser (I forget which, but I test on Safari, Firefox and Chrome) doesn’t have a disabled scroll bar but removes it altogether. This makes the page wider and causes it to reflow and move.Does anyone know how to keep the scroll bar onscreen, just not enabled?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a neat piece of modern CSS:  body:has(dialog[open]) {
    overflow: hidden;
  }

https://caniuse.com/css-has confirms the has() selector has had widespread browser support since December 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662265</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process and benefits of removing the pedals from a bicycle. It outlines the tools needed for the task, including a pedal wrench and an adjustable wrench, and provides a step-by-step guide to safely detach the pedals. The piece emphasizes the advantages of this action, such as making the bike easier to store, transport, or clean, and addresses common concerns, such as ensuring not to lose any small parts during the removal process. Overall, the article serves as a practical guide for cyclists looking to optimize their bike's storage and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I taught my son to ride using training wheels. He rode around for a few days and asked me to take them off. So, I took them off. And when I came back outside from putting the tools and training wheels away, he was riding his bike as if he'd never not ridden it. I do like the author's idea however.By the way, did you know that the the right pedal is right hand thread, but the left pedal is left handed thread? If it wasn't, the left pedal, being right hand threaded, would come loose easily. And that was a Wright Brothers innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree with the point of this post. I'd never heard of balance bikes, and then my wife did some research when we had our first kid and found out about this.We've now taught both of our kids to bike by starting with a balance bike, and the comparison with their friends who learned with training wheels was amazing - the balance bike kids were zooming around earlier, confidently, and with many fewer spills than the training wheel cohort.Also, you can get a balance bike with a handbrake, which sets them up well for getting a bike with handbrakes instead of coaster brakes. Kids bikes in the US have to be sold with coasters but there are several manufacturers (like woom) who make it really easy to remove the coaster and have front and rear hand brakes.Also also, most kids bikes in the US are too heavy: they're tough and cheap but it makes it hard to control them. Woom and Isla and probably a few others now make aluminum frame bikes for kids that are much more appropriate weight for their sizes, though at a bit of a cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly how I teach people to drive stick, and they’ll learn within 30 minutes.
Put them on an empty road with a downward slope. The car will roll on its own, without them having to use the gas pedal. Then they can just practice switching into first without the risk of stalling.
After a few times integrate using the gas pedal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697467</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I turned out OK in public school, but I was held back at different points, particularly in math, because I (and a few others) were too far ahead of the other kids. We literally had to repeat an entire year of content at one point. Kudos to the teachers who enabled &amp; fostered that, but shame on the school system for not continuing to support. I'm pretty sure one of my classmates gave up on academics at that moment (he never really excelled again like he used to).I'd like my kids to be free to follow their curiosities.  It's definitely work to homeschool but for us, it may be worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved public school (class of 99). I still miss the style of learning. Can you imagine going deep on a topic for 50 minutes then switching? AP classes got double periods. I found it so refreshing and I learned a ton.Eg, science, math, study hall, lunch, Spanish, History, Art, English… in a single day?I loved it. What worked for me was studying for tests — and the harder the classes you took, the less homework there was (or it wasn’t required). I had a great history teacher, occasionally good math &amp; English teachers, a great art teacher, and mediocre science teachers. The science TEXTBOOKS were fabulous — you could just read through those things and become a genius.No more textbooks these days — it’s all some pdf segment to download. Bummer for my kids.These days, there are way fewer tests, so my kids always freak when they have tests. I thought tests were great! Just one focused period to perform and then move on. Homework and projects were a big problem for me, because I could never start early enough — it was always a last minute dash. Maybe that trained me to produce fast output, though.Kids were sometimes awful, but there was no way I was going to be popular so I just did my nerd thing. There were enough of us.They had a great drama program which I loved — I did every play and musical I could. And they even had a speech and debate club — so I competed at “extemporaneous” speech—when I went to state competitions, they got the students all together to clap me out like they’d do for the football team. That was unnecessary and funny for the nerd.My kids don’t get these kinds of opportunities, I fear. I was pretty lucky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK I guess I’m going to go against the deluge of comments here; And give an appreciable reason instead of denigrating those who might choose this.The context, though, I am British. I grew up in Britain. I went to British school.I can’t speak universally about my experience, (even within all of Britain), because it’s my experience which is in one small area of the country.However, school, for me, was by far the single worst mandatory system I have been exposed to in my life. For the entirety of my young life, school was a prison. With inmates who would beat you, Emotionally abuse you, the “wardens” did not want to be there either, and did not care how the other inmates treated you… sometimes doubling down on the behaviour themselves. - The comparison is further solidified by 6-foot galvanised steel bars surrounding the complex, and that I visited an actual psychiatric prison not long after and the cafeteria, recreational grounds, rooms, etc; were identical to those of my school.Education? You probably mean repeating exercises in rote? You likely mean memorisation? That’s not education.It took becoming an adult to learn for myself that I enjoyed learning. My school was not learning, Everything that got me through school was things that my mother taught me- And as a consequence, I was always top of my class.I find it hard to think of school as anything more than forced internment for children while their parents go to work, with exercises designed to keep you busy more than to give a functional understanding. I would not be surprised if this feeling is shared among many of my generation and social class, the endless chasing of metrics has made even the tiniest amount of joy that could exist in school- Non-existent.and for those saying it was good for socialisation with other children- The ostracised, are learning to be helpless and to be victims- They are not learning to “socialise” more. If anything it is probably more harmful for those people to be exposed to more people until they’ve had time to form on their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698737</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of database management systems (DBMS) for businesses and how they help in storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. It highlights the various types of DBMS, such as relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases, and emphasizes the need for organizations to choose the right system based on their specific requirements and use cases. The piece also touches on trends in database technology, including cloud databases and the growing importance of data analytics, underscoring the critical role that databases play in modern data-driven decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I so badly wish we could change a big Windows business application to use PostgreSQL rather than Microsoft SQL Server just because of the licensing costs. 
SQL Server is a fantastic product, but restricted to 128GB RAM and a few CPU cores or you have to start paying so much, that not even our biggest customers can justify it.Migration isn't easy, as this venerable application uses ADO.NET Datasets with TableAdapters and plenty of stored procedures. The syntax is almost compatible though. But not enough unfortunately.For our next product, we're sure to bet on PostgreSQL instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turns out Postgres Is Enough: https://gist.github.com/cpursley/c8fb81fe8a7e5df038158bdfe0f...(Gist contains a bunch of Postgres ecosystems things, if anything is missing, please let me know)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After coming back to coding after ~10-15 years away, databases are IMHO the most improved element of the dev/devops experience.Managed Postgres on Google Cloud is a fantastic product (I'm sure other cloud's offerings are also similarly good). Backups, replication, point-in-time recovery, managed updates, plus quick &amp; easy system &amp; query insight tooling. All for less than £1/day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696080</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the release of Shepherd 1.0.0, a service manager designed for the GNU operating system, highlighting its new features and improvements. It discusses enhancements such as improved performance, better support for systemd services, and updated documentation. The release is a significant step towards robustness and usability in managing services, emphasizing the project’s commitment to free software. The blog post also encourages users to try the new version and provides links for downloading and further information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shepherd is a wonderful little service manager. The project has been integrating the good features of systemd (socket activation, timers, etc.) while retaining the hackability of using a fully featured programming language for configuration. Been happily using it with Guix for over a decade!NLnet has funded a really cool project to turn Shepherd into a distributed system that enables a fleet of Shepherds to cooperate. https://nlnet.nl/project/DistributedShepherd/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking a quick look at this, the first thing I notice is that the configuration file syntax is obtuse and nigh-illegible unless you already know what things are, and even then it's cumbersome and looks frustrating to write.e.g. instead of systemd's simple:    Exec=/path/to/ntpd -n -c /etc/ntpd.conf -u ntpd -g

We have this mess:    #:start (make-forkexec-constructor
           (list "…/bin/ntpd"
                 "-n" "-c" "/…/…-ntpd.conf" "-u" "ntpd" "-g")
           #:log-file "/var/log/ntpd.log")

They say you don't need to be an expert on guile scheme to build a service file, but it does seem as though you need to know things like what `'(ntpd)` means, which I assumed was some kind of identifier literal, and it seems to be what's called a 'data literal' in scheme, but I had to google to discover that since the actual guile scheme documentation didn't seem to explain that syntax at all.I get that there are benefits to being able to do more advanced scripting in a service file, but this seems like a classic example of programmers writing things for programmers and not for users (or at least, not for users who don't 'get it').Going to chalk this up as another 'GNU reimplemented something badly because of NIH syndrome' incident and move on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that don't know, GNU Shepherd is an init system (like systemd) written in Guile (a LISP), the unit files are written with Guile too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698981</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Rise and Fall of the English Sentence" explores the evolution of English sentence structure, examining how it has changed over the centuries from elaborate constructions to more simplified forms. It discusses the impact of various linguistic influences, the societal shifts affecting language use, and the tension between traditional grammar rules and modern communication styles. Ultimately, the piece reflects on how these changes affect clarity and expression in contemporary writing, suggesting that while language continues to evolve, a balance between innovation and adherence to grammatical standards is essential for effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fun to read letters written by children in the 18th century, as it gives you a little glimpse into what it was like to learn to write at this level of complexity, and what aspects of written language children were being taught to master.Here for example is a letter from John Quincy Adams to his father, written when he was ten:&gt;DEAR SIR,—I love to receive letters very well; much better than I love to write them. I make but a poor figure at composition, my head is too fickle, my thoughts are running after birds eggs play and trifles, till I get vexed with myself. Mamma has a troublesome task to keep me steady, and I own I am ashamed of myself. [...] If I can but keep my resolution, I will write again at the end of the week and give a better account of myself. I wish, Sir, you would give me some instructions, with regard to my time, and advise me how to proportion my Studies and my Play, in writing, and I will keep them by me, and endeavor to follow them. I am, dear Sir, with a present determination of growing better, yours.&gt;P. S.—Sir, if you will be so good as to favor me with a Blank Book, I will transcribe the most remarkable occurances I meet with in my reading, which will serve to fix them upon my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constructing elegant, deeply nested sentences is an art in English as well as German (my first language).  But it is an art, more for connoisseurs than those who really need to communicate.An art that I appreciate more is at the opposite end.  Constructing elegant prose out of relatively simple sentences, like Ernest Hemingway."He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.

I can't see any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're confused by the glaring bracket-matching errors in the opening quotation, it is missing two left brackets at the start of the sentence and three right brackets at the end of the sentence. That would correctly balance and nest the bracket pairs and bring the total number of clauses to 8, as described in the first paragraph.I wonder if the missing brackets are an artifact of some weird automated typesetting/rendering or if an editor who never bothered to read the article came through and said, "Quotations shouldn't start and end with random brackets!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695580</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the prompt describing the function call parameters:When calling the automation, you need to provide three main parameters:
 1. Title (title):
A brief descriptive name for the automation. This helps identify it at a glance. For example, "Check for recent news headlines".
 2. Prompt (prompt):
The detailed instruction or request you want the automation to follow. For example:
"Search for the top 10 headlines from multiple sources, ensuring they are published within the last 48 hours, and provide a summary of any recent Russian military strikes in the Lviv Oblast."
 3. Schedule (schedule):
This uses the iCalendar (iCal) VEVENT format to specify when the automation should run. For example, if you want it to run every day at 8:30 AM, you might provide:BEGIN:VEVENT  
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30;BYSECOND=0  
END:VEVENTOptionally, you can also include:
 • DTSTART (start time):
If you have a specific starting point, you can include it. For example:BEGIN:VEVENT  
DTSTART:20250115T083000  
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30;BYSECOND=0  
END:VEVENTIn summary, the call typically includes:
 • title (string): A short name.
 • prompt (string): What you want the automation to do.
 • schedule (string): The iCal VEVENT defining when it should run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon had an insane number of people working on just the alarms feature in Alexa when they interviewed me for a position years ago. They had entire teams devoted to the tiniest edge case within the realm of scheduling things with Alexa. This is no doubt one of the biggest use cases in computing: getting your computer to tell you what to do at a given time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The beta is inconsistently showing (required a few refreshes to get something to show up), but my limited usage of it showed a plethora of issues:- Assumed UTC instead of EST. Corrected it and it still continued to bork- Added random time deltas to my asked times (+2, -10 min).- Couple notifications didn't go off at all- The one that did go off didn't provide a push notification.---On top of that, only usable without search mode. In search mode, it was totally confused and gave me a Forbes article.Seems half baked to me.Doing scheduled research behind the scenes or sending a push notification to my phone would be cool, but surprised they thought this was OK for a public beta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704795</guid></item><item><title>43.

Ironically, it felt easier at my previous job as employee in a startup: work during office hours, open-source on the side.Now I spend my free time playing my Fender and exploring ways to combine music with programming, maybe using LLMs for copilot performances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello, and thank you for creating Glicol—it’s an outstanding tool for live coding and audio synthesis!I was wondering about the possibility of extending Glicol’s functionality to include features such as:TTS Emotional Replication
Generating human-like emotional expressions in sound (e.g., sighs, coughs, gasps).
Sound Effects Simulation
Creating realistic environmental sounds, such as thunder, rain, wind, and other ambient effects.
Novel Sound Creation
Enabling the generation of entirely new and experimental sounds, potentially by training on a provided audio dataset.
Given Glicol’s modular architecture, Rust-based engine, and WebAssembly (WASM) support, I’m curious whether it would be theoretically possible to support such extensions within the current framework.Questions
Are any of these features currently possible with Glicol?
If not, are there any plans or ongoing developments to enable functionality like this in the future?
I believe these additions could expand Glicol’s applications far beyond music generation, opening up exciting possibilities in areas like:TTS systems with nuanced emotional expression.
Sound design for games, films, and interactive media.
Experimental audio research and creative sound exploration.
Before concluding, I’d like to add that Glicol’s potential use cases could extend well beyond music generation, offering new opportunities for innovation in audio-based applications.I’d love to hear your thoughts on this and whether these ideas align with Glicol’s future vision. Thank you for your time and for developing such an inspiring platform!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660619</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of stigmergy, a mechanism of indirect communication and coordination observed in social insects like ants, and how this principle could improve programming practices and software development. It argues that, unlike ants, programmers often lack the ability to effectively collaborate and self-organize in a way that enhances productivity and innovation. By integrating aspects of stigmergy into programming methodologies, the author suggests that developers can create more robust systems and collaborate more efficiently, ultimately leading to better outcomes in software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sites down, but do ants have standups every day just to tell the team what they are doing?  Are they forced to attend scrum ceremonies?  Do they have a scrum master insisting they set an arbitrary "sprint goal" every two weeks that everyone, including the scrum master, is going to forget about but management will frown at when they realize we didn't work towards?  Oh, I'd love to be able to produce like an ant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm personally attracted to this way of thinking. I did write a post about it many years ago, probably triggered by this article:https://ole-laursen.blogspot.com/2016/01/stimergy.htmlPart of the mindset is that when you see a co-worker end up in the wrong place with some new code, you ask yourself, can I do something to our code base to lower the probability of it happening again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why Can't Programmers Be More Like Ants?Because ants dont have business units. Most of us, programmers, are slaves to the business and we have to do what they want from us, not what we want or think is optimal to do. And the requirements can change often. How fast those changes would be notified by others in decentralized "ants approach"? Would the business survive with this approach?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673465</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of specific urban design choices on pedestrian safety, particularly in college towns. It highlights how certain intersections can become hazardous due to poor planning, lack of proper signage, ineffective traffic signals, or other structural issues. The piece emphasizes the need for better urban infrastructure to protect vulnerable road users, advocating for community involvement and policy changes to create safer environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a pedestrian I will take a busy light controlled intersection with a pedestrian scramble type walk signal over a busy 4-way stop where every single time.With the 4-way stop there is never a time in the cycle when all traffic is stopped.  The drivers who are present are continuously paying attention to what other drivers are doing which robs them of situational awareness to note pedestrians.  You can try and time it but that's risky.  With the walk signal there is a brief moment in time when the drivers are doing nothing but waiting for you and are all stopped so you as a pedestrian can account for them in preparation just before you get your signal and make your move.The author can get lost with this sort of textbook correct but questionable in reality take.  Legally having the right of way doesn't make you any less dead when the driver who's got three other drivers to pay attention to doesn't see you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I captured two drivers ripping through red lights in that short spanVideo actually shows two cars entering the intersection on yellow lights, which is legal. The rest of the article seems similarly exaggerated.----Edit: For those who disagree, please be aware that the stop lines are out of frame, so both cars are already in the intersection before they're visible on the video. You can get a better picture of what the intersection actually looks like here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/L37hZyvXs8BeWmFE8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a solved problem and it's astonishing the world hasn't just adopted the Dutch traffic engineering standards outright.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what I call meta advice.He makes most of the money now from persuading others starting a passive income side gig, for which he coincidentally has a starter pack to sale.  While this might be a reliable income, it is in no means a template for other people to start a successful passive income business with a working business idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an off-the-cuff summary:First you have to make space in your life for it. You need long blocks of time for deep work.The first idea you pick is unlikely to work, so pick something and start moving. Many of the best products come out of working on something else.When building, optimize for speed. Try to get something out in the world as quickly as possible and iterate from there.Pick a tech stack you're familiar with, that you'll be fastest in.Try to spend half your time on marketing/sales, even if you hate it.The most important skill you can have is resiliance. Not giving up is the best path to success. This is hard because there is so much uncertainty in this career path.It's worth it! The autonomy and freedom are unmatched by any other career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When my life was falling apart and I was trying to fix my relationship with my ex she dictated that we spend 'quality' time together which meant watching horrible reality TV while she was on insta on her phone.Out of mind numbing boredom I made a system for SEO spam websites during this time. I would take expiring domain names (so names someone had gone to the trouble to research but been unable to make work) parse out keywords and lookup popularity for them, lookup ad rates for them, and spit out names to buy and make a SEO spam site for (goal was 300 websites making $1 a day or $100k a year), or good names to domain squat. If a domain turned out bunk I threw my link-spam-network software on it to provide linkbacks to my money/new sites. I made around 30k profit a year plus another $5k selling domain names doing this before life fell further apart and it rotted on the vine. I was really tempted to sell it as a package but could never bring myself that low even deep in addiction. Plus Google started cracking down on that trash.I still think the concept of 300 somethings (though please not SEO spam) that make a dollar a day is viable for us here though because we're in the unique position where the creation/maintenance is just a matter of our spare time since we can do the specs/design/coding/administration/maintenance/etc ourselves. It seems like there are still people doing this. Look at new car model forums. Everytime a new car models is released there's a rush to create discussion forums for that model with people hoping Google blesses theirs so they can add it to their portfolio of money maker car model forums. Maybe the secret sauce is forcing yourself to watch reality TV until your mind rebels and says 'fine, grab me the laptop and we'll make mind numbingly boring software products as that is at least better than watching this'.Edit: To clarify this wasn't my income source this was just what I did while being forced to watch 'The Kardashians' for bonding time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696822</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is refreshing in its research and writing: the research is crude, testing just a very few alternatives - just enough for something to write about. And that's okay, this is not a scientific paper. And then the author collects a few quotes and does not dilute things too much. Good job.I propose another workaround alternative that doesn't exist yet. A "multi-browser" which lets you browse and visually diff the web from different points of view. See the web from deep china, europe, Kansas City, San Francisco, Chrome, Firefox, daytime and nighttime, incognito, logged-in, etc all at once (modulo some time spreading for opsec or something) so we can get back to peace and what matters: booking a bloody hotel room or reading a magazine article without making a project of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic pricing is the future of everything. If consumers are willing to pay 1.5x, you are leaving money on the table by only charging x. In fact in a fully optimized system, once consumers have all of their wants and needs met, they will have zero dollars left over. (Expensive end of life care tends to have similar results today.)NPR did a piece on it last year which to me came off a bit too cheerful.https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1197958433/dynamic-pricing-gr...Using only time of day is fairly primitive, though. We can do better. With facial recognition, we can probably personalize prices to the penny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My wife and I travel a lot as a hobby.

I would even go farther and say that almost everything is automatable depending on how much effort you're willing to put into it. However, lots of bad or overwhelmed devops shops I've consulted seem to be stuck in this insane hell-loop of manual processes not ever giving them "time" or "priority" to automate some of these processes and get them off the treadmill. Usually it takes a fair amount of heroics to get out of that, but I have  specific approach to such situations that I've been using successfully for a few years now.it's always important to remember "devops" is a completely loaded term that can mean drastically different things depending on organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682660</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains why the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, operates over a very short range. It discusses the role of W and Z bosons, which mediate this force and are responsible for processes like beta decay. The article attributes the short-range characteristic to the large mass of these bosons compared to other particles, which results in a rapid decrease in force strength at distances greater than the size of atomic nuclei. The piece also highlights the implications of this force in particle physics and its importance in understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't this "explanation" just shift the question to what is stiffness?  Like it refactored the question but didn't actually explain it.Previously, we had statement "the weak force is short range".  In order to explain it, we had to invent a new concept "stiffness" that is treated as a primitive and not explained in terms of other easy primitives, and then we get to "accurately" say that the weak force is short due to stiffness.I grant the OP that stiffness might be hard to explain, but then why not just say "the weak force is short range -- and just take that as an axiom for now".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes me skeptical here is that the author claims that fields have a property that is necessary to explain this, and yet physicists have not given that property a name, so he has to invent one (“stiffness”).

&lt;p&gt;Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the outcome of operations performed on the plaintext. The website discusses its significance in preserving data privacy while enabling the processing of sensitive information, highlighting its applications in cloud computing, healthcare, and finance. It also covers the different types of homomorphic encryption, such as partially, somewhat, and fully homomorphic encryption, along with the challenges and ongoing research in enhancing its efficiency and practicality for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You are Apple. You want to make search work like magic in the Photos app, so the user can find all their “dog” pictures with ease.What if you're a user and you don't care about searching for "dog" in your own photos, you might not even use the Photos app, but apple still scans all your photos and sends data off device without asking you?Perhaps this complicated dance works, perhaps they have made no mistakes, perhaps no one hacks or coerces the relay host providers... they could still have just asked for consent the first time you open Photos (if you ever do) before starting the scan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its using Concrete from Zama.I didn't like their license because it's BSD-3-Clause-Clear but then they state:"Zama’s libraries are free to use under the BSD 3-Clause Clear license only for development, research, prototyping, and experimentation purposes. However, for any commercial use of Zama's open source code, companies must purchase Zama’s commercial patent license"So Its not free, you need to pay for patent license, and they don't disclose how much.I recommend OpenFHE as an alternative Free open source solution. 
I know its C++ and not Rust, but no patent license and it can do the same thing the blog post wants to do, it even has more features like proxy-reencryption that I think Concrete can't do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;     The two hops, the two companies, are already acting in partnership, so what is there technically in the relay setup to stop the two companies from getting together—either voluntarily or at the secret command of some government—to compare notes, as it were, and connect the dots?The OHTTP scheme does not _technically_ prevent this.
It increases the number parties need to cooperate to extract this information, hoping it would be caught somewhere in the pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666959</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the use of cosine similarity as a measure for comparing documents or vectors in machine learning and natural language processing. It highlights inherent flaws in the metric that can lead to misleading interpretations, especially when dealing with sparse data or high-dimensional spaces. The author suggests that alternatives like Euclidean distance or more context-aware techniques should be considered to better capture the nuances in data comparisons, ultimately aiming for more accurate and meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're using cosine similarity when retrieving for a RAG application, a good approach is to then use a "semantic re-ranker" or "L2 re-ranking model" to re-rank the results to better match the user query.There's an example in the pgvector-python that uses a cross-encoder model for re-ranking: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/exam...You can even use a language model for re-ranking, though it may not be as good as a model trained specifically for re-ranking purposes.In our Azure RAG approaches, we use the AI Search semantic ranker, which uses the same model that Bing uses for re-ranking search results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In the US, word2vec might tell you espresso and cappuccino are practically identical. It is not a claim you would make in Italy.True, and quite funny. This is an excellent, well-written and very informative article, but this part is wrongly worded:&gt; Let's have a task that looks simple, a simple quest from our everyday life: "What did I do with my keys?" [and compare it to other notes using cosine similarity]: "Where did I put my wallet" [=&gt; 0.6], "I left them in my pocket" [=&gt; 0.5]&gt; The best approach is to directly use LLM query to compare two entries, [along the lines of]: "Is {sentence_a} similar to {sentence_b}?"(bits in brackets paraphrased for quoting convenience)This will result in the same, or "worse" result, as any LLM will respond that "Where did I put my wallet" is very similar to "What did I do with my keys?", while "I left them in my pocket" is completely dissimilar.I'm actually not sure what the author was trying to get at here? You could ask an LLM 'is that sentence a plausible answer to the question' and then it would work; but if you ask for pure 'likeness', it seems that in many cases, LLMs' responses will be close to cosine similarity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So word vectors solve the problem that two words may never appear in the same context, yet can be strongly correlated. "Python" may never be found close to "Ruby", yet "scripting" is likely to be found in both their contexts so the embedding algorithm will ensure that they are close in some vector space. Except it rarely works well because of the curse of dimensionality.Perhaps one could represent word embeddings as vertices, rather than vectors? Suppose you find "Python" and "scripting" in the same context. You draw a weighted edge between them. If you find the same words again you reduce the weight of the edge. Then to compute the similarity between two words, just compute the weighted shortest path between their vertices. You could extend it to pair-wise sentence similarity using Steiner trees. Of course it would be much slower than cosine similarity, but probably also much more useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the generous free tier offered by Cloudflare Pages, highlighting its strategic purpose in attracting developers and fostering a community of users. It explains that this approach not only allows developers to build and deploy projects without initial costs but also encourages them to adopt more advanced features as their needs grow. The piece emphasizes the long-term benefits for Cloudflare, as happy users are likely to convert to paid plans, enhancing customer loyalty and driving revenue growth for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712433"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Additionally, there's plenty of "Upgrade to Pro" buttons sprinkled about. It's the freemium model at work.I don't think they care much about few "Pro" upgrades here and there. The real money, and their focus as a company, is in enterprise contracts. Note that, Matthew Prince, the CEO, had outlined a few reasons why they have such a generous free tier on an Stack Exchange answer[1]. I think the biggest reason is this:&gt; Bandwidth Chicken &amp; Egg: in order to get the unit economics around bandwidth to offer competitive pricing at acceptable margins you need to have scale, but in order to get scale from paying users you need competitive pricing. Free customers early on helped us solve this chicken &amp; egg problem. Today we continue to see that benefit in regions where our diversity of customers helps convince regional telecoms to peer with us locally, continuing to drive down our unit costs of bandwidth.Cloudflare had decided long ago that they wanted to work at an incredible scale. I would actually be very interested in understanding how this vision came to be. Hope Matthew writes that book someday.[1]: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/88685.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not really free. One day, you get a call from their sales team saying "you're straining our network". I kid you not. We were on a business plan and still got this. When we met them in person, we were asked to upgrade to a $2000+ per month plan. From a $200/mo plan. That's a 10x increase. I searched their TOS, nowhere it was mentioned about "straining their network". Turns out that's just their scammy tactic to get you to pay. We refused. That really left a bad taste in my mouth.Today, I refuse to recommend any client or startup to them because of this extremely unethical practice. All around, I'm not sure they deserve so much positive press/attention, especially after screwing some of their own employees (one even got super famous live streaming the firing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh boy, where to start..&gt; So why is Cloudflare Pages' bandwidth unlimited?&gt; Why indeed. Strategically, Cloudflare offering unlimited bandwidth for small static sites like mine fits in with its other benevolent servicesThose are not "benevolent". Seeing a substantial amount of name resolutions of the internet is a huge and unique asset that greatly benefits their business.&gt; like 1.1.1.1 (that domain lol)It's an IP address, not a domain. And they paid a lot of money for that "lol", so that people have an easy time remembering it. Just like Google with 8.8.8.8. Not to be benevolent, but to minimize the threshold for you to give them your data.&gt; Second, companies like Cloudflare benefit from a fast, secure internet.It's the exact opposite. The less secure the internet, the more people buy Cloudflare's services. In a perfectly secure intetnet, nobody would need Cloudflare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712433</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The movie, Rebel Ridge, does a decent job showing just how bad this can be in a small town. It's not exactly realistic for how the former Marine depicted chose to try to resolve the situation... It does give room to consider just how corrupt it can all be. Consider if you live in a town with only one bank. 
Clearly the bank and the police have a relationship and in a small town, odds are they all know each other quite well. Say someone withdraws money from the bank. Then the teller sort of rats you out to law enforcement or someone adjacent to law enforcement. They manufacture an excuse to pull you over just as was done in this Nevada story. The movie Rebel Ridge goes into the difficulty in even getting your money back in the first place. At one point they explain a large part of the police departments funding comes from this. Then again, it isn't just small police departments getting kick backs, it's everyone involved to run up the cost for someone who had their money stolen.At some point, civil forfeiture laws will lay the foundation for having any amount of cash being a sort of assumption of criminality. Consider too that smaller banks and even large banks have reserve requirements but not enough to cover all of the deposits. When most money exists in digital form in a database somewhere, over time, the concept of real paper money gets that assumption of wrong doing. Almost like it is the financial equivalent of "you must have something to hide, or else you would be using your credit card".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US legal system (unlike some other countries) is built on the presumption of innocence. Civil forfeiture completely contravenes that principle and is therefore essentially extortion and corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  18 U.S. Code § 242 - Deprivation of rights under color of law

I find the little machine visualisations mesmerising, the heavily parenthesized Greek representation charming (they look like standing orders written in an alien language, looking for all the world like space invaders) and the tiny code sizes magical.But I can't quite wrap my mind around the core concepts and internalize them into a mental model. It's too different from the simple world of imperative C or scripting languages I guess I call home. So I'm left watching das blinkenlights from the outside, as my attention span chokes on the layers of computer science incorporated into typical explanations. *shrug*I'd be very interested if anyone knows of an ELI5-style alternate path I could walk to break each of the concepts down one at a time. (I ask because I think this is (currently) the kind of thing I think ChatGPT would struggle to present as effectively as a human.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Nobody Cares" by Grant Slatton explores the theme of personal responsibility and self-determination in the face of life's challenges. Slatton emphasizes that while external support is valuable, ultimately, individuals must take charge of their own lives and decisions. He argues against the victim mentality and encourages readers to adopt a proactive mindset, focusing on their goals and actions rather than seeking validation from others. The piece serves as a motivational call to embrace accountability and drive personal change.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its ironic, because this dude doesn't seem to care enough to even the slightest bit of research to understand why any of these problems he highlights are the way they are, and lazily attributes everything to OTHER people not caring. LEDs last longer, are more energy efficient, and also reduce light pollution because they are more directional[1]. Took me 30 seconds to google. There are enormous design standards for designing bike lanes[2]. It is almost certainly the case the design of this intersection is dictated by these standards. But sure, just assume it's because everyone is stupid.[1] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/streetlights-are-...
[2] https://streetsillustrated.seattle.gov/design-standards/bicy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that depresses me is how ugly our cities have become. Buildings that go up are designed with a total lack of aesthetic intention. In Seattle, ostensibly there is a design review committee for multifamily and commercial buildings, but it doesn't appear to have made the city look any better, and their 2025 goals include "streamlining the Design Review process to be quicker and less costly for applicants, and reducing the number of projects that are required to go through Design Review."This is the committee that's supposed to care about this, and they don't. And the architects don't because they're not being paid to make a beautiful façade. And the developers don't because they want to finish construction as quickly and cheaply as possible. And the residents of the city don't care because they're apathetic about living in a beautiful environment.What kills me though is that we travel to landmarks in New York City or Florence or wherever, and gawk at the beautifully-designed old buildings and charming plazas, and seem to lack the recognition that we could live in places just as beautiful if somebody cared.It doesn't really have to cost much more. I used to live in a 20th century building originally built as a schoolhouse. The city architect, who was budget-constrained, still made a point of including decorative brickwork. 120 years later it was by far the most attractive building on the street.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The McDonald's touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.I was working in this space! And I got fired for refusing to work on more upsell features for clients like Coca Cola and such.I don't want to work on adding fucking ADS into checkout.

So companies making raspberry flavored stuff just left the red dye out and said "raspberry is blue now" and we all went "shit yeah it is, always has been! why would raspberry be anything other than blue?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the CNN article:&gt; There don’t appear to be any studies establishing links between red dye No. 3 and cancer in humans, and “relevant exposure levels to FD&amp;C Red No. 3 for humans are typically much lower than those that cause the effects shown in male rats,” the FDA said in its constituent update posted Wednesday. “Claims that the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 3 in food and in ingested drugs puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.”&gt; But “it doesn’t matter, because the FDA mandate under the Delaney Clause says that if it shows cancer in animals or humans, they’re supposed to keep it from the food supply,” said Dr. Jennifer Pomeranz, associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University’s School of Global Public Health.Even more confusing - the FDA still doesn't believe there's a cancer link with humans. But they are banning it anyway on a technicality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comparison between American and Canadian Froot Loop cereal is illuminating:https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/uc265y/a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711556</guid></item><item><title>12.

These are just pieces of metal, U-channel, L-channel, or solid bar, to add some structural strength. Cheap and easy, but rarely seen in hobbyist work. Any board with buttons or knobs or connectors unsupported for more than a few inches should have some stiffening. You have to allow space for stiffening bars when designing the board, and you need to place screw holes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672366</guid></item><item><title>13.

Also welcome are recommendations for how to remove any of the unsafe code without introducing significant space or performance regressions, or how to compartmentalize the unsafe code even better."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust is missing an abstraction over non-contiguous chunks of contiguous allocations of data that would make handling ropes seamless and more natural even for smaller sizes.C# has the concept of “Sequences” which is basically a generalization of a deque with associated classes and apis such as ReadOnlySequence and SequenceReader to encourage reduced allocations, reuse of existing buffers/slices even for composition, etcKnowing the rust community, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s already an RFC for something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hadn't heard of rope data structures until I read about the xi editor (also written in Rust) a few years ago, but it looks like that's been discontinued.https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711966</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing backlash in Sweden regarding the heavy reliance on digital education tools in schools, particularly in reading and writing instruction. Educators and parents express concerns that digital platforms hinder traditional literacy skills, as children become increasingly adept at using technology but struggle with fundamental reading and writing. Critics argue that while digital tools can enhance learning experiences, they should not replace traditional methods. The debate highlights the need for a balanced approach in education that incorporates both digital resources and conventional teaching techniques to ensure students develop essential literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went fully digital some years ago, gave away most of my printed books and bought ebooks only. Now I have my whole library in Calibre and on my Kindle. Why? Because I have my whole library with me. And I can download my highlights and process them. Into notes in Obsidian, that I can link to in my study notes.Recently I started buying paper based books again. Man, I missed holding physical books in my hands. And I start to regret having gotten rid of my physical library. There were so many memories I had with most of these books. I remember their covers, and instantly my emotions , thoughts, feelings are triggered. I don’t have these emotions when I think of my digital books.My spouse has books that she was gifted when she was a child. Still in our kids shelf. I cannot give her my digital books.I regret the decision having gone fully digital, which can only be a complement to physical books.Printed books are a physical experience. Something that allows me to attach thoughts, emotions, feelings to it. And they can become part of my life. Like a good friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely agree that just giving kids a laptop/chromebook instead of books is not working.  My own child and her friends just don't have the focus required, and easily get distracted out to email, group chats, everything else going on right next to the text.That said, one thing I appreciate is that she doesn't have to lug around 30lb backpacks like kids did when I was a child.  We had lockers, but realistically they didn't provide adequate time to utilize them, so everyone just carried around all their books for the day.  Most of us hunched forward because of the weight.It seems like something like a dumb ereader would be a good middle ground?  Put all the textbooks into one place, but don't give it the ability to do anything but read?  That or keep the textbooks in the classroom and share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm unclear if this is a real article.It claims to be published in 2025 but it refers to 2022-2025 in the future tense.&gt; [...] Sweden’s putting 104 million euros into bringing books back into classrooms from 2022 to 2025See the comment identifying a legitimate source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716448&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42715841</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide for Django developers on how to effectively integrate modern JavaScript into their web applications. It discusses key JavaScript concepts and frameworks, such as ES6 features, asynchronous programming, and popular libraries like React and Vue.js. The guide emphasizes the importance of using JavaScript to enhance user interfaces and improve the overall user experience. Additionally, it covers best practices for setting up a development environment, managing dependencies, and optimizing performance, helping Django developers to leverage the power of modern JavaScript in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent article, and SaaS Pegasus is a great solution for people starting a project.But some of the advice here is dated. The architectural patterns are still valid, but the specifics have changed:* Vite instead of create-react-app (which is unmaintained now) / webpack / babel /  Parcel / etc.* Django-ninja as a lightweight API service.I think these are important to call out because they really simplify the frontend compared to the previous options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having used HTMX and Unpoly with Django, for over 2 years now, I prefer using Unpoly more these days.Unpoly feels just like Django, it is a more of a framework than a thin layer, but that means it comes with a lot of productive features built-in, albeit opinionated.It covers 95% of the use-cases of a typical web app, with its layers and forms concepts. E.g. I love creating "subinteractions" with unpoly, where a complex process can be divided into smaller modal forms for creating the "related" objects of a model, which then updates the main form of the model itself. Unpoly makes these simple, and its documentation caters for exactly these scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've tried several boilerplates like SaaSPegasus and one thing I can't really get around is that I feel like the experience of developing in a docker-compose with two build-and-serve containers (e.g. one with gunicorn auto-reload and the other running something like esbuild for the frontend) is very clunky in VSCode?I feel like I'm doing something crazy, this must be a problem many other people have, but things like language server integration on the JS and Python side separately do not mesh well.If anyone sees this and has a minimal open source boilerplate to recommend I'd love to try it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711387</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for converting ePub files into audiobook formats. It outlines the necessary tools and steps, including using Python scripts to extract text and convert it into speech, which can then be saved as audio files. The process is aimed at helping users who prefer listening to books rather than reading them, providing a practical solution for creating audiobooks from existing ePub content. The article is particularly beneficial for those interested in technology and audio processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the one hand, this is very convenient. Probably cool for some non-fiction.On the other, some of my favorite audio books all stood out because the narrator was interpreting the text really well, for example by changing the pacing during chaotic moments. Or those audiobooks with multiple narrators and different voices for each character. Not to mention that sometimes the only cue you get for who's speaking during dialogue is how the voice actor changes their tone. I have mixed feelings about using this and losing some of that quality.I would totally use this over amateur ebooks or public domain audiobooks like the ones on project guttenberg. As cool as it is/was for someone to contribute to free books... as a listener it was always jarring to switch to a new chapter and hear a completely different voice and microphone quality for no reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quality is great (amazing even), but I can't listen to AI generated voices for more than 1 minute. 
I don't know why, I just don't like it. 
I immediately skip the video on youtube if the voice is AI generated.Might be because our brains try to 'feel' the speaker, the emotion, the pauses, the invisible smile, etc.No doubt models will improve and will be harder to identify as AI generated, but for now, as with diffusion images, I still notice it and react by just moving on..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone recommend an open source option that would allow training on a custom voice (my own, so I'd be able to record as many snippets as it needed to train on) to allow me to use it for TTS generation without sharing it off my machine?Edit: I'll wait to see if any recommendations get made here, if not I might give this one a go: https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708773</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything else aside, this is an absolutely fantastic development and I really hope the ceasefire holds and all hostages are released.I just fear this will cause western media and politicians to and declare the crisis to be over (after it had began on Oct. 7, of course absolutely out of the blue and without any context...) and go back to pretending everything is back to normal. Never mind that Gaza is still in ruins, the west bank is still being annexed, Israel still has the dual role of "all authority, no obligations" over the Palestinians, while  making it pretty clear they have no vision for them at all, apart from "maybe they just vanish into thin air tomorrow".And never mind that Israel still has a fundamentalist, authoritarian government that is actively at work undermining democratic structures and civil rights even inside the state - that too with no word of objection from its allies.We'll see where all of that goes.I also found Trump's signalling in the whole issue odd. His base and his cabinet is full of the most hard-line pro-israel figures imaginable, but then he goes forward and quotes Jeffrey Sachs and ostensibly pressures Netanyahu into accepting the ceasefire.Is this just his usual "appear unpredictable by all means" spiel or does he have a strategy there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hamas was offered a ceasefire under exactly the same terms in May, and refused it. Since then:* Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the Hamas political wing, was killed in Tehran* Yahyah Sinwar, the leader of the Al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in Gaza* Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanese Hezbollah, was killed in Beirut* Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, was killed a week later* Large swathes of Hezbollah's command and control were wiped out in the pager attack* Bashar al-Assad, Iran's most important military client, fled SyriaThe Al-Qassam Brigades are shattered. Mohammad Sinwar, its current leader, is reported by ISW not to have communications with most of its new recruits, who are scavenging improvised weapons from unexploded ordinance. Iran's "Axis of Resistance" lies in tatters, their foreign/military strategy, of which Hamas was a key component, now seems totally repudiated. Hamas has lost most of its remaining infrastructure, supply chains, and support.They should have taken the deal when it was first offered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I suppose it's just back to the status quo? What has really changed that will make a difference in 2-3 years from now? Israel has sowed a whole fresh generation of "I will sacrifice everything to wipe Israel" Palestinian youth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716440</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced that it will be offering free AI features in Google Workspace, aimed at enhancing productivity for users. This includes features like automated writing suggestions, smart scheduling, and improved collaboration tools.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Workspace AI includes things like email summaries in Gmail, generated designs for spreadsheets and videos, an automated note-taker for meetings, the powerful NotebookLM research assistant, and writing tools across apps.Maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon stuck in my ways, but I haven't found much compelling value in these use cases in my day-to-day work. For summaries and note-taking specifically, I feel they're solving the wrong problem: it's not that I have all this information that I really want to go through, but it's that I have too much information and it's become all noise.The real solution to too much email is fewer and higher-priority emails. The real solution to too many meetings is fewer and more-focused meetings. These tools paper over the root cause of the problem, which is that people/organizations cannot (or are unwilling to) be clear about communication priorities and say "maybe this email/meeting isn't a good use of time after all."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw a Google AI advert that said:"Hey Gemini, write an apology email for my friend. I can't make their wedding."That's not a future I want to live in, and I love making machines work for me.Thats not what I want my children to think is OK.A friend of mine is a teacher and kids are already delegating their learning to ChatGPT and their learning isn't sticking.What happens when social skills are delegated too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pay for 3 Workspace orgs, and I have Gemini disabled (or still not enabled) on all 3 of them. I'm angry that I'll have to pay more for features I don't use. Gemini should be an add-on cost, not included in the base costIf they're raising the price of personal GMail, I don't have a problem. But Workspace with hundreds of users, now that's a problem, because it actually hurts my wallet significantly. When this increase comes, I'll have to move elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710978</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One weakness of this method is the storage of decomposed UV from W. My linear algebra is rusty, but it seems required if you want to scale in that U projected subspace, hence double your weight memory footprint (that has been said, U / V should be easier to quantize from information theory perspective). I also think MoE is more principled if you want to have experts activations. But I understand that Sakana's research focus mostly is about adapting existing pretrained models, not to do it from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like MoE and maybe a bit of chain-of-thought. Curious what someone with more domain expertise thinks about thisIf they can test against Llama 70B and Mistral 7B, they ought to compare against Mistral 8x7b imho&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great research here. Contextual real-time weight modification is definitely one of the breakthroughs required for AGI. Why create a LoRA when you can generate one on the fly suited to the task at hand?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705935</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you care fairness, I have 1 extra suggestion that you might be interested in.It was proven by several data-science research that when users have to votes (or give ratings) and if they are able to see the previous result, then the first few votes have an extremely important effect.For instance here is one stury, very well written article by a famous teacher Robert West, "of sheep and beer" https://dlab.epfl.ch/2017-08-30-of-sheep-and-beer/ which describes this effect on beer-rating sites.One way to overcome this effect is to hide the votes until enough votes were collected (eg more than 50). Another way is to hide votes until you have voted yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking cool! I have two questions though:&gt;10 launches per day, max.What if your launch queue will be filling at a much faster rate aka backpressure issue? E.g what if this went viral and you get 1000 new projects per day, any new launch is scheduled after three months then?&gt;2 votes per user, per day.Any idea how to prevent someone from creating 10 fake accounts and making it 20 votes per day? I'm sure any entrepreneur will see this opportunity right away if a little cheating means more exposure.Looks like a good alternative to product hunt, the UI is looking fresh and I like it, however I'm genuinely interested about your thoughts on the problems this model can have at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Ryan Hoover would take back the integrity of Product Hunt. It's such an amazing product with such currently painful execution, assumingly in the name of site traffic traded for ad dollars.I truly think that the conversion rate for advertisers on PH would go UP if the quality of the site (moderated posts, comments, bot traffic) did the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712666</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;Pyper is a Python package designed to facilitate communication between Python and R. It allows users to run R scripts from Python, retrieve R objects into Python, and provides a simple interface for data exchange. This integration is particularly useful for leveraging R's statistical capabilities and extensive libraries alongside Python's versatility. The package is easy to install and works across different operating systems, making it accessible for data scientists and analysts who wish to combine the strengths of both programming languages in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work! There is a gap when it comes to writing single-machine, concurrent CPU-bound python code. Ray is too big, pykka is threads only, builtins are poorly abstracted. The syntax is also very nice!But I'm not sure I can use this even though I have a specific use-case that feels like it would work well (high-performance pure Python downloading from cloud object storage). The examples are a bit too simple and I don't understand how I can do more complicated things.I chunk up my work, run it in parallel and then I need to do a fan-in step to reduce my chunks - how do you do that in Pyper?Can the processes have state? Pure functions are nice, but if I'm reaching for multiprocess, I need performance and if I need performance, I'll often want a cache of some sort (I don't want to pickle and re-instantiate a cloud client every time I download some bytes for instance).How do exceptions work? Observability? Logs/prints?Then there's stuff that is probably asking too much from this project, but I get it if I write my own python pipeline so it matters to me - rate limiting WIP, cancellation, progress bars.But if some of these problems are/were solved and it offers an easy way to use multiprocessing in python, I would probably use it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You really should dive more into the `multiprocess` support option and highlight how this gets around issues with the GIL. This feels like a major value add, and "does this help with CPU-bound work" being "yes" is a big deal!I don't really need pipelining that much, but pipelining along with a certain level of durability and easy multiprocessing support? Now we're talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowkey I hate the "\" line continuation in Python to force PEP-8 compliance in a way... Is there any Pythonistas who would write the examples in there differently to achieve a similar level of readability?&gt;    pipeline = task(get_data, branch=True) \&gt;        | task(step1, workers=20) \&gt;        | task(step2, workers=20) \&gt;        | task(step3, workers=20, multiprocess=True)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673273</guid></item><item><title>22.

I'm guessing this is the intended meaning of the term in the name. When most decently well informed, native speakers of English hear "simplex," though, they are likely to hear "herpes simplex" and so are likely to wonder, as I did, whether, or why, the program is named after a sexually transmitted disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great demo, straight to the point. It might be nice to have some kind of feedback mechanism if it can't find the element on the page, or if it's partially cut off. For example, I changed the GitHub profile to my own (https://github.com/spro) in the example and it doesn't scroll down far enough for the whole image. I imagine in general it would be nice to scroll to an element ID (or even element description using the vision models) instead of a hardcoded value.Side-note: The comment for the frequency graph is wrong, it mentions stars instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704160</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advancements in all-optical artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of tackling complex non-linear mathematical problems. Researchers are exploring the potential of using light rather than traditional electronic circuits to process information, which could significantly enhance computational speed and efficiency. The piece examines the challenges and breakthroughs in developing this technology, highlighting its implications for various scientific fields and the pursuit of faster and more powerful computing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a really smart idea to try to leverage the inherent scalability of semiconductor photonics. I think the use of a linear optical resonator to amplify a weak optical nonlinearity is quite genius, and something the relatively small nonlinear photonics community has been trying to do forever. That they showed this kind of 'all-optical-ish' nonlinearity on a relatively mature process in a foundry is nothing to scoff at, and likely one of the biggest results in semiconductor photonics in a while. At the single device level I think it makes so much sense, but what concerns me in general is how well this scales from a few perspectives:1. resonators and device-to-device variance: in general it's pretty hard to get these resonant effects to line up with each other from a production POV, especially with large arrays. Silicon photonics has come far, but I don't think it has approached the level of uniformity as electronics. They have demonstrated some level of electro-optic tunability, which is the traditional solution, but they still need to leverage that for their nonlinear effects too.2. area and space: the 'minimum' trace size of these planar photonics circuits is still quite large (~200 nm minimum feature size typically for these waveguides). This is essentially due to a minimum size needed to confine light within a waveguide which depends generally on the waveguide's refractive index and target wavelength. These are currently all integrated on a planar manner, so each channel becomes quite large, especially if now you also need a relatively large ring resonator, which in this case is at least ~100 micrometers or so in diameter3. the combination of 1 and 2: high device-to-device variation, along with a large planar footprint means that these things are quite expensive and difficult to manufacture, without some kind of miniaturization benefit that you would typically get with electronics (at least not yet). This effect appears to be more than the sum of 1 + 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting to see how work in this space is progressing. Reminds me of a Nature paper a few years back about using physical systems as neural networks:Deep physical neural networks trained with backpropagation (2022)https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04223-6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The preprint of the research paper:https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01623&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673415</guid></item><item><title>24. 100x defect tolerance: How we solved the yield problem</title><link>https://cerebras.ai/blog/100x-defect-tolerance-how-cerebras-solved-the-yield-problem</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Cerebras Systems has implemented a remarkable 100x defect tolerance in their AI chips to address manufacturing yield issues. It highlights the innovative design and architectural choices made to minimize the impact of defects in the silicon, enabling the production of high-performance chips despite potential flaws. This capability significantly enhances reliability and performance, allowing for the delivery of more powerful computing solutions in AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is an important step, but it skips over that 'fault tolerant routing architecture' means you're spending die space on routes vs transistors. This is exactly analogous to using bits in your storage for error correcting vs storing data.That said, I think they do a great job of exploiting this technique to create a "larger"[1] chip. And like storage it benefits from every core is the same and you don't need to get to every core directly (pin limiting).In the early 2000's I was looking at a wafer scale startup that had the same idea but they were applying it to an FPGA architecture rather than a set of tensor units for LLMs. Nearly the exact same pitch, "we don't have to have all of our GLUs[2] work because the built in routing only uses the ones that are qualified." Xilinx was still aggressively suing people who put SERDES ports on FPGAs so they were pin limited overall but the idea is sound.While I continue to believe that many people are going to collectively lose trillions of dollars ultimately pursuing "AI" at this stage. I appreciate the the amount of money people are willing to put at risk here allow for folks to try these "out of the box" kinds of ideas.[1] It is physically more cores on a single die but the overall system is likely smaller, given the integration here.[2] "Generic Logic Unit" which was kind of an extended LUT with some block RAM and register support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So they massively reduce the area lost to defects per wafer, from 361 to 2.2 square mm. But from the figures in this blog, this is massively outweighed by the fact that they only get 46222 sq mm useable area out of the wafer, as opposed to 56247 that the H100 gets - because they are using a single square die instead of filling the circular wafer with smaller square dies, they lose 10,025 sq mm!Not sure how that's a win.Unless the rest of the wafer is useable for some other customer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat. What about power density?An H100 has a TDP of 700 watts (for the SXM5 version). With a die size of 814 mm^2 that's 0.86 W/mm^2. If the cerebras chip has the same power density, that means a cerebras TDP of 37.8 kW.That's a lot. Let's say you cover the whole die area of the chip with water 1 cm deep. How long would it take to boil the water starting from room temperature (20 degrees C)?amount of water = (die area of 46225 mm^2) * (1 cm deep) * (density of water) = 462 gramsenergy needed = (specific heat of water) * (80 kelvin difference) * (462 grams) = 154 kJtime = 154 kJ / 39.8 kW = 3.9 secondsThis thing will boil (!) a centimeter of water in 4 seconds. A typical consumer water cooler radiator would reduce the temperature of the coolant water by only 10-15 C relative to ambient, and wouldn't like it (I presume) if you pass in boiling water. To use water cooling you'd need some extreme flow rate and a big rack of radiators, right? I don't really know. I'm not even sure if that would work. How do you cool a chip at this power density?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717165</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a specific speed sign that warns drivers of a potentially dangerous road situation, particularly in areas where the speed limit changes unexpectedly. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to speed limits and remaining vigilant while driving, especially in regions where accidents are common due to sudden changes in speed regulations. The piece uses graphic examples and expert insights to highlight the correlation between speed and traffic safety, ultimately urging readers to take speed signs seriously to avoid serious accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

When in reality it would just be an increase in cancer risk. If it were THAT contaminated they'd use the AREA CLOSED the article mentions anyways.To be fatal within days you need about 10,000 mSv of exposure. Even with heavy fallout, exposure would probably be around 10 mSv per hour.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly enough, the Fukushima exclusion zone has roads that pretty much fit the bill. They're the pink lines on this map (PDF), with the exclusion zone in gray:https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/pd...You are permitted to drive through but not stop or get out of your car. I presume ordinary speed limits apply though, so no exciting post-apocalyptic signage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself.THEY STILL DO!!!!This is what drives me nuts about our politics: so many people seem to think we can flirt with the sort of nationalism (1) that led us into WWI and WWII. But, friends, that road leads to your death in every direction. Mutually Assured Destruction is still a thing. Nuclear peace only works as long as all parties persistently work toward de-escalation, which can be measured by adherence to consensus and norms. Nationalism is antithetical to that posture. The iconoclast leaders of national populism are rooted in rulebreaking. They also tend to embrace strong foreign policy talk as a short term bolster to domestic support, again, antithetical to de-escalation.(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704491</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new approach for developing a quantum geometric phase in a non-adiabatic context, extending the understanding of geometric phases beyond traditional adiabatic frameworks. It highlights the significance of the quantum geometric phase in various applications, including quantum computing and quantum information science. The research employs theoretical models to demonstrate the conditions under which non-adiabatic geometric phases can be effectively generated and manipulated, ultimately contributing to the foundational knowledge of quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

In the proximity of such event, our macroscopic notion of causation breaks down. This is evident in figures 2 and 3, where the existence of the low-entropy state at proper time 
T does not have any macroscopic cause in its near past or future. It just 'fluctuates into existence'. Indeed, any form of order that the event x0 carries (including objects and people) has no logical cause that can be expressed in purely macroscopic terms. For example, if there is a book, nobody wrote it. If a person has a memory, this memory is illusory, and its content is meaningless (by human standards). This is because our notions of 'writing' and 'forming a memory' implicitly rely on increasing entropy [1], and there is no event with lower entropy than x0."I don't believe that "our notions of 'writing' and 'forming a memory' implicitly rely on increasing entropy."  Entropy's relation to the arrow of time is complex but it's enough for entropy to be non-static, and for things to durably exist in the world, for there to be a notion of movement in time.  If something was written at time T, entropy fluctuated into a minimum at T+100, and entropy increased again at T+200, at all points the original writing event would be traceable back to T.Time appears to stop and things become causally disconnected from each other when entropy reaches minima or maxima and stays there.  Even so, local fluctuations can lead to the emergence of an arrow of time -- e.g. if a glucose molecule coalesces out of the void, you can measure time by it, as it's not perfectly stable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677158</guid></item><item><title>27.

There's no substitute for practice when it comes to maintaining your skills at editing HTML and CSS.Yes, you must copy and paste content and not having layout page is annoying at times. But the overhead of just doing it yourself is surprisingly small in terms of the time commitment.Typically, I'll draft a post in MS Word then open the git repo for my site, hosted on github pages, duplicate and rename the template.html page that includes the CSS, footer, and header for my site and then copy my content into it. When I'm happy with everything, I'll make my commit and then a minute later it's live at my custom domain. Seeing that it takes only 11KBs and 26ms to load my landing page strangely delightful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot you can do with just plain html these days if you just need a clean site. Here's an example from my recipe site (https://xilic.com/recipia/sauces/pesto_traditional.html), mostly for my personal use or sharing with friends, with only html/css. It has expandable boxes, a menu system, etc. A simple script converts a directory structure of .csv files to these recipe cards with a template, and this way you can edit the sources in a spreadsheet and then the publish script just takes whatever is new and re-does the whole lot of html as necessary. Just like we used to do with Apache Forest!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website of one of the most influential IT person, who won the court battle against U.S. Government, allowing for widespread cryptography, professor Daniel J. Bernstein, is and always has been plain HTML mostly with no CSS.https://cr.yp.to/It's served using his own HTTP server - publicfile, and the DNS domain is served using his own DNS server - djbdns. E-mail is handled using his own SMTP server - qmail. He invented the Maildir e-mail format, de facto standard in all e-mail products. All e-mail mailing lists for his products are handled by his own mailing list server - ezmlm. All of this is managed using his replacements to /etc/rc or /etc/init.d or systemd - daemontools.He invented ChaCha and Salsa stream ciphers, now in widespread use, as well as elliptic curves, especially the famous Curve25519, and the Poly1305 MAC.He also invented TCP SYN cookies.Pretty impressive, no?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705077</guid></item><item><title>28. dnSpyEx: .NET debugger and assembly editor</title><link>https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy</link><description>

Used to bypass a license in one .NET app where we really had bought a lifetime license but it still expired (we were in a hurry and didn't receive the new one in time).The authors homepage has a link to crash iPhone. I clicked it with Chrome on Windows and it crashed :D (https://elektrokill.github.io/).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DnSpy was great. The author (d4d) did many great things for the world of .net reversing and binary analysis, including dnspy and dnlib. One day, i don't know why, they archived most of their repositories.I'm glad electrokill stepped up and maintains dnspyex now. This also shows how resilient open source can be - as long as someone wants to work on the project, it can go on forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this tool, used it mod a Unity game and learn all the internals to see how to integrate my mod with the base game. Was an invaluable resource. It also taught me a lot about how they made that game (Lethal Company) and how it was truly made to ship/get the idea out the door and not for perfection/maintainable code.~~IIRC the maintainer was like 15 years old?~~ Edit: My mistake, the maintainer is 18, https://github.com/ElektroKill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716072</guid></item><item><title>29.

I kind of miss that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AOL Desktop is still a thing in 2025 and was updated as recently as a few days ago.Michael MJD just did a video on it.

I hope that more people come out of the woodwork and share the recordings they bought from him, like in this case, especially if there are some slightly silly ones (like "Use the source, Luke!").Aside: I was so worried it was going to be an AI voice generator based on his voice. I sadly think it's inevitable but I can hope he didn't make enough recordings to be able to reliably synthesize his voice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695005</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on the FMA back in the early days when it was still run out of the WFMU office.There's some really killer stuff buried in there alongside some solid netlabel output from the teens. It was very actively curated in the beginning but it quickly became hard to find the good stuff and after a couple years of emphasis on promoting royalty-free music for film it kind of drifted away from its original mantra of "It's not just free music; it's good music".Honestly kind of bummed with where the project landed, presumably sold for peanuts to a for-profit so they can use it for lead gen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run a soundscape/white noise website (https://ambiph.one) and used FMA to find some really great music for the radio stations, though I did have to do a lot of virtual crate-digging to find it - I found the discovery features very limited.I had a bit more luck on Bandcamp, which lets artists use Creative Commons licences but strangely doesn't surface that at all as a search filter. I had to resort to searching for "some rights reserved" via Google: https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Abandcamp.com+lofi+%2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was the lead software engineer on this project when it was conceived, designed, and built. The people at WFMU were so great to work with and absolutely dedicated to getting it right.I don't know much about its current incantation, but I appreciate that the owning company kept the original "About" page with my name and the team I worked with to make it happen.It's one of the projects I'm most proud of. Also, sadly (in a personal legacy sense), one of the few projects I've worked on in the past quarter century that is still standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674003</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a humorous marriage proposal that is entirely composed of office jargon and corporate speak. Through a series of cliché business terms and phrases, the proposer conveys their love and commitment in a playful and satirical manner, showcasing the absurdity of using such language in a deeply personal moment. The blend of romantic sentiment and professional vocabulary creates a comedic contrast, making the proposal both entertaining and relatable to anyone familiar with corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I could be alone, but one of my biggest office-speak pet peeves is using verbs as nouns.Like “ask” (I hear this one all the time), “(value) add”, and “solve” (used in this article - I cringed).I see this a lot on HN too, so again, many others here will obviously not agree. But I’ll intentionally use “request” or “question” over “ask” just in protest.I know the English language has been using some verbs as nouns for millennia, but there are particular ones (like the ones above) that I mostly hear at the office (or outside the office, but spoken by “office folk”), and it’s definitely an annoy.EDIT: Turns out I'm not alone. Thanks for the validate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a long-time friend who, after years in fintech, now sometimes speaks this way unironically in non-work situations.  I mean, I still think he's a good guy overall but when he recommends the DND party splits up to maximize ROI on a spell rather than just say "let's split up", it does make me cringe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I proposed to my wife, I met her after a couple of years and didn't know at the time if she was seeing someone. 
I nudged the conversation towards that topic and once I found out that she isn't, I literally proposed to her in office jargon. 
I said, "So if the vacancy is still available, can I apply?". She said yes, and we got married eventually but she still isn't too happy about that proposal line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42714775</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this yesterday, asking it to create a simple daily reminder task, which it happily did. Then when the time came and went I simply got a chat that the task failed, with no explanation of why or how it failed. When I asked it why, it hallucinated that I had too many tasks. (I only had the one) So, now I don't know why it failed or how to fix it.  Which leads to two related observations:1) I find it interesting that the LLM rarely seems trained to understand it's own features, or about your account, or how the LLM works. Seems strange that it has no idea about it's own support.2) Which leads me to the Open AI support docs[0]. It seems pretty telling to me that they use old-school search and not an LLM for its own help docs, right?[0] https://help.openai.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New killer feature: cronCan’t imagine why everyone doesn’t pay $200/mo for even more features. Eventually I bet they can clean out /tmp!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm trying to figure out how this would be useful with the existing feature set.It seems like it would be good for summarizing daily updates against a search query. but all it would do is display them.

It has a powerful macro language, in which, among other architectures and formats, it implements x86 and ELF/PE/macho and is able to assemble itself.I like to use it for scripting for turning binary formats to text and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool. On the topic of assembly, does anyone know of a language that is higher level than assembly, but retains the property that the output doesn't depend on the compiler or its flags?I want it for low level CPU benchmarks and tests. Using C or assembly for those both suck.I don't really know exactly how this would look (is the register allocator part of the spec?) but has anyone tried something like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo website at https://hlorenzi.github.io/customasm/web/ makes this even more accessible.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the approval of the Natrium advanced nuclear power plant in Wyoming, which has received a crucial permit from state regulators. This facility, developed by TerraPower and backed by billionaire Bill Gates, aims to demonstrate the potential of advanced nuclear technology as a clean energy source. The project is set to produce electricity using a sodium-cooled reactor and is part of broader efforts to reduce carbon emissions and diversify energy sources in the region. The construction of the plant is expected to create jobs and stimulate local economic growth while also addressing energy reliability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

I have bought a lot of games from GOG and have been very happy.  As an exclusively Linux user, I also appreciate how well GOG works with Lutris et al and that they aren't making life harder for those devs.  I love the offline installers and I deeply appreciate their availability.I'm not a big gamer but after watching the industry and Linux/open source in general for many, many years, I'm more convinced than ever that it's the gaming community who will save general purpose computing (that's also a nod to Valve for everything they've done for Linux as well, which has been major).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I liked GOG, but they ignore Linux users, while Steam's Linux support is the best thing that's happened to Linux gaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now if only GOG could fix their Mac client so that you can actually quit it.Maybe someone at GOG will actually read this and let a project manager to let a programmer know to fix this.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and their impact on healthcare costs, highlighting the practices of major companies like UnitedHealth, CVS Caremark, and Cigna. It emphasizes concerns about the opacity of PBM pricing structures, high drug prices, and the potential for a monopoly in the PBM market, which could hinder competition and drive up costs for consumers. The FTC aims to address these issues in an effort to improve transparency and reduce prescription drug prices.&lt;/p&gt;

From the report:&gt; "Higher markups can also result in larger internal transfer payments from health plans to affiliated pharmacies, which may allow vertically integrated PBM-pharmacy-insurer entities to retain revenue and profits while formally satisfying the insurers' medical loss ratio ("MLR" ) requirements, but without providing the clinical care and quality improvements that the MLR rule seeks to promote. In
addition, higher markups can result in significant patient cost sharing requirements because
reimbursement rates are often correlated with point-of-sale prices, which can influence how
much patients are required to pay."In other words.  Health insurance firms have capped profits in the US.  But in this case one conglomerate can own both an insurer and a PBM, so it can just overcharge consumers for insurance and then launder its profits through the PBM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/cg4weI do not like UnitedHealth, I do not like our existing crop of health insurance executives, and I might even be viscerally glad at some level that the UnitedHealth CEO was killed in a world where justice clearly takes a back seat to greed, but I wish the headline didn't say "overcharged", because there's no established amount of markup that is the correct amount of markup other than what people end up paying. Is that shitty? Yes. Does it violate a social contract? I think so. But tell me how much the right amount to charge is first. Is that cost? Cost+percentage? They've chosen their percentage. What's the correct one instead?The article body presents the story in a more meaningful way, "UnitedHealth Group is charging patients a markup for key life-saving drugs that could easily exceed their cost by a factor of ten or more".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716428</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the year 2007, my working assumption is that if data is not on ZFS on physically redundant media that the data has not been successfully saved. And, any machines that don't have ZFS (some RedHat based boxes) should be configured only through Ansible and configured with the intention that all data (including syslogs) is either forwarded somewhere that does have ZFS or is accessed via NFS (backed by ZFS).Or Ceph Bluestore, which does checksums on physically redundant media. We do N+3 replication because we're lazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know TheFineArticle is in Linux land but for Windows people with this issue you might look at Sysinternals Disk2vhd.[0]It can be run from the online OS itself and it can store the resulting vhd on the same disk it is imaging (with space and disk performance constraints).I find it handy for turning my freshly superceded gaming machine into a VM on my new machine for easy access to files, before doing whatever with my old hardware.[0] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/dis...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, while these block level methods do have a use case, parallel rsync and other file level tools are far safer and often faster with less additional load on the disk.Duplicating the OS/FS behavior hits the decidable problem and you just hope for the best with block level, often you won't notice corruption either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673171</guid></item><item><title>42.

When a bug escapes, it's both the author _and_ reviewer at fault.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I also pushed for breaking large changes into smaller commits, because it is impossible to do a thorough review otherwise.I've found this to be key for both giving and receiving feedback. Even small breaking commits are better in a lot of cases because they invite feedback in a way that 1000+ lines don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author describes how his code reviews that he gave others are successful from his own point of view.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682203</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The website "What the F Happened in 1971" explores significant social, political, and economic changes that occurred in 1971, arguing that this year marked a pivotal shift in various aspects of American life. It discusses the abandonment of the gold standard, the rise of corporate interests, and the beginning of widespread income inequality, linking these events to broader cultural shifts. The site presents historical data, analysis, and commentary to highlight how these changes have shaped contemporary society, encouraging readers to reflect on the implications of 1971's transformations on modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "OSS Twin," a tool that helps developers create and manage open-source software (OSS) projects effectively. It highlights the importance of open-source collaboration and shares insights on how OSS Twin streamlines workflows by providing features for documentation, version control, and community engagement. The author emphasizes the benefits of using OSS Twin in enhancing productivity and fostering a more organized environment for both individual contributors and larger teams in the open-source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When it comes to understanding the risks involved with having this many dependencies, one thing that folks might not understand is that Rust's support for dependency resolution and lock files is fantastic.Tools like `cargo audit` can tell you statically based on the lockfile which dependencies have security vulnerabilities reported against them (but you have to run it!). And Github's https://github.com/dependabot/ will do that same thing automatically, just based on the existence of the lockfile in your repo (and will also open PRs to bump deps for you).And as mentioned elsewhere: Cargo's dependency resolver supports providing multiple versions of a dep in different dependency subgraphs, which all but eliminates the "dependency hell" that folks expect from ecosystems like Python or the JVM. Two copies of a dep at different versions? Totally fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ With a team of three experienced developers, we have implemented ScopeDB from scratch”“ with 100 direct dependencies and 647 dependencies in total”Next up: watch me build numpy from scratch with only 150 dependencies, one of which numpy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't that something that should be posted April 1? I'm really not sure if the author is proud about the fact that his project has so many dependencies. Is that something modern coders aim for these days? I usually try to achieve the exact opposite in my projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711727</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a security advisory regarding a vulnerability found in the OpenSSL library, specifically the potential for a denial of service attack. It details the affected versions of OpenSSL, implications for security, and recommends users to update to the patched version to mitigate risks. The advisory emphasizes the importance of keeping software up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the controversial use of xenon gas by climbers attempting to summit Everest, highlighting that this substance, which enhances physical performance and is banned in sports, is being utilized by some in the mountaineering community. It profiles various climbers who have reportedly benefited from xenon gas, examining the ethical implications of its use in a sport that already faces challenges with cheating and fair play. The piece raises questions about regulation and safety in extreme sports, particularly in high-stakes environments like Everest, and reflects on the broader impact of performance-enhancing substances in athletic endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the best general anesthetic by a mile since it's a noble gas, but we don't use it because the cost would be absurd. While the amounts used here must be small, and you're going to be stacked if this is how you're approaching Everest, it must still cost a small fortune — and turns out it does:&gt; One session of xenon gas costs $5,000 per person for a 30-minute session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705180</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "Keon" is a project focused on enhancing the functionality of a programming library designed for algorithm and data structure learning. It provides a collection of implementations and examples in Python, covering various concepts such as searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, and data structures like linked lists and trees. The repository encourages contributions from the community to improve and expand the library, making it a comprehensive resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to deepen their understanding of algorithms and data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

I've written back ends for all three serialization formats used by Second Life.[1] 
(There's a binary form, an XML form, and something called "notation".)
But other than for compatibility with existing code, there's no reason to use them.[1] https://github.com/John-Nagle/serde-llsd&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; human-readable&gt; sytacticly similar to RustChoose one.I kid, I kid, but Rust is not the easiest-reading language out there. It has the same problem as C++, with a syntax that's not terribly straightforward to begin with, but then it's just liberally sprinkled with nearly every bit of punctuation that can by typed with the US QWERTY layout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like there’s three different ways that JSON objects are represented in KEON.It might be more concise, e.g., in the Newtype case, but the sacrifice seems to be quite a bit more cognitive complexity, which I would personally value over conciseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42667080</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the themes and nuances of the song "Talk Dirty to Me" by the band Poison, highlighting its blend of pop and rock elements. It analyzes the lyrics, which focus on themes of desire and physical attraction, and emphasizes the catchy, upbeat nature of the music that captures the essence of the glam metal genre popularized in the late '80s.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;With ~2/3 (and growing) of Earth’s land area being arid, you’d expect there to be a lot more interest in reverse-desertification. It’s pretty well established by now that it’s almost entirely a labor allocation issue given that there’s success stories all over the world [1] (including in the US [2]) to just create earthworks that slow and divert water. Water seems to be the biggest single issue and so many deserts actually get enough of it during flash floods. With how much Elon is interested in terraforming Mars why not just start here?[1] https://youtu.be/UAmai36XJDk?list=PLoU8oWWwU-06BGLH5y7AMbybv...
[2] https://youtu.be/3JyEHdJS94s?list=PLoU8oWWwU-06BGLH5y7AMbybv...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amending with biochar is a very good way to jump start the soil life, but regenerative agriculture should go much further than that. There's a bunch of techniques developed in the last few decades, notably permaculture and syntropic agroforestry, as well as techniques for preventing erosion in difficult topography such as keyline planting and scales.But for the soil to be really alive, lots of plants must be planted, in a polyculture context. It's the photosynthesis that feeds the soil's fauna, which then support the plants,  increase fertility and carbon content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I actually do some of this but I'm planning on doing a bit more that I'd like to get their feedback on. For background, I live in the PNW among the trees. My soil is part of a long dead riverbed and thus is mainly silt and sand. I have chickens, a worm bin, and a medium sized compost pile. The trees have the same erosive properties that trees in the Boreal forest have. Douglas firs have shallow roots but are towering trees, the soil just doesn't do them any favors.I'm building a chicken coop that's designed to take pine shavings and be completely emptied once a month with relative ease. The idea is to take the chicken poop and pine shavings and add them to the compost pile. I'll further introduce new worms from my separate vermiculture bin and add them to the compost. This should speed up the break down, but the pile will primarily rely on the Berkeley method to accomplish faster cycles. Each month I should start getting pounds of fresh compost that I can move around my yard.Secondarily to my chicken and worm hobby I love to smoke meat and cheese. I use all of the ash from the pellets to amend the soil as well. I pile it up in a box and spread it around when it gets full. I then till the soil, working it in over time. The natural acidity of the soil from the fir needles has slowly started regressing, but that's the most progress I've gotten thus far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:10:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710622</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decision of the Keygen team to eliminate phone calls as a means of customer support. They argue that calls can be unproductive and often lead to misunderstandings, advocating instead for written communication methods like email and chat. This approach not only allows for clearer documentation and quicker responses but also enables the support team to manage inquiries more effectively. The article emphasizes that this change is aimed at enhancing both customer satisfaction and the team's efficiency in addressing issues efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a CTO who makes purchasing decisions.  There are numerous products I likely would have purchased, but I either find a substitute or just go without because I won't play the stupid "let's get on a call" game.If your website doesn't give me enough information to:1.  Know enough about your product to know that it will (generally speaking) meet my needs/requirements.2.  Know that the pricing is within the ballpark of reasonable given what your product does.Then I will move on (unless I'm really desparate, which I assure you is rarely the case).  I've rolled-my-own solution more than once as well when there were no other good competitors.That's not to say that calls never work or don't have a place, because they definitely do.  The key to using the call successfully (with me at least) is to use the call to get into true details about my needs, after I know that you're at least in the ballpark.  Additionally, the call should be done efficiently.  We don't need a 15 minute introduction and overview about you.  We don't need a bunch of small talk about weather or sports.  2 minutes of that is ok, or when waiting for additional people to join the call, but beyond that I have things to do.I know what my needs are.  I understand you need some context on my company and needs in order to push useful information forward, and I also understand that many potential customers will not take the lead in asking questions and providing that context, but the sooner you take the temperature and adjust, the better.  Also, you can get pretty far as a salesperson if you just spend 5 minutes looking at our website before the call!  Then you don't have to ask basic questions about what we do.  If you're willing to invest in the time to get on a call, then it's worth a few minutes of time before-hand to look at our website.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This only works if your sales strategy is all about inbound sales, i.e. content marketing (like this article)/ads.But if you're an enterprise b2b company and want to grow quickly rather than taking 8 years to go beyond 1 solopreneur like this guy you're going to want to do outbound sales.It's also worth noting that this guys is mostly doing small deals. The literal largest price he has on his pricing page is 72k/yr, which isn't tiny, but his typical deal size is likely much smaller, so it makes total sense for him not to get on a call for $49/month, because that is not a scalable strategy.But many enterprise b2b companies have a more complicated product than Keygen and charge orders of magnitude more than they do.Which is not to say that he is wrong, it's just that this is the correct strategy for scaling a low ACV product, rather than a high ACV product. And a low ACV product has to have much broader demand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In most of these discussions, people on the sales side claim, "but our customers WANT this! Trust us!" and most of the people on the buying side scream, "We hate this. Please let us buy it without this song and dance."
It's a shocking disconnect to me.
(For what it's worth, I'm squarely on the fouder/engineering buying side and hate the call song and dance, and only engage in it as a last resort.)Parting thought: SpaceX tells you how much it costs to ship something INTO SPACE. I bet you can figure out a way to tell me your SaaS price, in ballpark terms, and what it depends upon...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:02:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725385</guid></item><item><title>2.

Virtually every day was the same. Very clear. Very still.I’m not sure if anyone could ever “get” one of his movies completely beyond the experience and the narrative. He always left so much unsaid and open to interpretation, just like life. They are movies designed to make the viewer feel a certain way, rather than literally what’s in the screen.

&lt;p&gt;The website expresses gratitude towards various individuals and groups who have supported Hindenburg Research in its efforts to promote transparency and accountability in the financial markets. It highlights the importance of collaboration and the collective fight against corporate fraud and manipulation. There is a recognition of the role that whistleblowers, advocates, and the broader community play in holding companies accountable, ultimately contributing to a healthier financial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've ironically lost more money the more closely I've paid attention to my investments because I was naively confident in the market's ability (or as I've come to suspect, willingness) to react to evidence of fraud.The amount of deceit put out into the world and gobbled up, on purpose, in business is obscene and seriously depressing. The magnitude of damage to psyches and thus economies that anyone acting in a fraudulent manner in finance creates is far-reaching and immeasurable. Punishment for financial crimes should be calculated based on the average lifetime earnings of a citizen -- if your victims are folks earning at or below the average wage, and you've scammed 100 lifetimes worth of average earnings, it's as if you've murdered 100 people.Hindenburg's reports were a true pleasure to read, and their track record proves their positive contribution to society. Many self-important people online are quick to pounce on short sellers as being evil, and that will forever be a serious red flag to me thanks in no small part to Nate Anderson and the folks at Hindenburg Research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"just feeling like it" seems insufficient explanation for dismantling a successful organization rather than transitioning itthey just completed their "pipeline of ideas" with "the last Ponzi cases" - seems like a surprisingly clean and abrupt end for an investigative organizationthe team members are "brilliant" and "family to me" but heis  disbanding rather than transitioning leadershipHe mentions some team members are starting their own research firm but he "will have no personal involvement" That emphasis seems noteworthyClaims there's "no particular threat" but takes pains to emphasize this multiple timesinstead of maintaining the organization and training successors directly, he's planning to release videos and materials about their methodsNo mention of the firm's financial position or client relationshipsNot buying it, there's a story but it doesnt seem like he wants to tell it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ll always remember them for exposing the Nikola motors fraud: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24436721&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717234</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to abandon social media algorithms in favor of using RSS feeds for content consumption. It emphasizes the benefits of RSS, such as increased control over the content one engages with and reduced exposure to negative influences of algorithm-driven platforms. The author argues that RSS fosters a more intentional and curated online experience, allowing users to connect with the content and creators they genuinely appreciate, rather than being dictated by algorithms that prioritize engagement over relevance. Overall, the piece encourages readers to consider the switch to RSS for a more personalized and fulfilling way to consume information online.&lt;/p&gt;

You can can create an RSS feed from Reddit.You can't to my best knowledge create an RSS feed anymore from TwitterNewsletter to RSS: https://kill-the-newsletter.com/More stuff:Blogs &amp; RSS

https://code.rosaelefanten.org/rssparser.lisp/dir?ci=tipThis one you have to pay. I am considering it. Some RSS feeds don't work on my TinyTinyRSS. I think cloudflare, like always, is killing it:https://politepol.com/en/pricesPS: If you have an idea for a RSS reader domain, please suggest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good algorithm is a good thing. However what a good algorithm is for me is often different from what it is for those who maintain them. Outrage gets attention and sometimes it is needed, but there is a level of too much, and also a lot of outrage unfairly represents the issues and so it makes me mad even though if I understood the details I wouldn't be mad just concerned.I want an algorithm that surfaces things of interest to me, then says "you have seen it all, go outside" (with an option of if I'm confined to a hospital bed to go on).  Algorithm maintainers want me to keep scrolling for more ad dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a big proponent of RSS, but I think that it suffers from a lack of imagination these days, for example, the "quality filter" approach mentioned in this article is not very useful imo.The biggest cost of RSS feed items as a consumer is figuring out whether something is worth reading. A lot of feeds these days don't provide anything useful in the body to make a determination on this, and others just dump the entire contents in the body, which means you're wasting a bunch of time reading N% of something until you realize you're not interested in it and it can be skipped.In addition to this, RSS feeds tend to be structured to just throw everything at you, regardless of the topics you are interested in.For a few years I have been publishing my own topic-specific feeds[1] for others to consume where I fill the body with my own personal highlights from the source, with a link through to the source (ie. the things I found interesting, the "hooks" that give a quick signal to a consumer if this might be something they want to invest time in reading). They have a couple of die-hard consumers, but ultimately this really a case of a niche within a niche.I wish there were more feeds like this for me as a consumer, but unfortunately I get the feeling that this idea will never really become popular enough to catch on widely as RSS becomes less and less relevant to the mainstream.[1]: my software development topic RSS feed for example: https://notado.app/feeds/jado/software-development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724284</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Nepenthes, a sophisticated honeypot framework designed for capturing and analyzing malware and intrusions. It highlights its features, including modularity, the capability to emulate various operating systems, and support for multiple network protocols. The framework enables researchers and security professionals to create deceptive environments to attract malicious actors, allowing them to monitor and study cyber threats effectively. Additionally, the site provides information on installation, configuration, and operational use, emphasizing its role in enhancing cybersecurity research and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haha, this would be an amazing way to test the ChatGPT crawler reflective DDOS vulnerability [1] I published last week.Basically a single HTTP Request to ChatGPT API can trigger 5000 HTTP requests by ChatGPT crawler to a website.The vulnerability is/was thoroughly ignored by OpenAI/Microsoft/BugCrowd but I really wonder what would happen when ChatGPT crawler interacts with this tarpit several times per second. As ChatGPT crawler is using various Azure IP ranges I actually think the tarpit would crash first.The vulnerability reporting experience with OpenAI / BugCrowd was really horrific. It's always difficult to get attention for DOS/DDOS vulnerabilities and companies always act like they are not a problem. But if their system goes dark and the CEO calls then suddenly they accept it as a security vulnerability.I spent a week trying to reach OpenAI/Microsoft to get this fixed, but I gave up and just published the writeup.I don't recommend you to exploit this vulnerability due to legal reasons.[1] https://github.com/bf/security-advisories/blob/main/2025-01-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having first run a bot motel in I think 2005, I'm thrilled and greatly entertained to see this taking off. When I first did it, I had crawlers lost in it literally for days; and you could tell that eventually some human would come back and try to suss the wreckage. After about a year I started seeing URLs like ../this-page-does-not-exist-hahaha.html. Sure it's an arms race but just like security is generally an afterthought these days, don't think that you can't be the woodpecker which destroys civilization. The comments are great too, this one in particular reflects my personal sentiments:&gt;  the moment it becomes the basic default install ( ala adblocker in browsers for people ), it does not matter what the bigger players want to do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had our non-profit website drained out of bandwidth and site closed temporarily (!!) from our hosting deal because of Amazon bot aggressively crawling like ?page=21454 ... etc.Gladly Siteground restored our site without any repercussions as it was not our fault. Added Amazon bot into robots.txt after that one.Don't like how things are right now. Is a tarpit the solution? Or better laws? Would they stop the chinese bots? Should they even? I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725147</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see that Nintendo is treating the switch more like how they traditionally handled their mobile platforms instead of their consoles.Iterating instead of throwing out everything with each new version. There is a part of me that is going to miss the, do weird shit and see what works, Nintendo that brought us some really fun ideas. But a stable Nintendo just being able to continue putting out great games has its advantages.I am curious about the specs, but honestly don't care much. The only real issue the Switch had was being able to keep up with some of the games put on it with FPS but it still had beautiful games (like Tears of the Kingdom). So as long as it is actually a decent spec bump I am happy and have zero care to compare it to the other consoles (but I am sure people are going too and scream that it is "underpowered").The biggest thing I am curious about, will it be OLED since that will be disappointing to go back to non OLED from the OLED Switch. And Price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a lot of frustration with Switch joy-cons. Not only drift, which has claimed a number of them, but also issues with the console not recognizing when they are attached, and one pair that for some reason the switch won't recognize when trying to use in the horizontal orientation. No doubt my kids have subjected it to hard use and probably a drop or two, but still frustrating.It looks like they've added some reinforcement to the joysticks, and changed the connection with the main body to be magnetic instead of sliding in and out (which causes wear and tear on the connectors over time). I hope the Switch 2 is more robust than the original Switch.Some extra horsepower would also be appreciated. Recently we were trying to play Switch Sports with 4 players, and even my kids who are generally oblivious to graphical fidelity and framerate were complaining that it was basically unplayable in 4-player split screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't like the aesthetic as much as the Switch 1. Looks a little too sleek, too monochrome, not Nintendo-y enough. Other than the splash of color around the thumbsticks it looks like any number of those handheld Steam Deck-alikes that have been coming out.That said I always wait for the special Zelda editions of Nintendo's consoles, so I don't know that I have standing to complain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724621</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fundamentals of memory management in computer systems, emphasizing its critical role in efficiently allocating and managing memory resources for applications. It covers key concepts such as memory allocation, fragmentation, and garbage collection, along with different strategies employed for managing memory, including stack and heap allocation. The author aims to provide a clear understanding of how memory management works and its impact on system performance, along with insights into common challenges faced in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683616"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't proper usage of realloc:    lines = realloc(lines, (num_lines + 1) * sizeof(char *));

In case it cannot service the reallocation and returns NULL, it will overwrite "lines" with NULL, but the memory that "lines" referred to is still there and needs to be either freed or used.The proper way to call it would be:    tmp = realloc(lines, (num_lines + 1) * sizeof(char *));

    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(lines);
        lines = NULL;
        // ... possibly exit the program (without a memory leak)
    } else {
        lines = tmp;
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example strdup implementation:  char *strdup(const char *str) { 
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    char *retval = malloc(len);
    if (!retval) {
      return NULL; 
    }
    strcpy(retval, str);
    return retval;
  }

Has a very common defect.  The malloc call does not reserve enough space for the NUL byte required for successful use of strcpy, thus introducing heap corruption.Also, assuming a NULL pointer is bitwise equal to 0 is not portable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for such a detailed article.In my spare time working with C as a hobby I am usually in "vertical mode" which is different to how I would work (carefully) at work, which is just getting things done end-to-end as fast as possible, not careful at every step that we have no memory errors. So I am just trying to get something working end-to-end so I do not actually worry about memory management when writing C. So I let the operating system handle memory freeing. I am trying to get the algorithm working in my hobby time.And since I wrote everything in Python or Javascript initially, I am usually porting from Python to C.If I were using Rust, it would force me to be careful in the same way, due to the borrow checker.I am curious: we have reference counting and we have Profile guided optimisation.Could "reference counting" be compiled into a debug/profiled build and then detect which regions of time we free things in before or after (there is a happens before relation with dropping out of scopes that reference counting needs to run) to detect where to insert frees? (We Write timing metadata from the RC build, that encapsulates the happens before relationships)Then we could recompile with a happens-before relation file that has correlations where things should be freed to be safe.EDIT: Any discussion about those stack diagrams and alignment should include a link to this wikipedia page;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:03:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683616</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fascinating story of a 2,000-year-old wine found in a Roman tomb, delving into its historical significance, the science behind ancient winemaking, and the connection between culture and memory. It reflects on the uncanny experience of tasting such an ancient beverage, contemplating the themes of time, preservation, and the impact of history on the present. Through this narrative, the writer highlights the interplay between archaeology and sensory experiences, suggesting that ancient artifacts can evoke profound emotional and intellectual responses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article about artifacts that make the past more immediate, that allow us to connect our experiences to people hundreds or thousands of years ago.My favorite example is the writings of Onfim, who was a little boy in the 1200s in present day Russia whose scribbling and homework were exquisitely preserved on birch bark fragments. It’s so immediately recognizable as a little boy’s endearing doodles about knights and imaginary beasts, yet its 800 years old.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onfim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree these objects (just like colourised photos) help bridge the distance to the past. But I've had the same experience purely with text. If you read Cicero's letters and diaries, and then just imagine him - suffering writer's block, wracked with anxiety and self-doubt, desperate for his friends to cheer him up - as a neurotic, terminally-online Twitter user, it fits perfectly and breathes life into his every word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating! The wine discovery reminds me one scene from the book 'The Dark Forest'[0] when the protagonist drinks a wine from some centuries before... spoiler: it wasn't good.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717393</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the context of large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes the importance of TDD as an approach to improve software quality and maintainability by writing tests before code. The author explains how applying TDD principles to LLMs can enhance their reliability and performance, detailing methodologies for implementing TDD with these models. The post also explores potential challenges and considerations when adopting TDD for LLMs, ultimately advocating for its practice to foster better development outcomes in AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One trend I've noticed, framed as a logical deduction:1. Coding assistants based on o1 and Sonnet are pretty great at coding with &lt;50k context, but degrade rapidly beyond that.2. Coding agents do massively better when they have a test-driven reward signal.3. If a problem can be framed in a way that a coding agent can solve, that speeds up development at least 10x from the base case of human + assistant.4. From (1)-(3), if you can get all the necessary context into 50k tokens and measure progress via tests, you can speed up development by 10x.5. Therefore all new development should be microservices written from scratch and interacting via cleanly defined APIs.Sure enough, I see HN projects evolving in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a similar note, has anyone found themselves absolutely not trusting non-code LLM output?The code is at least testable and verifiable. For everything else I am left wondering if it's the truth or a hallucination. It incurs more mental burden that I was trying to avoid using LLM in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have yet to see an LLM + TDD essay where the author demonstrates any mastery of Test Driven Development.Is the label "TDD" being hijacked for something new? Did that already happen? Are LLMs now responsible for defining TDD?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726584</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Intel's Tofino P4 software has been made open source, offering developers greater accessibility and flexibility in network programming. This initiative enables users to build and customize network applications using the Tofino programmable switch architecture.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with most of the other comments here, and it sounds like Shopify made sound tradeoffs for their business. I'm sure the people who use Shopify's apps are able to accomplish the tasks they need to.But as a user of computers and occasional native mobile app developer, hearing "&lt;500ms screen load times" stated as a win is very disappointing. Having your app burn battery for half a second doing absolutely nothing is bad UX. That kind of latency does have a meaningful effect on productivity for a heavy user.Besides that, having done a serious evaluation of whether to migrate a pair of native apps supported by multi-person engineering teams to RN, I think this is a very level-headed take on how to make such a migration work in practice. If you're going to take this path, this is the way to do it. I just hope that people choose targets closer to 100ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the section on the importance of native devs and how they're staffing mobile was really interesting:"Native devs are crucialMobile engineers who specialize in iOS and Android are essential to building great mobile apps. There is no replacing experience and taste that comes from having built many mobile products and deeply understanding conventions and usability. Being able to drop down to the platform layer, write bindings, master build &amp; release, distribution, etc requires native expertise.They also play a vital role in optimizing app performance across the myriad of device models, ensuring a consistent user experience for all users. Additionally, native expertise is essential for managing React Native version updates, as well as adopting new features, APIs, and tooling changes that accompany new iOS and Android releases. You can't build a good product without these experts.We invested in training our native mobile developers in React Native through a self-serve course that covered everything they needed to know to ship production-ready code. Additionally, we set up office hours with developers who were already proficient in React Native to provide support through Q&amp;A sessions, pair programming, and code reviews.We also supplemented our mobile teams with some web developers for their Javascript, Typescript, and React expertise. This ensured we had strong expertise in both native and React Native, and over time, it levelled up the entire team.Having a good mix of native and web developers is the key to building great mobile apps using React Native in our experience. "&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that there was no mention of Expo. In the past, I would say bare-metal is better than Expo-managed React Native projects because of the limitations when it came to native modules. Fast forward to today, and anything you can do in a bare metal RN app can be done with Expo.The biggest game-changer recently is Expo's Continuous Native Generation[0]. You can configure all of your native modules and ios/android files with a simple config file (which has its limits, whereby you'll need to write an Expo Config Plugin[1]). You will no longer commit the ios/android native code to your repository, and instead let it be procedurally built.This resolved a lot of environment issues developers would often run into, and greatly simplified onboarding new devs. You can build your iOS/Android apps through the CI with ease. And you'll no longer be afraid of upgrading React Native, as Expo will handle all of the breaking changes in the native code for you.My guess is that Shopify started with bare metal React Native apps (which I would have done the same 5 years ago), and now migrating back to Expo-managed projects is nontrivial. At my work we only manage one app, and it was well worth migrating back.[0] https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/[1] https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690114</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have discovered a new method for arranging spheres in a way that enhances the understanding of how they can "kiss" or touch each other. The research uncovers novel configurations of spheres, revealing complex mathematical structures and relationships that challenge existing theories of sphere packing. This finding not only deepens insight into geometric and topological properties but also has potential implications in various fields such as physics and materials science, emphasizing the intricate patterns and behaviors of spatial arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd really love to know what the mathematicians are actually doing when they work this stuff out? Is it all on computers now? Can they somehow visualize 24-dimensional-sphere-packings in their minds? Are they maybe rigorously checking results of a 'test function' that tells them they found a correct/optimal packing? I would love to know more about what the day-to-day work involved in this type of research actually would be!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The interesting ta for me:&gt; Had she been one of his graduate students, he would have tried harder to convince her to work on something else. “If they work on something hopeless, it’ll be bad for their career,” he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's strange the article doesn't even mention just trying to simulate the problem computationally.Surely it's not too difficult to repeatedly place spheres around a central sphere in 17 dimensions, maximizing how many kiss for each new sphere added, until you get a number for how many fit? And add some randomness to the choices to get a range of answers Monte Carlo-style, to then get some idea of the lower bound? [Edit: I meant upper bound, whoops.]Obviously ideally you want to discover a mathematically regular approach if you can. But surely computation must also play a role here in narrowing down reasonable bounds for the problem?And computation will of course be essential if the answer turns out to be chaotic for certain numbers of dimensions, if the optimal solution is just a jumble without any kind of symmetry at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42723406</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time I see stuff like this it makes me think about optical design software.There are applications (Zemax, for example) that are used to design optical systems (lens arrangements for cameras, etc). These applications are eye-wateringly expensive-- like similar in pricing to top-class EDA software licenses.With the abundance GPU's and modern UI's, I wonder how much work would be involved for someone to make optical design software that blows away the old tools. It would be ray-tracing, but with interesting complications like accounting for polarization, diffraction, scattering, fluorescence, media effects beyond refraction like like birefringence and stuff like Kerr and Pockels, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this book so much. The literate programming style I think inspired from Knuth's cweb, great writing, beautiful high-quality physical book worth buying but also free access to knowledge. The literate-programming style means you are almost immediately applying theory to a practical system, I keep having to take breaks to learn outside math/physics though, but it is self-contained in principle I think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This and https://hint.userweb.mwn.de/understanding_mp3/index.html are both amazingly fun examples of literate programming that I recommend all of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:04:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683731</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comments here are focused on how much energy it would take to turn this into fuel. The real story here is decentralized fertilizer production, buried at the end of the article:&gt; this innovation could fundamentally reshape fertilizer manufacturing by providing a more sustainable, cost-effective alternative to centralized productionThe high energy cost of Haber-Bosch, plus the additional cost of transportation from manufacturer to farmer could potentially be eliminated by distributed, passive fertilizer generators scattered around in the fields.I'm no expert, but assuming sufficient local production, low concentration could potentially be overcome by continuous fertilization with irrigation throughout the growing season.Let's find out. Some quick fiddling with a molarity calculator and an almanac:-- 100 uM ammonia -&gt; 1.7 mg / L ammonia-- 82% nitrogen -&gt; 1.4 mg / L nitrogen-- My lawn needs around 1 lb / 1000 sq ft, or around 5 g / m2-- So my lawn needs about 3500 L / m2 of fertilized irrigation total for the season-- Ballpark farming irrigation is around 0.2 inches per day, or around 5L/m2I would need to water my lawn about 700 days in the year, or more realistically up my irrigation rate by about a factor of 4, AND source all of the water from the fertilizer box.I'm a little skeptical that I can allocate space for enough production and still have a lawn left to fertilize. The tech probably isn't ready for the big time on an industrial farm yet, but for research demo, this seems like a promising direction! Much more than concentrating it for fuel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions "Traditional methods for ammonia production require high temperatures and pressures" in reference to the existing Haber-Bosch process for producing NH3 from thin air, an interesting historic story on its own.https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/turning-air-into-breadhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73464/the-alchemy-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are these really catalysts in the traditional definition of the word? Meaning that the catalyst is non-sacrificial? This appears to be suggesting that nitration can be done with atomospheric N2 simply with the right catalyst. But N2 is triple bonded, and the lowest theoretical threshold to react N2 with anything is by breaking at least one of those bonds, which is incredibly energy intensive even under theoretically optimal conditions.Some of the most promising research in replacing Haber-Bosch is actually plasma-assisted nitration, which is basically just as energy intensive as Haber-Bosch, but with drastically lower capital requirements...something that could be done in your backyard. I struggle to see how an ATP catalyst-only method could even do anything close to breaking an N2 triple bond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725823</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some changes I would make:1. Always use `git switch` instead of `git checkout`2. Avoid `reset --hard` at all costs. So for the "accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch" issue, I would do this instead:    # create a new branch from the current state of master
    git branch some-new-branch-name
    # switch to the previous commit
    git switch -d HEAD~
    # overwrite master branch to that commit instead
    git switch -C master
    # switch to the work branch you created
    git switch some-new-branch-name
    # your commit lives in this branch now :)

3. I'd apply the same to the `cherry-pick` version of "accidentally committed to the wrong branch":    git switch name-of-the-correct-branch
    # grab the last commit to master
    git cherry-pick master
    # delete it from master
    git switch -d master~
    git switch -C master

4. And also to the "git-approved" way for "Fuck this noise, I give up.":    # get the lastest state of origin
    git fetch origin
    # reset tracked files
    git restore -WS .
    # delete untracked files and directories
    git clean -d --force
    # reset master to remote version
    git switch -d origin/master
    git switch -C master
    # repeat for each borked branch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should start recommending UIs as the default way to learn  Git. It would solve a third of these problems and another third wouldn't even come up.If you later decide that the CLI is faster, go ahead. But first, people need to see visually how they can interact with the tree.I like fork.dev, but most clients are pretty similar at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe I have a good mental model of what git does, but I never remember commands' arguments to use when they are moderately complex. I mean that the commands are not discoverable or easy to memorize.I don't know if that's because the text UI is bad, or because it's simply difficult to explain with text what to do to manipulate a tree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728916</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of interest and relevance: This past semester, Andy Pavlo's DB seminar at CMU explored a number of projects under the heading 'Database Building Blocks', starting with  DataFusion and several of its applications.  Take a listen!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjZc2AdXq_Lc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a cambrian explosion in data processing engines: DataFusion, Polars, DuckDB, Feldera, Pathway, and more than i can remember.It reminds of 15 years ago where there was JDBC/ODBC for data. Then when data volumes increased, specialized databases became viable - graph, document, json, key-value, etc.I don't see SQL and Spark hammers keeping their ETL monopolies for much longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like I'm not the target audience for this. When I have large data, then I directly write SQL queries and run them against the database. It's impossible to improve performance when you have to go out to the DB anyway; might as well have it run the query too. Certainly the server ops and db admins have loads more money to spend on making the DB fast compared with my anti-virus laden corporate laptop.When I have small data that fits on my laptop, Pandas is good enough.Maybe 10% of the time I have stuff that's annoyingly slow to run with Pandas; then I might choose a different library, but needing this is rare. Even then, of that 10% you can solve 9% of that by dropping down to numpy and picking a better algorithm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675804</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Blue Origin successfully achieved orbital flight with its New Glenn rocket for the first time, marking a significant milestone for the company. The rocket, named after the famed science fiction author Jules Verne, is designed to carry large payloads to space and aims to compete in the growing commercial launch market. The launch demonstrated advanced technology and capabilities, paving the way for future missions and establishing Blue Origin as a serious player in the aerospace industry. The success of this launch could lead to increased opportunities for both commercial and governmental satellite projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty unusual for a new space company to make orbit on their first launch.  Generally par for the course in established companies is 2 failures in the first 10 launches so lets see how they do.The stage didn't land successfully but I'd have been very surprised if they got that on the first try.NG's launch price is supposedly only about 50% higher than a Falcon 9 with a lot more payload weight and volume.  Hopefully this will result in SpaceX cutting their price, they've got a lot of room to do so before hitting their launch costs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish the cameras used film like NASA did for Saturn V. The digital cameras used on these launches basically show a white blob with no detail due to digital cameras having such low dynamic range compared to film. And this is made worse with the night launches that Blue Origin are doing.In Saturn V launches you could see see detail in the bright flame structures along with background detail.Maybe some of the upcoming digital cameras chips will have higher dynamic range eventually. I know Nikon has a paper talking about stacked sensors that are trading off high frame rate for high dynamic range: https://youtu.be/jcc1CvqCTeU?si=DuIu4BK48iZTlyB2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a pretty hardcore SpaceX fan but hats off to the BlueOrigin team. Orbit on the first try is no small feat. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42722756</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reuploaded the PDF here - https://nokia-apple-iphone-was-launched-presentation.tiiny.s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was there as this played out. Nokia had a lot of good software and software engineers but not the management structure to do anything good with that.Nokia was huge as an organization and parts of that organization recognized the threat early on. The problem was at the board and executive level. These people had a blind spot for software. They thought they were still in the electronics business. Lots of people with an electronics and radio background. Not a lot of people with software competence. And they had bought into the notion that Symbian was going to magically fix all their problems.A lot of effort was spent on looking for other solutions. And one of the things that was good (Linux) around 2005 was actually quite close to displacing Symbian as the key future proof replacement for their legacy platforms. Symbian was just rolling out for a few years and they had made a big investment in that. And management (those same people with a huge blind spot for software) backed the wrong horse.Linux never really died in Nokia but it wasn't allowed to prosper either. Devices were cancelled or repurposed for Symbian. This happened to the N8, for example. By the time they switched to windows phone, they actually had two Linux platforms (Meego and Meltemi) and an Android phone in the works as well. Meego had one last product phone launch and the team and platform were killed in the same week. Any devices for that platform were labeled as developer phones. Nokia never marketed them as a consumer phone. Meltemi never saw any product launch at all; it was aimed at feature phones. Both were good ideas but poorly executed. Nokia killed them along with Symbian in order to back windows phone. Classic baby and bathwater situation.And MS ended up killing the one Nokia Android phone that was launched shortly before they acquired the whole phone division. Kind of a desperate/ballsy move. I suspect Nokia did this as a stick to ensure MS followed through with the acquisition. That was their "oh we could just switch from windows phone to Android unless.. " move. Nokia was at point the only OEM that still believed in Windows Phone.MS killed the whole division shortly after Satya Nadella took over and was sorting out the mess left by Steve Ballmer. The iphone was solidly in charge by then and the rest of the market was Android. Courtesy of lots of Linux contributions by the Meego and Maemo team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was at Palm when the iPhone launched, and one note from this analysis summed up Apple's new power in the market and how they really changed the landscape."Cingular has allowed Apple to launch a device with WLAN and inbuilt services"At that time, the carriers controlled so much of the cell phone experience. We certainly would have loved to have launched Palm Treo phones with WiFi radios, but our carrier partners wanted the only way to get data in and out of the devices to be through their monetized data plans.  They also wanted to control what you did with that data so they could charge for their own email or messaging systems or web portals.  The same applied to app stores.  Palm OS didn't have a unified app store at that time, just sideloading and some third-party methods, and some carriers had started making their own stores where you could buy apps billed through your cell phone bill.  They hated the idea of a platform owning that, and I expect that was part of the reason Apple originally released it with no app store.  They needed the phone to be a massive hit in order to gain the power to also bypass that wall that the cell companies put up.Palm did benefit from the iPhone launch -- it had us uplevel our efforts away from the post-Palm OS phones that we were in the middle of developing that were aimed at the RIM market and instead try something radical with webOS, and when the Pre launched, it actually had WiFi on board, although the Sprint-exclusive Pixi phone lacked WiFi due to carrier request.  There was some momentum there for a while, but then HP bought us, hit its own set of brick walls with carriers, and ditched the hardware business shortly after Apple started launching on other carriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724761</guid></item><item><title>20.

The introduction says that they train on 37 million real and synthetic images. Are astronauts riding horses now represented in the training data more than would have been possible 5 years ago?If it's possible to get good, generalizable results from such (relatively) small data sets, I'd like to see what this approach can do if trained exclusively on non-synthetic permissively licensed inputs. It might be possible to make a good "free of any possible future legal challenges" image generator just from public domain content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The estimated training time for the end-to-end model on an 8×H100 machine is 2.6 days.That's a $250,000 machine for the micro budget. Or if you don't want to do it locally ~$2,000 to do it on someone else's machine for the one model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:05:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681793</guid></item><item><title>21.

There's no way to tell what's clickable.At first I just clicked on the guy in the cage which sent me to the 2D website and I thought that was it. I didn't realize that you can scroll down to see other stuff until much later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know it is going to be good when the laptop turbines start whistling as soon as you click a link ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also built a 3D portfolio website[1] using React and react-three-fiber but I took a different approach design-wise, the HTML content is scrollable like a normal website but the 3D scene subtly matches the perspective of the screen as you scroll.[1] - https://samuelgoodell.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677728</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The Nokia Design Archive, hosted by Aalto University, serves as a comprehensive resource documenting the design history of Nokia, particularly its mobile devices. The archive showcases a wide range of design artifacts, concepts, and documentation that reflect the innovative approach Nokia has taken in product design over the decades. It aims to preserve and present the legacy of Nokia's design philosophy, illustrating the intersection of technology, aesthetics, and user experience. Additionally, the platform is intended for researchers, designers, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the evolution of design practices within the telecommunications industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a mess. The graph nodes slowly crawl around, as if to ensure that when you click you won't hit the thing you meant. Feels like something built in Flash during Nokia's heady days. (Unintentional irony? Nokia was known as a company with lots of Flash concepts and little software product execution.)But the content seems really interesting. These are internal prototypes and documents from Nokia's archive, now released for the first time. I wish there was a way to browse them in chronological order without all this janky graph visualization nonsense.There's a link in the corner that takes you to the actual archive repository:https://repo.aalto.fi/index.php?name=SO_b66a9391-dcf8-4399-8...This seems like it might be a less brain-melting way to browse the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a mess of a webpage. Probably there is interesting content there but the presentation made me close it down immediatley.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UI for this does seem a bit "Baby's first force-directed graph". It's quite hard to use for navigation - if it sprang to life on load but then stayed static (other than hover highlighting) I think that would be much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42721915</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reasons why some digital services provided by the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) experience outages during nighttime hours. It highlights the challenges related to system maintenance and updates that are often scheduled during off-peak periods to minimize user disruption. The piece emphasizes the importance of these maintenance activities for improving service reliability but acknowledges the inconvenience it may cause to users seeking access to DVLA services at night. Overall, it sheds light on the balance between operational efficiency and user accessibility for government digital services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent bit of pragmatism and as a user of this service I’m happy with the trade off.People wondering why it’s not a simple switch and “there must be something else going on here” have clearly never worked with layers of legacy systems where the data actually matters. Sure it’s fixable and it’s a shame it hasn’t been but don’t assume there aren’t very good reasons why it’s not a quick fix.The gov.uk team have moved mountains over the past decade, members of it have earned the right to be believed when they say “it’s not simple”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something is missing here, why do batch jobs take 13 hours? If this thing was started on an old mainframe why isn't the downtime just 5 minutes at 3:39 AM?Exactly how much data is getting processed?Edit: Why does rebuilding take a decade or more? This is not a complex system. It doesn't need to solve any novel engineering challenges to operate efficiently. Article does not give much insight into why this particular task couldn't be fixed in 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often ran into this when using DVLA services and spluttered with indignation. But at the end of the day, these services are fantastically usable (during the daytime) and I appreciate Dafydd pushing to just get them out there!I got my license in 2015 so never in my life have I had the apparently ubiquitous American experience of queuing at the DMV and filling in paper forms. (is this still real? or limited to stand-up comedy?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676545</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel framework for the analysis of social networks, focusing on the dynamics of opinion formation in groups. It presents a mathematical model to understand how individuals' opinions evolve based on their social interactions and the influence of peer pressure. The study highlights key factors that affect consensus and polarization within networks, providing insights into the mechanisms that drive collective behaviors in social settings. The findings have implications for various fields, including sociology, political science, and information technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So Minimax just "open-sourced" (I add it in "" because they have a custom license for its use and I've not read through that) but they have context length of 4-million tokens and it scored 100% on the needle in a haystack problem. It uses lightning attention - so still attention, just a variation? So this is potentially not as groundbreaking as the publishers of the paper hoped or am I missing something fundamental here? Can this scale better? Does it train more efficiently? The test-time inference is amazing - is that what sets this apart and not necessarily the long context capability? Will it hallucinate a lot less because it stores long-term memory more efficiently and thus won't make up facts but rather use what it has remembered in context?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;similar to RWKV7’s new (sub quadratic) attention mechanism which models key values as v≈kS’ and does an in-context descent on ||v - kS’||^2/2 (where the state matrix S is one attentional head) , explained more by the author here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/main/RWKV-...and i tried to unpack it a bit here https://wdmn.fr/rank-1-take-on-rwkv7s-in-context-learning/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the title I thought this was talking about cramming the night before an exam. ;-) Or if it’s an open book exam learning during the exam as one goes through the textbook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:06:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718166</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN! I'm the developer at Jamsocket who made this. In case you're not familiar with Yjs, it's a CRDT library for building collaborative and local-first apps.The thing is, if you're not used to working with distributed state there's definitely a learning curve. Even simple things like incrementing a counter — the "hello world" of JavaScript framework demos — get tricky when dealing with multiple clients. Worse, a lot of tutorials are just like "install this library and text editor integration and boom you have an app", which doesn't give you a good mental model for what's actually happening.So we made Learn Yjs! It's an interactive Yjs tutorial. I wanted it to be really intuitive for people just getting their feet wet with local-first development, so there are lots of explorable demos and coding exercises. The idea is to use interactive examples to build an understanding from the ground up.Hope you like it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yjs is nice. Easy to get p2p results.Yjs backend, its persistence, eventual conflict resolution (one of editors stayed too long offline), history rewind seems like a tough engineering challenge to crack.Always wanted to have a nice experience with block editor like Platejs https://platejs.org/There are nice attempts simplify dev experience with solutions like Liveblocks https://liveblocks.io/text-editor However most options come at the expense of controlling your data.CRDT keyword search on HN bring consistently good results and interest in the topic, but no good options on open source backend side. Checked it many times in the past. Please correct me if I missed something.https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=tru...Most people expectations it should work at least as in Google Docs or Notion, and on the dev side it should be store privately in Postgres JSONB like format without going deep into details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The trick is a technique called fractional indexing, in which indices are fractions rather than integers.How many times you can use fractional indexing before it stops working?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731582</guid></item><item><title>28.

If you just loaded some protein with a similar MW / migration / concentration as the one you're trying to spoof, the bands would look more or less indistinguishable. And because it's a real unique band (just with the wrong protein), you wouldn't be able to tell it's been faked using visual inspection.Perhaps this is already happening, and we just don't know it... In this way I've always thought gel images were more susceptible to fraud vs. other commonly faked images (NMR / MS spectra etc, which are harder to spoof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have a playlist of 3500 videos showing images like this onehttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXXK20HE_dV8rBa2h-8P9d-0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:13 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728165</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Let's Encrypt's proposal to introduce short-lived certificates with a lifespan of just six days, along with the option for IP address certificates. This initiative aims to enhance security and privacy on the web by reducing the risks associated with long-lived certificates and enabling more flexible certificate issuance for services hosted on IP addresses. The proposal highlights the importance of making the web more secure while addressing challenges in certificate management and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kinda funny to call the current 90 day certs "long lived". When Let's Encrypted started out more than 10 years ago most certs from major vendors had a 1 year life span. Let's Encrypt was (one of) the first to use drastically shorter life spans, hence all the ACME automation effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP certs improve a niche but interesting use case for me. I run a domain registrar that implements a simple OAuth2 protocol[0] for delegating domains/subdomains. I also have an open source tunneling tool called boringproxy that implements the client side of this protocol[1].boringproxy needs to provide a callback redirect_uri to the oauth server in order to retrieve it's token, which it can then use for setting DNS records. However, it can't provide an HTTPS endpoint until it can set up those DNS records and get a cert. Chicken/egg. Currently the spec requires the server to implement a `GET /temp-domain` endpoint which creates a DNS record like 157-245-231-242.example.com which points at the client's IP. This lets boringproxy bootstrap a secure OAuth2 callback endpoint.IP certs would remove an entire step from this process.[0]: https://github.com/takingnames/namedrop-protocol-spec[1]: This is actually broken in boringproxy at the moment, but there's a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hf72-fYTts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember being surprised when Cloudflare launched https://1.1.1.1 with a valid cert and I immediately wanted one, but couldn’t find an easy way to get one.I am gonna try to run a DoH resolver on this and see how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726678</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long ago I worked on the firmware for a game controller. We started getting reports back of ghost inputs like stuck buttons and false presses after we sent some early hardware to media reviewers. Given the power of game media at the time, this was an immediate code red. We took shifts playtesting various video games for nearly a week straight just to try and replicate the issues. No luck, only the reviewers could manifest it. We were about to put reviewers on a plane to demonstrate the issue in person when I decided to clean my desk. In doing so I tossed a bare PCB running debug to the other side of the desk and my console went wild.Turns out the PCBs were shock/pressure sensitive, and the debouncing was just a bit off. Reviewers were getting really into their games and mechanically stressing the controllers. Stressed hard enough, the PCB would bend slightly, causing line level fluctuations and eventually ghost inputs. Back in the office we were just doing a job and not getting too emotionally involved in our playtesting.Some new molds and review units later we shipped the working system. Percussive debugging has solved a number of otherwise intractable bugs over my career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arguably, _The Jargon File_:http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.htmland _Zen and the Art of the Internet_https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34should be a part of the school curriculum covering the internet.While specific to the Mac, one wishes:https://folklore.org/0-index.htmlhttps://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40492.Revolution_in_T...was more widely read (and that it was updated with stories of turning OPENSTEP into Mac OS X), and if there is a similar site for Windows which collected stories such as:https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-rev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m trying to track down an old story about the network not working in a firm on Wednesday morning near 7 am.I remember the details being that only on Wednesday did they use the freight elevator to deliver donuts to an all-staff meeting and when they did, the network would fritz.It turned out that if you move a very large electromagnet (on the elevator) along the network cable, it makes the network go crazy.Combine that with cable-pullers that rather than putting holes in multiple ceilings and floors in the cable closet, saw that the elevator shaft was a pre-existing hole between floors anyway, simply took the path of least resistance and hilarity (and a real hard network debugging problem) ensues.Does anyone know when or where this anecdote occurred ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:07:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673766</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;DBOS Transact TS is a TypeScript library designed to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (dApps) by providing a simple and efficient way to handle transactions in blockchain networks. The library offers a variety of tools for managing user accounts, creating and signing transactions, and interacting with smart contracts. It aims to streamline the process for developers by abstracting complex blockchain interactions while maintaining transparency and security. Additionally, the repository includes documentation and examples to help integrate the library into projects easily.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What’s unique about DBOS’s take on durable execution (compared to, say, Temporal) is that it’s implemented in a lightweight library that’s totally backed by Postgres. All you have to do to use DBOS is “npm install” it and annotate your program with decorators. The decorators store your program’s execution state in Postgres as it runs and recover it if it crashes. There are no other dependencies you have to manage, no separate workflow server–just your program and Postgres.this is good until you the postgres server fills up with load and need to scale up/fan out work to a bunch of workers? how do you handle that?(disclosure, former temporal employee, but also no hate meant, i'm all for making more good orcehstration choices)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could you genericise the requirement in postgresql and provide a storage interface we could plug into? I think I have a use for this in Polykey (https://GitHub.com/MatrixAI/Polykey) but we use rocksdb (transactional key value embedded db).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello!

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "What Every Hacker Should Know: TLB Invalidation" provides insights into the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and its critical role in memory management during hacking and exploitation scenarios. It explains the significance of TLB invalidation in mitigating certain attacks, particularly those that involve memory access patterns. The article outlines various techniques employed by hackers to manipulate memory and emphasizes the importance of understanding TLB behavior for both defending against and executing exploits. Additionally, it highlights the implications of TLB-related vulnerabilities on system security and offers recommendations for developers and security professionals to enhance their defenses against such threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within QEMU amd64/x86 emulation (not KVM) mode, the IMUL opcode still fails its IMUL opcode emulation after an XOR opcode (also within the same TLB cached page) modified its neighbor IMUL operand(s).TLB got double-invalidated yet some say never invalidated.  The crux is a glitch within a singlr entire TLB invalidation operation thereby negating XOR opcode's ability to self-modify the neighboring IMUL operand. (Double ROT13, anyone?). I assert double-invalidation because within the same TLB invalidation stroke, XOR operation got performed ... twice, as opposed to retrieving and restoring original IMUL operand value after such invalidation thereby negating XOR computed result EITHER WAY.A failure of self-modifying code within QEMU amd64/x86 emulation mode could be a useful test to determine if one is under QEMU emulation mode, of course if the page allows read-write-execute as often found in JavaScript, Java, Python and Dalvik (Android) bytecode memory regions.Fabrice Bellard, author of QEMU, acknowledged the basic of above but failed amd64/x86 IMUL/XOR self-modify premise in emulation (not KVM) mode of QEMU.https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/364&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be interested to see this written for reading (as opposed to presenting).  Inferring the speaker's meaning from raw slides is a little challenging.  I've had to interact with the minutiae of the x86 TLB in a past life, but happily have forgotten most of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elaborate memory management (paging) systems need caching of lookups

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses OpenAI's failure to implement an opt-out system for photographers regarding the use of their images in training AI models. It highlights concerns from artists and photographers about the unauthorized use of their work and the lack of control they have over how their images are utilized by AI systems. The piece emphasizes the ongoing debate about copyright, ownership, and consent in the age of artificial intelligence, pointing out the need for clearer policies to protect creators' rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No way OpenAI will ever “good citizen” this. Tools to opt out of training sets will only come if they are legally compelled. Governments will have to make respecting some sort of training preference header on public content mandatory I think.The fact that photographers have to independently submit each piece of work they wanted excluded along with detailed descriptions just shows how much they DONT want anyone excluding content from their training data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't even understand why it's everyone elses problem to opt-out.Eventually - for how many of these AI companies would a person have to track down their opt-out processes just to protect their work from AI?  That's crazy.OpenAI should be contacting every single one and asking for permission - like everyone has to in order to use a person's work. How they are getting away with this is beyond me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s safe to assume anything Sam A says is an outright lie by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718850</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines a proposed framework for the diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across various sectors to enhance innovation and competitive advantage. It emphasizes the need for collaboration among stakeholders, including government, industry, and academia, to establish guidelines that ensure the ethical use and effective deployment of AI. The framework aims to address challenges related to AI adoption, such as data management, regulatory compliance, and workforce development, while promoting best practices and fostering a sustainable environment for AI advancements. Public comments are invited to refine and improve the framework before its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have no idea if comments actually have any impact, but here is the comment I left on the document:I am Christopher Kanan, a professor and AI researcher at the University of Rochester with over 20 years of experience in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Previously, I led AI research and development at Paige, a medical AI company, where I worked on FDA-regulated AI systems for medical imaging. Based on this experience, I would like to provide feedback on the proposed export control regulations regarding compute thresholds for AI training, particularly models requiring 10^26 computational operations.The current regulation seems misguided for several reasons. First, it assumes that scaling models automatically leads to something dangerous. This is a flawed assumption, as simply increasing model size and compute does not necessarily result in harmful capabilities. Second, the 10^26 operations threshold appears to be based on what may be required to train future large language models using today’s methods. However, future advances in algorithms and architectures could significantly reduce the computational demands for training such models. It is unlikely that AI progress will remain tied to inefficient transformer-based models trained on massive datasets. Lastly, many companies trying to scale large language models beyond systems like GPT-4 have hit diminishing returns, shifting their focus to test-time compute. This involves using more compute to "think" about responses during inference rather than in model training, and the regulation does not address this trend at all.Even if future amendments try to address test-time compute, the proposed regulation seems premature. There are too many unknowns in future AI development to justify using a fixed compute-based threshold as a reliable indicator of potential risk. Instead of focusing on compute thresholds or model sizes, policymakers should focus on regulating specific high-risk AI applications, similar to how the FDA regulates AI software as a medical device. This approach targets the actual use of AI systems rather than their development, which is more aligned with addressing real-world risks.Without careful refinement, these rules risk stifling innovation, especially for small companies and academic researchers, while leaving important developments unregulated. I urge policymakers to engage with industry and academic experts to refocus regulations on specific applications rather than broadly targeting compute usage. AI regulation must evolve with the field to remain effective and balanced.---Of course, I have no skin in the game since I barely have any compute available to me as an academic, but the proposed rules on compute just don't make any sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most salient thing in the document is that it put export controls on releasing the weights of models trained with 10^26 operations. While there may be some errors in my math, I think that corresponds to training a model with over 70,000 H100s for a month.I personally think the regulation is misguided, as it assumes we won't identify better algorithms/architectures. There is no reason to assume that the level of compute leads to these problems.Moreover, given the emphasis on test-time compute nowadays and that it seems like a lot of companies have hit a wall with performance gains with trying to scale LLMs at train-time, I especially think this regulation isn't especially meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This smells a lot like the misguided crypto export laws in the 90s that hampered browser security for years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42730126</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amino acids are common enough -- glycine has been found in comets and, controversially, even in the interstellar medium.  Other amino acids have also been found in comets.Comet organics, under pressure, can turn into amino acids in situ: https://www.llnl.gov/article/36016/amino-acids-could-be-prod...It's also presumed that cometary ice bombardment is the source of Earth's surface water, as ice or water present any earlier would have boiled off when the planet was young and hot.It's not much of a stretch to imagine that comets brought amino acids, organic compounds, and minerals to Earth as they were bringing water ice.  A lot of those aminos and organics would turn into tar, but some would be protected from UV radiation by that same tar.  With a heat source, maybe some lightning strikes, a good location, and a lot of luck, you get RNA...What we can't yet do is assign a probability or likelihood to this process.  But the ingredients should be common enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never like the emphasis on genetics and information in a lot of origin of life stuff. IMO it is too extensional; what is needed is good intensional reasoning.At the heart of chemical life is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis, this is a great intensional definition of the reproductive side. That just leaves the evolutionary side.What do "genetics" achieve for reproduction. From the autocatalysis point of view, they create a family of "nearby" autocatalytic sets: because different nucleic acid sequences reproduce in much the same way, the conditions needed to propagate one should also propogate another. This in turn makes safer mutations and....Lamarckian inheritance! If you, a microrganism get a good mutation which makes you fit, and then you split, you pass that mutation on.Genetics are sufficient for the above properties, but are they necessary? Probably not! We can probably find other things which have such a "dense/smooth mutation space" with fewer local maxima traps. Perhaps it is fine to say such things definitionally encode information, but IMO information still comes second, philosophically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The meanings of both life and intelligence have been obscured by human conceit. We simply cannot accept that we came from what is essentially a random process over eons (which makes it no less extraordinary, but imo far more understandable). The science and math of LLMs and GPTs has been around for a while, but it took time and effort (people putting stuff online plus GPUs) to finally make it usable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:08:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726539</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Ashburn, Virginia, has earned the title of the "Data Center Capital of the World" due to its strategic location, access to robust infrastructure, and a favorable regulatory environment. The area benefits from an abundance of fiber optic connectivity, reliable power sources, and proximity to major markets, making it an attractive hub for large tech companies and service providers. Additionally, with its tax incentives and a clustering of data centers, Ashburn has become a preferred site for enterprises looking to enhance their digital capabilities, further solidifying its dominance in the global data center landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

High level of security and more cages than I had ever seen before.  It was like a little town with street signs so you could find your cage.

As far as I know, if you want to build multi-arch images on native runners for each platform, you basically need to:* Configure a workflow with 1 job for each arch, each building a standalone single-arch image, tagging it with a unique tag, and pushing each to your registry* Configure another job which runs at the completion of the previous jobs that creates a combined manifest containing each image using `docker manifest create`.Basically, doing the steps listed in https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-... under "The hard way with docker manifest
".Does anyone have a better approach, or some reusable workflows/GHA that make this process simpler? I know about Depot.dev which basically abstracts the runners away and handles all of this for you, but I don't see a good way to do this yourself without GitHub offering some better abstraction for building docker images.Edit: I just noticed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42729529 which has a great example of exactly these steps (and I just realized you can just push the digests, instead of tags too, which is nice).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:23 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728015</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While thinking of making a game I’ve found these helpful:1. The Art of Game Design, A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schell - https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design2. 20 Tips on Making Games by Jordan Mechner - https://www.jordanmechner.com/downloads/library/20tips.pdf3. Liz England’s blog - https://lizengland.com/blog/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons I got into software development was that I wanted to make some games (even just small ones that I release for free).I've now been coding for like 14 years, and I still haven't done it (besides a number of prototypes). And I'm so burnt out on writing code that I never have the mental energy to push through and get one done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think putting off polish for later as the OP and multiple comments here recommend is a fallacy. There are many popular, successful games that would just not be fun if they didn't have good animations, no effects and everything was boxes. Every game that relies on "feeling good to play". It might be fine for an RPG or an RTS, but it's probably not for something like Overwatch or Doom (the new ones). Just imagine Vampire Survivors without sound or effects. Some games live off the art style alone. This is a very controversional opinion, but I think if e.g. Ori and the Blind Forest had bad art, no one would have played the game. Some games you can evaluate really well with bad art and no juice or polish, other games need some and there are even games that need a lot of it, before you know if they can be fun. It's not that simple imho. I remember working on games that were not really fun until I added some effect and suddenly it was really addicting. People like flashing lights and noises and pretty pictures. If good, unique or interesting art was irrelevant, no one would invest in it, but people do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:33 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681545</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;A new laser technology has been developed that can measure vast distances with nanometre precision, significantly improving the accuracy of distance measurements in various fields such as space exploration, earth sciences, and engineering. This technique utilizes advanced laser systems to achieve unprecedented levels of precision, enabling scientists to gain better insights into the universe and enhance the capabilities of various technologies reliant on accurate distance measurements. The innovation demonstrates potential applications in improving the functionality of satellite navigation and mapping systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05542 :&gt; two-way dual-comb ranging (TWDCR) approach&gt; The advanced long-distance ranging technology is expected to have immediate implications for space research initiatives, such as the space telescope array and the satellite gravimetry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Vast" really shouldn't have been eliminated from the title, because interferometers have been measuring distances with nanometer precision since even before there were lasers, and lasers have been used in interferometers since the first laser in 01960.  Victorian-era interferometers, commonly used for grinding telescope mirrors, could only measure distances of a few meters with precision in the hundreds of nanometers.However, laser interferometers were already quite good; LIGO, most famously, detected gravitational waves by measuring strains of around 10⁻²⁰ over a distance of 1120 km, which works out to a change in distance of less than 0.000012 nanometers, much less than the width of a proton.The news here actually seems to be that "A new way to gauge distance using lasers can measure lengths of more than 100 kilometres ... To continue reading, subscribe today with our January sale."  So, uh, I don't know, maybe the reporter wasn't familiar with LIGO and thought that nanometer-precision interferometry over kilometers was new?  Sitkack, you say there's a paper somewhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am only two pages in, but I want to say this paper is very well written. People should give reading it a try reading (with LLM assistance).If this technique could be adapted to existing optical fiber infrastructure, we could see the effects of fiber optic cable stretch and deformation in realtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:43 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42693239</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red Hat just hit us with 300% price increases for OpenShift across the board right after we went live in production after a little over a year of implementation. The entire org is very, very unhappy about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’ve been hammering us pretty hard, especially some folks in the leadership chain who worked with them before. While I have no direct beef with the product, the reality is that our Enterprise workload (and in fact, most Enterprise IT workloads in my experience) are VM-first, not container-first.My research conclusion at the time was that, while OpenShift is a great product worthy of consideration, it really only shines in organizations that are heavily invested in microservices or Kubernetes. If you (or more specifically, your vendors) haven’t migrated into that state, it’s not worth it compared to a RHEL server license and their KVM+Cockpit solution for bog standard VMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What're the FLOSS technologies underlying OpenShift? Sounds like KVM?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:09:53 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725862</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Potoo, a family of nocturnal birds found in Central and South America, known for their distinctive appearance and behavior. They have large eyes, camouflaged plumage, and a unique call, which contributes to their mysterious reputation. The Potoos are primarily insectivorous and are notable for their cryptic roosting habits, often blending in perfectly with tree branches to avoid predators. Their conservation status varies, with some species facing threats due to habitat loss. The article also highlights various aspects of their biology, ecology, and cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently, David Zucker (of Airplane! and Police Academy!^W^W Police Squad! film-making fame) bought a race horse which he named "All Pink" and instructed the jockey to run the horse as close as possible to the inside rail. The intention was to cause the announcer to say some funny words:&gt; It was 1989 through 1993. Saratoga, NY, not Sarasota Fla. The goal was to get the track announcer to call out: "...and it's All Pink on the inside!" In fact, it took three horses over about four years. The first horse, "All Pink" ran on the inside, but never got the call. "Ol Pink" ran too close to the rail, and jumped it, ending up on the infield. Finally a mare, "Awl Pink" got the call in late '93.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reopening of the investigation into the death of Suchir Balaji, which was initially ruled a suicide. New evidence and questioning have prompted authorities to treat the case as an active investigation, raising concerns over the circumstances leading to his death. The piece highlights the family's call for justice and the implications of the change in the investigation's status for those involved.&lt;/p&gt;

Doesn't appear remotely close to a suicide.Guy was hit in the head while brushing his teeth, sat in a sitting position and shot from above. Wonder how they can get to so many peeps in positions of authority. Coroner, local PD, attorneys were all compromised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polymarket odds are pretty low on this.

https://polymarket.com/event/arrest-in-the-suchir-balaji-cas...The "evidence" seems pretty weak. A second autopsy that even the family's attorney admits is inconclusive... okay. Alleged "conflicts of interest" with the medical examiner... okay.Seems very likely this guy was just depressed and his depression ended in tragedy. The motivated reasoning here from Musk, his family, and many others revolves around wanting to prove OpenAI is bad because they want OpenAI to be a bad guy they can pin this onto.Not sure what OpenAI would possibly gain from this.
