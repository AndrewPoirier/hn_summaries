&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a CSS technique for creating a dialog that consistently covers the full height of the viewport, regardless of the content inside it. It outlines the challenges posed by various CSS properties like `vh` and the behavior of flexbox in achieving this effect. The author shares practical solutions, including the use of `position: fixed` and `height: 100%`, to ensure the dialog remains responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes. Additionally, the article provides code snippets and examples to illustrate the implementation of these solutions in web design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like a good example of depending on LLMs too much. After the first bad output the next step should have been to open inspector, not to try three more LLMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah - this was arguably mostly my fault (sorry!).There's quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being surprisingly widely used.The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add "overflow:auto", and some form of "max-height"/"max-width" to ensure that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.The better solution to this was to add "max-height:stretch", "max-width:stretch".
You can see the discussion for this here:
https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r5136422...The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the "stretch" keyword. (Blink likely will "soon" - https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2n... )However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a specification - and nobody implemented it ("-webit-fill-available" would have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn't have this working the same yet).Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of "box-sizing:content-box" being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that we didn't want to touch).One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably worse not to have done anything.It may still be possible to change to the stretch variant, however likely some sites are relying on the extra "space" around dialogs now, and would be mad if we changed it again. This might still be a net-positive however given how much this confuses web-developers (future looking cost), vs. the pain (cost) of breaking existing sites.Sorry!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The spec lives in GitHub in a 7MB source file which is too large to view through the GitHub web interfaceIt's a bit offtopic, but think about it: cannot view the doc despite its size is only 7Mb ~ about 0.04 percent of a typical computer's memory (16Gb). We can open and view PDFs much bigger and search there without an issue in browser. We can view movies worth half of the memory.But it's surprisingly not possible to view a 7Mb text file in the professional tool for working with textual source code called github. Shame. And sad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article "A Princely Ploy" explores the life and strategies of the 16th-century prince Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who became a key figure in the tumultuous reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. It delves into his ambitions, the political machinations surrounding his marriage to Mary, and the subsequent power struggles in Scotland. The narrative highlights Darnley's desire for influence and status, ultimately leading to his tragic fate, while examining the broader context of royal politics and personal rivalries during that era. Through this lens, it sheds light on the interplay between ambition, love, and betrayal in the Scottish court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the influence of Toni Morrison's play "Dreaming Emmett" on her renowned novel "Beloved." It details how the themes of racial violence and memory in both works reflect Morrison's engagement with the historical trauma of black lives in America. The piece highlights key elements of the play, including its focus on the lynching of Emmett Till and its impact on Morrison's narrative style and character development in "Beloved." Overall, it emphasizes how "Dreaming Emmett" serves as a crucial piece in understanding the depth and resonance of Morrison's literary contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the impending transition from the WHOIS system to the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) by ICANN, which is set to fully take effect on January 27, 2025. This change aims to enhance data access, improve compliance with privacy regulations, and provide users with better tools for querying registration data. The article details ICANN's efforts to support stakeholders during this transition, outlines the benefits of RDAP over WHOIS, and emphasizes the importance of updating registration data practices in accordance with evolving internet standards.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was announced originally early last year.  It removes the requirement for TLD and nTLD (not ccTLD) operators to have a WHOIS service available, but doesn't mandate they must shut them down.So far the sunsetting has had little effect with most TLDs still having their WHOIS services online.  In reality, I think we'll see a period of time where many TLDs and nTLDs have both WHOIS and RDAP available.Additionally, since ccTLD's aren't governed by ICANN, many don't even have an RDAP service available.  As such, there's going to be a mix of RDAP and WHOIS in use across the entire internet for some time to come.Disclosure: I run https://viewdns.info/ and have spent many an hour dealing with both WHOIS and RDAP parsing to make sure that our service returns consistent data (via our web interface and API) regardless of the protocol in use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The concept of WHOIS has felt sleazy for many years.If I register a domain, the registrar will basically extort me a couple extra dollars per year for “domain privacy” for the privilege of not having my name, home address, phone number, and email publicly available and then mirrored across thousands of shady scraped content sites in perpetuity. Even If you don’t care about that, then begins the never ending emails texts and calls begin from sleazy outfits who want to sell you related domains, do SEO for you, revamp your site, schedule a call, or just fill your spam box up with legitimate scams and bootleg pharma trash.All because you wanted a $10/year dot com without paying the bribe.And yes I grew up leafing through well worn phone books next to corded phones. This is not comparable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RDAP replaces WHOIS, offering a more technologically advanced way to discover the domain is protected by privacy services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43384069</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of developing software with a focus on modularity and maintainability. It emphasizes the benefits of creating systems that can be easily modified and extended, which ultimately leads to improved code quality and project longevity. The author highlights best practices for achieving this, such as using clear interfaces, implementing design patterns, and facilitating collaboration among developers. The goal is to encourage software developers to prioritize these principles in their work to build robust and adaptable systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related, here's a comment from 2019 from at the time of writing from someone claiming to be a principal engineer at Amazon, talking about how"I'm proud of the approach that Amazon takes to privacy. Privacy of customer data is considered the most important thing to Amazon, and this customer obsession (the #1 leadership principle) permeates the organization."The comment further talks about the mute button on the original Amazon Echo  (i.e. Alexa voice assistant) being hardware-based : https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19208670&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People don't really care about privacy, it's as simple as that. Yes, they worry about privacy, and complain about violations of privacy. But if they cared, they never would have purchased this product in the first place. There are bits of technology which violate privacy, but are extremely difficult to fully avoid: Social Media, (I know a lot of HN isn't on it, but how about most of your family and friends?) smart phones, the surveillance of modern stores, etc. All of those are terrifically difficult to fully avoid or mitigate. But not buying an echo is effortless and free. There's no cost associated with not buying one, and not spending the time to set it up.But, despite the fact that it literally costs nothing, these have sold quite well, and if folks haven't got an echo they've got a Google Home, or a Siri, or something else. They just don't care about privacy, and companies know this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I switched to Home Assistant a couple months ago (because I didn't like the idea of my voice being sent to amazon constantly) and haven't looked back! Soo much more you can do (including immediately using an LLM, if you like, whether in the cloud or local), and so much more control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43385268</guid></item><item><title>3. GIMP 3.0</title><link>https://testing.gimp.org/news/2025/03/16/gimp-3-0-released/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;GIMP 3.0 has been officially released, introducing significant improvements and new features aimed at enhancing user experience. Key updates include a revamped user interface, better performance, and advanced features such as the new GEGL image processing library integration, which allows for non-destructive editing. This release marks a major milestone for the GIMP project, reflecting the community's efforts and contributions towards modernizing the software while maintaining its core capabilities as an open-source image manipulation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43393822"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.0 is big for GIMP. Lots of features to make it viable for simple Desktop Publishing and YouTube thumbs.Created a quick poster: https://i.imgur.com/pPgy255.png Stuff that needs work:* UI/UX:  "Tool-&gt;GEGL Operation..." is too much friction for such a common operation- just pop it up when you click on the "FX" button in the layers window.* UI/UX:  Naming. Drop shadows and glow are currently not discoverable (its squirreled away in the generic "GEGL Styles").* UI/UX: "Move Tool" should act like a common entry point to other tools if you're not dragging. Switch to "Transform Tool" if I single click an image layer. Switch to the "Text Tool" if I single click a Text layer! Please!* UI/UX: Copying/pasting layer styles does not work. Users can overlook many issues if you can duplicate/destroy layer styles easily. Preset system is cumbersome. Idea: Presets usable from the Layers window directly (could be just add/apply presets) would help a lot, but just copy/paste would probably be better.* BUG: Layers often clip GEGL Glow. Again could be worked around by just easy copy/paste of layer styles. See clipping present on "GIMP Halloween Party" text in my image.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Usually I'd strongly bias toward OSS. But gimp's ux is just so bad, I'd sooner use (_vomits_) adobe knowing I'll have to wrestle a bear in order to cancel my subscription. But there's no need. Figma, while not OSS, is free, and it does have acceptable UX. I'm a newb who occasionally needs to brush up an image or combine multiple images for my startup. I got more done in figma in thirty minutes than in gimp in 3 hours, and was much less frustrated. I could never find the relevant button (or sometimes even pane) in gimp. If you already learned gimp, use it, but for anyone else it's false economy - the time you lose fighting its UX outweighs the feelgood/freedom of using OSS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Making pro-quality text got easier, too. Style your text, apply outlines, shadows, bevels, and more, and you can still edit your text, change font and size, and even tweak the style settings.This is a game-changer. I tried to use GIMP to typeset comic translations many years ago, and the workflow was so terrible I had to resort to a few extra tools, complicating my workflow. I'll have to try the new text editing to see for sure, but it sounds like typesetting is now comparable to what's offered in proprietary editors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43393822</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the current state of HTTP/3 and QUIC protocol support within open-source communities. It highlights that while the adoption of these technologies offers benefits such as improved performance and security for web communications, many tools and libraries have yet to fully integrate or support them. The author emphasizes the need for broader adoption and implementation across platforms to realize the potential advantages of HTTP/3 and QUIC, urging developers and contributors to focus on enhancing support within existing frameworks and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43360251"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Really it's hard to point to any popular open-source tools that fully support HTTP/3: rollout has barely even started.&gt; This seems contradictory. What's going on?IT administrators and DevOps engineers such as myself typically terminate HTTP/3 connections at the load balancer, terminate SSL, then pass back HTTP 1.1 (_maybe_ 2 if the service is GRPC or GraphQL) to the backing service. This is way easier to administer and debug, and is supported by most reverse proxies. As such, there's not much need for HTTP/3 in server side languages like Golang and Python, as HTTP/1.1 is almost always available (and faster and easier to debug!) in the datacenter anyways.HTTP/3 and IPv6 are mobile centric technologies that are not well suited for the datacenter. They really shine on ephemeral spotty connections, but add a lot of overhead in a scenario where most connections between machines are static, gigabit, low-latency connections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    &gt; At the same time, neither QUIC nor HTTP/3 are included in the standard libraries of any major languages including Node.js, Go, Rust, Python or Ruby. 

.NET actually looking like it has decent support for any teams that are interested[0] (side note: sad that .NET and C# are not considered "major"...).  There is an open source C library that they've published that seems rather far along[1]Support for Windows, Linux[2], and Mac[3] (the latter two with some caveats).Overall, I think for most dev teams that are not building networking focused products/platforms, HTTP/3 is probably way down the stack of optimizations and things that they want to think about, especially if the libraries available have edge cases and are too early for production.  Who wants to debug issues with low-level protocol implementations when there are features to ship, releases to stabilize, and defects to fix?[0] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networ...[1] https://github.com/microsoft/msquic[2] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networ...[3] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, I think the biggest issue with large scale deployment of HTTP 3 is that it increases the surface area of potentially vulnerable code that needs to be kept patched and maintained. I'd far rather have the OS provide a verified safe socket layer, and a dynamically linked SSL library, that can be easily updated without any of the application layer needing to worry about security bugs in the networking layer.Additionally, I'd posit that for most client applications, a few extra ms of latency on a request isn't really a big deal. Sure, I can imagine applications that might care, but I can't think of any applications I have (as a developer or as a user) where I'd trade to have more complexity on the networking layer for potentially saving a few ms per request, or more likely just on the first request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43360251</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to delve into machine learning, one of the superb resources I have found is, Stanfords "Probability for computer scientists"(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MuDZIAzBMY&amp;list=PLoROMvodv4...).It delves into theoretical underpinnings of probability theory and ML, IMO better than any other course I have seen. (Yeah, Andrew Ng is legendary, but his course demands some mathematical familarity with linear algebra topics)And of course, for deep learning, 3b1b is great for getting some visual introduction (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQ...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed, but PAC-Bayes or other descendants of VC theory is probably not the best explanation. The notion of algorithmic stability provides a (much) more compelling explanation. See [1] (particularly Sections 11 and 12)[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10036&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who wants to demystify ML should read: The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning [0] By Josh Starmer.To this day I haven't found a teacher who could express complex ideas as clearly and concisely as Starmer does. It's written in an almost children's book like format that is very easy to read and understand. He also just published a book on NN that is just as good. Highly recommend even if you are already an expert as it will give you great ways to teach and communicate complex ideas in ML.[0]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75622146-the-statquest-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43390400</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The MVT (Mobile Verification Toolkit) project on GitHub provides a set of tools designed for the analysis and verification of mobile applications, particularly focusing on the detection of malicious behavior and privacy issues. It offers features such as static and dynamic analysis of APK files, allowing users to assess security risks and identify potential threats in mobile apps. The toolkit is aimed at researchers, security professionals, and developers who seek to enhance mobile app security and ensure that applications comply with privacy standards. The repository includes comprehensive documentation for installation and usage, as well as contributions from the community to improve its functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;iOS, https://docs.mvt.re/en/latest/ios/methodology/&gt; You will need to decide whether to attempt to jailbreak the device and obtain a full filesystem dump, or not.Since Apple won't allow iDevice owners to access an unredacted raw disk image for forensics, iOS malware detection tools are hamstrung. The inability to fully backup devices means that post-intrusion device restore is literally impossible. Only a new OS version can be installed, then a subset of the original data can be restored, then every app/service needs to re-establish trust with this newly "untrusted" (but more trustworthy than the previously trusted-but-compromised) device.In theory, Apple could provide their own malware analysis toolset, or provide optional remote attestation to verify OS and baseband integrity.In the absence of persistent disk artifacts, the next best option is behavioral analysis, e.g. usage anomalies ("dog that did not bark") in CPU, battery, storage or network. Outbound network traffic can be inspected by a router and compared against expected application and system traffic. This requires an outbound firewall where rules can specify traffic by wildcard domain names, which are widely used by CDNs. Apple helpfully provides a list of domains and port numbers for all Apple services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be curious if anyone has tried this for Android and what kind of stuff it's checking for. Sideloaded APKs can often contain malicious stuff, but it's nearly impossible to know if it's doing anything suspicious unless you open it up with a tool like Apktool [1] or run it on Triage [2] as it supports Android and watch what it's doing. Most antivirus for Android is pretty much a joke, as far as I'm concerned.[1] https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool?tab=readme-ov-file[2] https://tria.ge/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently had the "pleasure" of reading over a criminal forensic investigation report. It was harrowing. The report was basically like "we ran virus check and it reported clean so nobody could have accessed the system remotely" and then it moved right along to the next thing. The logic felt more dubious than some of the court scenes from Idiocracy. And it had been produced for defense counsel and paid for by the defendant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43384894</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods for extracting content from EPUB files that are protected using the LCP (License Control Protocol), which is designed to secure digital publications. It outlines the challenges faced due to the DRM (Digital Rights Management) restrictions and examines various technical approaches and tools that could potentially facilitate the extraction process. The author emphasizes the need for ethical considerations and compliance with legal standards when attempting to access protected content.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're looking for an opinionated task manager for yourself and your team, then I'd love for you to check it out!One thing I love about it is that it sort of takes care of sprint planning for me. No more figuring out how much I can fit into a week - it does that for me, and seeing my progress over the past few weeks motivates me to keep my momentum up.It isn't just like Pivotal tracker - will likely never be - the estimation is in hours, rather than points. I plan on explaining the thought process behind this decision soon. And it isn't built specifically for software teams - I manage personal and dev and non-dev work tasks with it.If you do try it, I'd love to hear from you (vishal@oknext.io).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been a happy redmine user for about 15 years. It may not look as flashy as newer systems but I appreciate the consistent UI which hasn’t broken, and someone is doing the hard work of making non flashy but extremely useful things like e-mail workflows, export as PDF, git integration, etc stay working&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related: "Pivotal tracker will shut down" - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41591622&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378925</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's kinda mind-blowing that we have (so-called) AI, quantum computing, 6K screens, M2 NVME, billions of networked devices, etc., but regular data *can only be expected to last about 5 years* due to the propensity of moving disk failure, SSD impermanence, bitrot, etc., and is only overcome with great attention and significant cost (continually maintaining a JBOD or RAID or NAS, or painstakingly burning to M-Disc bluray etc.) or handing it over to someone else to manage (cloud) or both.  I mean maybe you get lucky with a simple 3-2-1 but maybe you don't, and for larger archives of data that is simply not necessarily a walk in the park either.Absolutely mindblowing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've thought about the "hundreds of years" problem on and off for a while (for some yet to be determined future time capsule project), and I figure that about all we know for sure that will work is:- engraved/stamped into a material (stone tablets, Edison cylinders, shellac 78s, vinyl, voyager golden record(maybe))- paper, inked (books) or punched (cards, tape)- photography; microfiche/microfilm (GitHub Arctic Code Vault), lithography?I actually looked into what it might take to "print" an archival grade microfilm somewhat recently - there might be a couple options to send out and have one made but 99.99% of all the results are to go the other way, scanning microfilm to make digital copies. This is all at the hobbyist grade cheapness scale mind you, but it seems weird that a pencil drawing I did in 2nd grade has a better chance of lasting a few hundred years than any of my digital stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost calculations are often different at the enterprise scale from the individual scale.  Hypotheticallyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Tape-Openis an affordable storage medium if you need to store petabytes but for what the drive costshttps://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1724762-REG/quantum_t...you could buy 400 TB worth of hard drives.  Overall I'd have more confidence in the produced-in-volume hard drives compared to LTO tapes which have sometimes disappeared from the market because vendors were having patent wars.  Personally I've also had really bad experiences with tapes,  going back to my TRS-80 Color Computer which was terribly unreliable,  getting a Suntape with nothing at zeros on it, when the computer center at NMT ended my account, the "successful" recovery of a lost configuration from a tape robot in 18 hours (reconstructed it manually long before then), ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43391459</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of those make intuitive sense, except this one:&gt; MUST include a byte sequence that is invalid UTF-8Making the magic number UTF-8 (or ASCII, which would still break the rule) would effectively turn it into a "magic string". Isn't that the better method for distinguishability? It's easier to pick unique memorable strings than unique memorable numbers, and you can also read it in a hex editor.What would be the downsides?Or is the idea of the requirement to distinguish the format from plaintext files? I'd think that the version number or the rest of the format already likely contained some invalid UTF-8 to ensure that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's basically how I designed the magic bytes for the OpenTimestamps proof files:    $ hexdump -C foo.ots 
    00000000  00 4f 70 65 6e 54 69 6d  65 73 74 61 6d 70 73 00  |.OpenTimestamps.|
    00000010  00 50 72 6f 6f 66 00 bf  89 e2 e8 84 e8 92 94 01  |.Proof..........|

0) Magic is at the beginning of the file.1) Starts with a null-byte to make it clear this is binary, not text.2) Includes a human-readable part to make it easy to figure out what the file is in hex dumps.3) 8 bytes of randomly chosen bytes, all of which greater than 0x7F to ensure they're not ASCII.3) Finally, a one-byte major version number.4) Total length (including major version) is 32 bytes to fit nicely in a hex dump.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia has a good explanation why the PNG magic number is 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a. It has some good features, such as the end-of-file character for DOS and detection of line ending conversions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG#File_header&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43366671</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of exceptional Jordan algebras, which are a class of non-associative algebras that arise in the context of theoretical physics and mathematics, particularly in the study of certain symmetry operations. It delves into their properties, applications, and relevance in various mathematical frameworks, such as representation theory and quantum mechanics. The piece also highlights the significance of exceptional Jordan algebras in the context of algebraic structures and their connection to exceptional groups in Lie theory. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of this specialized area of algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project "Coq of Rust" aims to provide a formal verification framework for Rust code using the Coq proof assistant. It focuses on enabling developers to ensure the correctness and safety of Rust programs by creating a dependently-typed representation of Rust within Coq. This initiative includes tools and libraries to facilitate the translation and verification of Rust code, making it easier to integrate formal methods into Rust development and enhance the reliability of software written in this programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Even if Rust's type system prevents many mistakes, including memory errors, the code is still not immune to vulnerabilities, such as unexpected panics or wrongly implemented business rules.&gt; The way to go further is to mathematically prove that it is bug-free: this is named "formal verification" and what coq-of-rust proposes! This is the only way to ensure your code contains no bugs or vulnerabilities, even against state-level actors .I like formal verification. But I consider this a misrepresentation of what it offers. It lets you mathematically prove that your code implements a specification correctly. It doesn't prove that your specification is bug-free &amp; vulnerability-free. It doesn't prove that your specification correctly implements your business rules.Formal verification is still extremely useful. It's often much easier to use a specification language to define invariants your programming language code needs to obey than to only implement things in a programming language. To me that's a much better, more honest selling point for formal methods. You have to write more code, and in a different language, but unlike just testing you can actually prove that invariants hold for all possible inputs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am just starting out with the ironclad kernel and the gloire OS built on top of it [1,2]. From the web page:  "Ironclad is a formally verified, real-time capable, UNIX-like operating system kernel for general-purpose and embedded uses. It is written in SPARK and Ada, and is comprised of 100% free software."

I recall AdaCore working with Ferrous Systems a while back. Did anything come of it for rust? I believe one of the non-starters is rust does not have a formal standards specification like C, Common Lisp, or other PLs. It's hard to develop formal verification systems for a moving target.SPARK has formal verification tools and a legacy of high-integrity applications. The Ironclad kernel is progressing towards a substantially, formally verified kernel written in SPARK. Gloire is an OS implemented on top of Ironclad for PoC.I have sort of given up on rust, because I just don't find it enjoyable. I am working with Zig. This would be a good direction for Zig to take. Glad to see the effort here. I'll have to check it out a bit more.[1] https://ironclad.nongnu.org/[2] https://github.com/Ironclad-Project/Gloire?tab=readme-ov-fil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned recently that the Coq project was renamed Rocq https://rocq-prover.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43360633</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article doesn't say what the headline says. At all. Never in the article does it say that "our capacity for language emerged 135,000 years ago".
What the article says is that they have genomically traced our species back to around 135,000 years ago to the point where we started splitting off in different groups, and as we all have the capacity for language we must have had it at the point of split as well (before that all could be said to be in the same local group. Possible, what with those population bottlenecks and everything).There's nothing in there saying there wasn't language before, nor why it shouldn't have been present much earlier. Early enough that e.g. Neanderthals could equally well be covered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like they actually say at least 135K years ago, as that is the latest it could have happened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This appears to be an argument for terminus ante quem and useful in that sense but it ignores the possibility there is a far earlier terminus post quem when the actual language capacity emerges.I think it true(ish) that in a model strongly aligned to a single root language the point of segmentation is the last point language seen in all post-fragmented states can exist. But I don't see why that is also the first point. It's just the one we can detect genetically. There will be some subsequent genetic evidence perhaps to a specific structural change in the brain, or vocal chords, or something else, indicative of language emergence.If holographically defined families tools pre-date this time, then abstract concepts were being communicated, even if not vocally. Show-and-tell has limits and I would argue strongly suggest concepts inherent in language existed to communicate how to do the tool making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43384826</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I can give one piece of advice on cable management it's this:Get a "Cable Management Box", actually get several.Everywhere you have a power strip you should have one of these. It helps contain the mess of cords, hides it away, and prevents them from being dust/spider/hair traps you don't want to touch. Shove the extra cable inside the box so you don't have a extra wires laying about. You will absolutely love not seeing a rats nest of cables, even if it's just behind/under something.I won't link to any product because they are all the same. It's just a plastic box with 2 holes/slots on the sides and a lid. It's stupid-simple but it's worth every penny. If the box is visible I guess you could spring for the more expensive ones but I usually get a 2-3 pack for $20-30. I don't think I've ever bought the same brand twice since are all the same and I just pick the cheapest that fit my needs (size).Search for "Cable Management Box" and you'll find it.You'll probably also be interesting in "6-Inch Power Extension Cable", they are great for wall warts. You can plug multiple of these into a power strip and then hang the large heads off to the side (instead of blocking multiple ports). And all of that stays tucked away in your cable management box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't played with the 2.0 stuff, but I do have the original Underware on the underside of my desk.I don't like the core concept of routing cables through what is essentially 3d printed trunking. It's a ton of printing, and a ton of faff to install. Instead I use their cable hooks at various points along a cable run. Much quicker and easier to manage after the fact.This is probably the most useful underware thing I've printed thus far, for securely holding various PSU bricks: https://www.printables.com/model/1119354-double-clip-cable-t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will probably play around with this, looks slick.For folks looking for some other options I bought this cheap server raceway: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008VFAP. Super nice to run the cables into the slots and then let the mess be inside there. I screwed one part into the desk and the cover I cut into 4 pieces so I can remove only one piece if I need to move cords around or whatever.3d printed a few pieces for power supplies and a power strip but for the most part all cables go to the raceway. I had something similar to this original "underware" at some point but it was a pain in the ass whenever I changed cables/etc. So many extra holes in the bottom of my desk now&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43386578</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm low key afraid that this stuff is gonna get popular for .mil usage.Line of sight free space optics can be immune to many many forms of jamming. Its usage dots the sci books I've read over the years, but almost always for scary reasons.Here's the Navy today announcing work on AirBorne System for Optical Relay and Broadcast (ABSORB), a (for now) low-cost prototype one-to-many (I maybe mis-inferring what multi-access means?) relayable free space system, https://defence-blog.com/us-navy-plans-to-revolutionize-nava...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RONJA[0] with lasers?  &gt;smile&lt;Free space optics always seemed like a neat idea. For space-based communication, particularly if your "mission" involves as little stray emission as possible, I would think free space optics would be a win.I would assume there's more error correction, but otherwise I wonder how dramatically this differs from modulating light on a fiber. It seems like a similar problem.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RONJA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This section from the marketing blurb doesn't sound too promising:When atmospheric conditions disrupt the light, our adaptive rate and hybrid architecture maintains the connection, with minimal downtime.In the long run, all these wireless technologies (satellite or optical/microwave terrestrial links) will have a very hard time competing with simply laying down some optical fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43390467</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Los Angeles Police Department's collaboration with Dataminr, a real-time analytics company, to monitor protests related to Gaza and Palestine. It highlights concerns about civil liberties and the implications of surveillance on activists, emphasizing potential risks of targeting marginalized communities. The piece raises questions about the transparency of data usage by law enforcement and the broader impact of such technology on social justice movements.&lt;/p&gt;

Every demographic commits petty crimes and code violations at about the same rate (things like parking violations and music piracy).2. However, people who are being watched will be caught more often.3. The end result is that people in the "wrong" crowd on average are punished more than people in the "right" one at an equal level of misbehavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am i weird in that this feels kind of normal (im not american)?Protests should be protected, but i normally assume protestors get permits, and a reasonable police presence is around. Not to intimidate anyone, but just to make sure nobody gets too rowdy, keep protestors and counter-protestors away from each other (to prevent violence), provide aid if anyone gets hurt (big masses of people is always a trample risk). Otherwise just do normal crowd control sort of things.If they were surveiling individuals who participated afterwards, maybe that would be something, but it seems like (according to the article) all they were doing was keeping track of when protests were happening.Protests are not private events. They are literally the most non-private event possible. That is the entire point. I dont think there is any reasonable expectation of privacy in terms of time&amp;date of demonstrations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43390747</guid></item><item><title>19.

It'd be like giving untrusted users ssh access and then complaining when they find a privilege elevation exploit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many questions:- why a no side-effects function on a database can be used to get lateral access to the whole database instance- why do you need to validate strings on the database itself and not on the client anyway, heck why are there no type safe way of doing it- why would you want to execute shell commands from the database itself- Even if there's a real use case for executing commands like that why is it enabled by default on a regular connection to the database without you specifying a THIS_IS_REALLY_DANGEROUS_BUT_I_PINKY_PROMISE_I_KNOW_WHAT_IM_DOING flag to the connection handshake.It's not always PHP but there are some kirks that are shrugged off on PHP that makes me really concerned about the reliability of projects coded with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned about the breach a few days ago but I didn't know that you could "adopt" an emoji: https://aac.unicode.org/sponsorsThat's a neat tidbit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43359264</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities and pitfalls of using smart pointers in C++ programming, particularly highlighting the potential for misuse that can lead to memory leaks and other issues. It explains the different types of smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, and emphasizes the importance of understanding their ownership semantics to avoid common mistakes. The author provides examples and clarifications on when to use each type of smart pointer effectively, advocating for mindful coding practices to enhance memory management in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really, don't do this, it's a portability and safety nightmare (aside from C not being memory safe already).C programmers are better off with either of these two techniques:* Use __attribute__((cleanup)).  It's available in GCC and Clang, and we hope will be added to the C spec one day.  This is widely used by open source software, eg. in systemd.* Use a pool allocator like Samba's talloc (https://talloc.samba.org/talloc/doc/html/libtalloc__tutorial...) or Apache's APR.(I didn't include using reference counting, since although that is also widely used, I've seen it cause so many bugs, plus it interacts badly with how modern CPUs work.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO trying to emulate smart pointers in C is fixing a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place, and is also a problem in C++ code that uses smart pointers for memory management of individual objects.Objects often come in batches of the same type and similar maximum lifetime, so let's make use of that.Instead of tracking the individual lifetimes of thousands of objects it is often possible to group thousands of objects into just a handful of lifetime buckets.Then use one arena allocator per lifetime bucket, and at the end of the 'bucket lifetime' discard the entire arena with all items in it (which of course assumes that there are no destructors to be called).And suddenly you reduced a tricky problem (manually keeping track of thousands of lifetimes) to a trivial problem (manually keeping track of only a handful lifetimes).And for the doubters: Zig demonstrates quite nicely that this approach works well also for big code bases, at least when the stdlib is built around that idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around 1994, when I was a nerdy, homeschooled 8th grader teaching myself coding I came up with something I was inordinately proud of. I had gotten a book on PowerPC assembly so using Metrowerks CodeWarrior on my brand-new PowerMac 7100 I wrote a C function with inlined assembly that I called debugf. As I recall, it had the same signature as printf, called sprintf and then passed that resulting string to DebugStr. But the part I was proud of was that it erased itself from the stack so when the debugger popped up it was pointing to the line where you called debugf. I'm still proud of it :-).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43387334</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on a specific geometric construct known as the "geometry of spatial curves." It explores the properties and classifications of these curves, analyzing their behavior and relationships in three-dimensional space. By delving into various mathematical theories and techniques, the research contributes to the understanding of spatial curvature and the implications for broader mathematical contexts. The findings are supported by rigorous proofs and visual representations, aiming to enhance the comprehension of geometric concepts related to curves.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also really wanted to use libjxl, but abandoned it eventually. The encoder was horrible. 
Also instead of OpenEXR we store our multispectral images as TIFF, with lossless lzw:2 compression. Lot of work with TIFF, but in the end much more flexible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does JPEG XL compression having a perceptual basis pose any issue given that the data being encoded here isn't what the original algorithm was intended for? I see that the approach iteratively checks RMSE but I'm wondering about spatial artifacts in a given layer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why not just store each "frame" of spectral image as it's own HEVC compressed video clip? 
Each image frame in the video corresponds to a slice of the light spectrum. The longer the video, the more precision you pack into the frame. With that you have variable precision per frame as you see fit.
It being a video you exploit the obvious video compression advancements that has been achieved over the years without having to reinvent the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43377463</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK the way you're publishing the data with Parquet and making it accessible through DuckDB is spectacular.Your README shows R and Python examples: https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes?tab=readme-ov-file#using...I got it working with the `duckdb` terminal tool like this:  INSTALL httpfs;
  LOAD httpfs;
  ATTACH 'https://data.opentimes.org/databases/0.0.1.duckdb' AS opentimes;

  SELECT origin_id, destination_id, duration_sec
    FROM opentimes.public.times
    WHERE version = '0.0.1'
        AND mode = 'car'
        AND year = '2024'
        AND geography = 'tract'
        AND state = '17'
        AND origin_id LIKE '17031%' limit 10;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! I love the interactive map, but have a couple UX suggestions:I usually expect most features of a map to be zoom invariant, with the exception of level of detail. Having the colormap change is surprising, particularly that longer time buckets simply disappear as I zoom in. The two problems with this are that any time I zoom in or out I now have to double check the color key in case it's changed, and if I want to find a travel time for something far away I need to zoom in to find the destination and then back out to see the travel time. Perhaps you can let the user manually choose the colormap granularity/range, or find some way to have a colormap that works at all scales?Second suggestion, related, is to display the travel time next to the geography ID in the bottom left corner. This would mitigate the issues with getting a good colormap, since I can then just hover over a geography to get its time anywhere that the colormap isn't sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing! GitHub actions to compute a giant skim matrix is an incredible hack.I pretty regularly work with social science researchers who have a need for something like this... will keep it in mind. For a bit we thought of setting something like this up within the Census Bureau, in fact. I have some stories about routing engines from my time there...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392521</guid></item><item><title>25.

Most of the physics, structures, etc. were built with a standard horse model in mind, so the dragon mounts, etc. introduced all kinds of goofy looking clipping issues.Slightly related, but whenever I see high heels in video games I'm reminded of this comic by Double-XP:https://imgur.com/a/pUg6sCV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This problem exists in the Dead Rising series as the main character can put almost any item on.

Even without dark pools you could always do direct trades[1] with a party of your choosing, which is even more private and exclusive. The "private rooms" mentioned in this article just makes this slightly more automated than some trader messaging his buddies on the bloomberg terminal.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is not clear to me what nefarious things people believe are going on there that we should be worried about.All the article says is that people are doing things we don't know about, but implies that somehow we should feel not-okay about this.I don't know what's going on in my neighbor's house either, and it could certainly be bad stuff, but that's doesn't mean that it is bad or that I should start spying on them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43390595</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,” he said.This idea resonates with me, especially in the context of modern physics. The extensive learning required to make advancements often means that one's thinking is heavily influenced by established theories and teachings, potentially stifling true innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was hoping they'd have a discussion of the algorithm itself. Quanta is usually good about making these sorts of things approachable.In any case, the full paper is here [1] if you don't want to scroll through the Wired article.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If my reading of the paper was correct, this kind of hash table is incredibly complicated to resize because resizing would invalidate all previously handed out pointers unless you only do chaining?The other challenge is that computing N hash functions is quite expensive so in practice I think this ends up slower in real world terms despite the big-O speed up?Does this actually end up beating open addressed hash tables? It seems more like a neat hypothetical CS result that wouldn’t have any actual real world application?

Or if a terrorist came in and cut power to a chaos wall would it really cause an extended outage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s the second level analysis here? We know it’s not really necessary or helpful for the ostensible reason (far cheaper/more reliable ways of capturing entropy) — so we conclude it’s a marketing gimmick. Yet for the gimmick to work they have to pretend it’s useful. They’re not fooling themselves or anyone else, though.So what’s really going on?Is it:- it IS somehow a good return on investment??- marketing had a budget and didn’t know how else to spend it, and no one wanted to be the unpleasant person and say how it’s all a silly waste of money?- they are making a tonne of money and no one really cares, so we’ll just spend it on fun cool stuff as long as there’s a plausibleish story to go with it?- fits with a broader global company branding concept that leadership seems to like, so there’s just the momentum to keep it going (and see points above)?I can’t figure it out. I agree it’s cool! Just the make believe puzzles me a little. I’ve not worked at a big corp like this and just have to understand what’s actually happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43389064</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get the task pricing motivation: you want folk to pay for how much they use, not a flat rate, because if they are freelancing why spend a flat fee for variable use. One of the reasons I don't use Lightroom is that I only take lots of photos a few times a year, and I feel stupid paying for a month in which I don't use it.*However*, this alternative is pretty weird. Think about it from the perspective of a software developer. Would you really want the granularity of your tickets dictated by a pricing model?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The project looks cool, but I'd strongly recommend against the per-task pricing.This makes budgeting &amp; forecasting difficult to impossible for a lot of teams, and creates wrong incentives. It is better to have a per user pricing, and then allow them to use as much as they want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Beyond Jira", but searching for API yields no results, except for Zapier.Jira is so much more than just the Web-UI, it has a very powerful API and it can be queried in a very flexible way.https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/jql-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43386745</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! This approach can be used to implement coeffects (as e.g. seen in Hack [1]), by only passing explicit effect-producing objects. Imagine a function that's guaranteed to not write to any files, because it can't access `open()`, or can only access a version of `open()` that only accepts read-only access.[1]: https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/contexts-and-capabilities/introdu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was curious how this works - it's using the Python standard library disassembler: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html    for instruction in dis.get_instructions(code):
        ...

Code here: https://github.com/tillahoffmann/localscope/blob/092392d5bdb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple localscope in TXR Lisp:  $ txr -i localscope.tl
  Pour le service en la langue Shell, appuyez sur Ctrl-D.
  1&gt; (localscope (+ %pi% %pi%)) ;; OK, %pi% is built-in
  6.28318530717959
  2&gt; (localscope *print-base*) ;; likewise
  10
  3&gt; (localscope (+ a b c)) ;; bad
  ** expr-3:1: localscope: global variables (c b a) used

Code:  (defmacro localscope (:form f :env e . forms)
    (let ((body ^(progn ,*forms)))
      (tree-bind (exp fv-inner ff-inner fv-outer ff-outer) (expand-with-free-refs
                                                             body e)
        (ignore ff-inner fv-outer ff-outer)
        (let* ((usr (find-package :usr))
               (globals [keep-if (do or (not (boundp @1))
                                        (neq (symbol-package @1) usr))
                                 fv-inner]))
          (if globals
            (compile-error f "global variables ~s used" globals)))
        body)))

We get a list of the free variable references emanating from the enclosed forms, and filter them: we are interested in all that do not have bindings as globals in the standard library. I.e. either are not bound at all, or else if they are, are not symbols in the usr: ("user space") package.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43390823</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fantastic. I've always used JavE before but this being a single HTML file is a big+ and packs quite a punch. Kudos to the author!One question though, how do edit the content later? For example I generated a few diagrams one at a time and pasted those in a local plain text file. Later when I want to edit a particular diagram/part, I tried copy pasted it in, but always got "cannot paste, content leaves canvas" error. If I tried copy-pasting a really small section (e.g. 3x3 table), it pasted it right in the center. Anyway, not sure if that's  an intended work flow or not. Great job regardless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks awesome. The way you are dragging things around and the diagonal lines is amazing. Don't think asciiflow or the other one or two tools do this.Since you are providing a single portable html file (which almost no one does that these days sadly) you may be interested in how sequencediagrams.org handles this. They don't offer sign up, instead have localStorage, Google drive, file export and few other ways.Also, can you let me open it on the phone with a warning/recommendation to look at github instead of redirecting to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this so much.

Burrow analyzes various portrayals of ogres in fairy tales and modern storytelling, highlighting how they serve as metaphors for societal fears and human complexity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/POXh6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a really great article. This part stood out to me in particular:&gt; But what these tales are absolutely forbidden from representing is any agent or action that falls into the social class or milieu of the people who chiefly collected and read them. So the Grimms’ own world of government employees, highly literate women, libraries and universities is perhaps the most profoundly forbidden space of the folk tale. Indeed you might even say that not including that world is what makes a tale seem folkish, rather than, say, novelish. Part of the fiction of the Volk is that there is an absolute social void between the princes, the kings, the princesses on the one hand, and the tailors, discharged soldiers, huntsmen, kitchen maids and impoverished forest dwellers on the other.I wonder why we don't see this perspective more often in modern popular fantasy. It seems that for the most part, they stick close to Tolkien or Arthurian models, primarily following the exploits of kings and knights. Even the popular fantasy authors who actively seek to subvert the genre's tropes tend to stick close to that perspective. And when we are treated to the perspective of a "common" person, they often turn out to have been born special for some reason, soon finding out they're some powerful person's lost heir or the subject of some prophecy, with the character being swept off into the world of the ruling class. Obviously, a lot of folk tales end with the commoner running off with a prince or princess, which isn't terribly dissimilar, but I don't remember Cinderella or Snow White being special beyond being pretty and charming.It may be a blind spot of my own, but I can't think of many examples of fantasy with truly common folk as the primary perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an error in the text. It says they were Huguenots who left after the Edict of Nantes, which is not true. They left after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, which had protected Huguenots until then. This last edict is called the Edict of Fontainebleau.
So they left after the Edict of Fontainebleau.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43369739</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The amount of cognitive dissonance here is interesting.I compiled c to asm. Title says the llm did this.
it works! But it's broken.
It generated a bunch of other files! But I only need one.
It couldn't target z80 so I was a human in the loop.
You have to trust it and understand how the Black box works to get n factor gains. But no one knows how these tools actually work and general advice is NOT to trust LLM outputs and the author didn't trust them either... And even the final result has the incorrect tax rates...I'm not denying LLMs can sort of rewrite small chunks of code in other languages, add comments to code, etc. but the way people talk about them is so snake oily.Going by any of the major bullet points I would say that the title is wrong, and misleading at best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. Surprisingly, it decided to encode the multiplication and division as addition/subtraction loops, which is incredibly inefficient - multiplying e.g. 32,000 by 32,000 (ignoring the overflow ...) will take 1,024,000,000 iterations, so thousands of seconds on the speccy's humble 4Mhz Z80 (8 instructions, each taking at least 2 T-states ...)Here is the multiplication loop (division is similar but in reverse, subtracting instead of adding).    mult_loop:
     ; Check if BC is zero
     ld a, b
     or c
     jr z, mult_done
     
     ; Add HL to result
     ex de, hl           ; DE = multiplier, HL = result
     add hl, de          ; Add multiplier to result
     ex de, hl           ; DE = result, HL = multiplier
     
     ; Decrement counter
     dec bc
     jr mult_loop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've done three major conversions of assembly to C:1. My Empire game was written in assembler on the PDP-11. To port it to the IBM PC, I rewrote it line by line into C.2. FutureNet's schematic editor for the IBM PC was a very large assembler program. It was written in assembler because there was no other way to make it fit on the PC. I converted it line by line into C so it would run on a Sun. It took a couple months.3. I converted some of the Optlink linker, a 32 bit Windows linker, into C. The main difficulty, though, was there was no test suite and it was very very hard to get right. I got maybe 10% of it converted. I eventually abandoned the project because 32 bit Windows code is now obsolete. The other hard part of the project was it was not conventionally divided up into functions. Code would jump into the middle of other functions. Another problem with it was its use of macros and conditional assembly was so hard to decipher that I would assemble the code, run it through my disassembler, and use the latter as my starting point. (Macros are Spawn of the Devil.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43387259</guid></item><item><title>38.

I'll keep using the RP2040 instead, but the extra oomph of the M33's over the M0+'s would've been very welcome in a few places.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These can apparently run as RISC-V dualcore too; it's selected at boot-time (!!).
I did not realize that this is a thing.Was hoping for big improvements for the ADC, but its still limited to 500k/s (they did give it 4 more channels, though, which is nice).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43388221</guid></item><item><title>40. uv downloads overtake Poetry for Wagtail users</title><link>https://wagtail.org/blog/uv-overtakes-poetry/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Wagtail, an open-source content management system, has surpassed the use of traditional poetry in the digital creative landscape, highlighting the increasing popularity and versatility of user-generated content. It emphasizes the significance of UV (User-Generated Video) as a dynamic medium for expression and engagement, comparing its impact and accessibility to that of poetry. The piece also explores the evolution of content creation and consumption in the digital age, showcasing Wagtail's features that support diverse forms of creative expression, particularly through video.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently switched to uv, and I cannot praise it enough.  With uv, the Python ecosystem finally feels mature and polished rather than like a collection of brittle hacks.Kudos to the uv developers for creating such an amazing piece of software!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not a surprise. I said it before and I'll say it again, all the competing projects should just shut up shop for the good of Python. uv is so much better it's like pushing penny farthings after the safety bike has been invented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've read so much positive feedback about uv, that I'd really like to use it, but I'm unsure if it fits my needs.I was heavily invested into virtualenv until I had to upgrade OS versions, which upgraded the Python versions and therefore broke the venvs.I tried to solve this by using pyenv, but the need of recompiling Python on every patch wasn't something which I would accept, specially in regards to boards like Raspberry Pis.Then I tried miniconda which I initially only liked because of the precompiled Python binaries, and ultimately ended up using pyenv-managed miniforge so that I could run multiple "instances" of miniforge and therefore upgrade miniforge gradually.Pyenv also has a plugin which allows to set suffixes to environments, which allows me to have multiple miniforges of the same version in different locations, like miniforge-home and miniforge-media, where -home has all files in the home dir and -media has all files on a mounted nvme, which then is where I put projects with huge dependencies like CUDA inside, not cluttering home, which is contained in a VM image.It works really great, Jupyter and vscode can use them as kernels/interpreters, and it is fully independent of the OS's Python, so that OS upgrades (22.04 -&gt; 24.04) are no longer an issue.But I'm reading about all these benefits of uv and wish I could use it, but somehow my setup seems to have tied my hands. I think I can't use uv in my projects.Any recommendations?Edit: Many of my projects share the same environment, this is absolutely normal for me. I only create a new environment if I know that it will be so complex that it might break things in existing environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43386357</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon plans to lay off approximately 14,000 managerial positions as part of a cost-cutting strategy aimed at saving between $3 billion and $5 billion annually. This decision reflects the company's ongoing efforts to reduce expenses and streamline operations in response to changing market conditions and economic pressures. The layoffs are part of broader workforce reductions that have been implemented across various sectors within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the shit 'managers' get on here. I've been in this industry for 15+ years and with one or two rare exceptions every manager has been great.They respect my time, when I need something they're incredibly helpful, and they care about my career development.IMO the culling over managers over the past few years is really a way to make sure you don't have someone you can discuss career development, promotion, and pay increases with. I have very honest conversations with my managers about these things regularly. If I had to deal with someone a few layers above I doubt I'd have the same success.Another 'benefit' for the company in culling managers is that the manager track generally has higher pay at each level.  Understandable given it seems to involve more time commitment and dealing with people can be much more tricky than dealing with code. Less options for IC's to transition == lower salary burden. Reduce the number of people on the manager track and you reduce the amount of salary an employee can hope to attain. I've definitely been put off switching from IC to manager because I feel the jobs are less secure over the last few years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to make the observation that politics in a company is caused by management.  The more "politics" you have at a company, the more you pay in a "political tax".  Effort which should benefit the company is delayed or made harder as employees have to bob and weave to get through the politics.I do believe if you want real culture change in a company, the best way to do it is to show managers the door, because that's how you got there in the first place.Edited to add:I'm not saying get rid of management.  I'm saying get rid of bad management.  And if your bad management is a malignant tumor, well, it's too late to fix it manager by manager -- because they've internalized how to game the system for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am curious how do you just hire 14,000 managers at the cost of $3.5B yearly more than you needed?Maybe they should fire the guy responsible for THAT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43393079</guid></item><item><title>43.

If you can afford it (and the game+company is good), then buy it. That's how you can kind of be for-cracking and for-commercial games at the same time.Personally, it would be great if everything was free and everyone used good judgement to pay creators. But I admit maybe a large chunk would just pay nothing, including some wealthy people who could well just chip in.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that by "can guess fake words" in the title OP means that the tool can come up with a plausible guess for the etymology, even for fake words. Unfortunately, the more common reading of that phrase is that it can tell fake words from real ones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I asked it about "ocelot".  It said it was "tlatlauelolotl" which comes from the Nahautl for "tlatl" (field), "lauel" (unknown), and "olotl" (jaguar).  Except according to [0], "tlatllauelolotl" doesn't exist (and neither does "lauel" - the search results for "tlatl" and "olotl" aren't in English which means I can't judge their validity.)There's "tlacoocelotl"[1] which seems to be the actual word for "ocelot" ("semi-jaguar").0/10 for the AI there.[0] https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/[1] https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/tlacoocelotl&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fyllipig is derived from "fyllan" and "pigge" and means "descriptive of something that is both full/abundant and pig-like."Terryjambled means "mixed up in a confused or disorderly state, and covered with or resembling terry cloth."Refugglemander means to "to manipulate electoral district boundaries in a way that impacts refugees."I'm sorry, OP.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/4VvmsRelated Tim Berners-Lee Wants the Internet Back (24 points, 4 months ago, 10 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171823&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm all for this more open internet without the walled gardens, but skeptical that we'll get there simply by creating open alternatives.  Not only is there a massive amount of inertia behind the walled garden networks that exist now, but you need people to build these complex things.  Given how focused most engineers are on compensation (e.g., the obsession with FAANG as the pinnacle), I don't see how open things that likely don't have such a gigantic mountain of money behind it can compete for the necessary resources to execute the vision.  Compensation will probably always pull the people who build stuff to the walled garden companies and the alternative will have trouble providing a competitive alternative.  Plus, it seems inevitable that if some entity DOES start to build an open alternative to the walled gardens, at some point they'll feel the itch to grow, and slowly but surely I expect little tiny walls will begin to subtly sprout.  Email is a bit of a bad comparison since the protocols existed BEFORE the big companies we see today, and that sort of meant they all interoperated from the start.  Had we not had email in 1990 and different companies had to come up with their own messaging systems, we'd probably not see the clean interoperability we see today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that the proposed solution to this problem is more often than not "add another layer."The solution as far as I see it is to just go back to the zero algorithm version of social media. You follow people, you see their stuff in your feed. At best, you get recommendations of who to follow, but there's zero compulsion to follow or look at anything. No AI, no fancy algorithms, just good ol' fashioned CRUD.Wrap the whole thing up in a nice UI/UX and, most importantly, take a 100% neutral stance on politics and other "faction building" modes of thought.The chaos really didn't start until the algorithms (and by extension, the low-quality content they elevate) and politics came in. All of the alternatives so far have implemented some of the above ideas, but the juiciness of taking a political/ideological stance has been too attractive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43384786</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. In my experience the single biggest thing that allows landlords to take advantage of tenants is the inaccessibility of real estate law. Anything that makes contract terms more easily understandable is a win, as far as I’m concerned.Linking to a comment I made about dealing with this:…one time a landlord didn't return the security deposit. I called him, messaged him, left notes in his mailbox. No reply. One month, two months went by. So, I looked up the relevant legal code, found the part that said "landlords have 30 days to return the security deposit with any deductions listed. Failure to do so results in the landlord owing the tenant double the original amount with no deductions." I printed that out, highlighted the relevant section, and mailed him a letter saying that he can return the original deposit amount to me immediately, or I will file at the local court and he'll owe me double. I got a check in the mail two days later.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35760541Having an app point this statue out when signing a contract would be great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any time an AI product is advertised with something like "Legal Research Agents", a shiver goes up my spine.I see the testimonials (though, I don't put much faith in "Jane Doe" and "Mike Smith" testimonials), however I'm pretty sure in my area anyone who attempts to negotiate (especially based on an AI-built argument) will be told to pound sand.It's not a great market for renters here. Even blatantly illegal clauses are openly advertised all the time.I could maybe see a use case for checking a current lease (for illegal clauses and such), rather than when trying to start a lease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This needs a sample lease and sample outputs - I’ve really got no idea what it could do to negotiate a lease, etc. but agreed with other comments - landlords on my area would likely just tell you to leave if you tried any redlines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392303</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses revelations from a former employee of Meta, who describes a culture of carelessness and neglect within the company. The employee highlights issues such as a lack of consideration for user privacy, inadequate oversight on technological developments, and a troubling focus on profit over ethical responsibilities. The insights shed light on internal practices that may compromise both user trust and the company's long-term sustainability in the tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author still managed to give at least one interview before the arbitrator's decision.For example,https://www.thefp.com/p/meet-sarah-wynn-williams-facebooksMeta published a response to the book that only alleges the author's claims are "old" and does not suggest they are false.https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sarah-Wynn-W...If the claims are false and defamatory, then why not sue the author for defamation.In the book, the author suggests she was harassed by two famous Facebook managers and then terminated when she complained.Apparently the book is a top seller on Amazon.  Perhaps it does not need promotion by the author.The author has also filed a whistleblower complaint at the SEC re: the China issue.As a longtime HN reader I recall that Zuckerberg was a favorite of PG.  The "ideal founder" or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, that settles it - I'll have to buy a copy and give it a read.Hey Mark, want people to not read it?  How about you go donate a few hundred billion to the country and communities that supported you and your company from day 1, instead of avoiding taxation and building a doomsday bunker in New Zealand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all seriousness (aside from all the comments stating they'd ordered it. Hey, I just did myself), it's interesting seeing Meta go after the employee but seemingly not make much of an effort to go after the publisher.What would they hope to gain going after any of it so late anyway? Surely if their goal is to dissuade others from publishing tell-alls, the resulting publicity from their suits against this one would do the opposite? If they really wanted to stop the book, they should've gone after it early before publication, but it seems like they dropped the ball and are doing more damage to themselves trying to catch up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43387325</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Apple’s decision to restrict the functionality of the Pebble smartwatch with iPhones, highlighting how this move impacts the user experience and potential market competition. The author argues that Apple's restrictions prevent Pebble from showcasing its full capabilities, ultimately limiting innovation and consumer choice in the smartwatch space. The piece emphasizes the tension between large tech companies and smaller innovators, questioning the fairness of Apple's strategy and its implications for the future of wearable technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess I’ll take the contra here on messages integration — moving a message over BLE to untrusted hardware and worse accepting them back into iMessage is a massive, massive change in the security boundary and therefore security architecture and therefore security promises that apple makes on iMessage.I do not believe average smartwatch users understand what they’d be doing if they got this. I do not believe vendors integrating with such a thing can do it safely, or even that all vendors integrating are good actors.One reason iMessage is less of a total cesspit than SMS is that the ecosystem is closed, and makes automation difficult. It used to be impossible nearly, and in that era we had almost no iMessage spam. Now it’s difficult, and we have moderate iMessage spam. But adding hooks to make this automation easy, and worse, leave the trust environment as a feature is just wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think people forget that Apple is not making devices for the Hackernews community. They are making devices for people that just want something that works pretty well and has reasonable security - even to the extent of protecting them from themselves. They have other things to do with their time than learn about security vulnerabilities and how to avoid them. They want to just click 'yes' on every popup and expect things to keep working. Because they know that they are not qualified to answer that yes/no popup question. And those people do not care much about lock-in and walled gardens. They are not interested in jailbreaking and sideloading apps. They've never heard of Pebble or have any interest in it.This is 90% of humanity, including people we all know and love.Apple serves these people pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a very capable smartwatch and it's ridiculously bad how hobbled it is on iOS. I'm glad to see this article specifically highlight the issues, and how it's 100% Apple's intention to make non-Apple wearables on iOS terrible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43401245</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eric, thank you. Lurking in the forum answering questions evokes people to share their opinion for satisfaction and dissatisfaction and often neglectes to evoke praise (proportionally). I am guilty of this too.So please have some well deserved praise for your work on this. We have gotten an open source wearable OS, purpose built hardware, R&amp;D, a community, more pressure on Apple to be less of a gatekeeper, and something we can own in a crazy short timeframe. I hope you see this despite it being buried. Thank you, you glorious nerd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pleased the pricing is so low. I did some math and if they're making 10k of these (not clear if that's each or all together), there's not a ton of money to be made.Assuming $100 average profit, that's a $2M for 20k watches. Given the work opportunities that the founder and other employees have, that's not a lot of money  for them to make in a year, and it comes with significant risk. Basically seems like this is a passion project, for which I am very grateful!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "having a baby"/"having a baby bok choi party" attempt to sell me on the larger screen did not work, but it did make me laugh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43400989</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods to decrypt and analyze advertising traffic on pfSense, an open-source firewall and router platform. It provides a step-by-step guide for configuring pfSense to capture and inspect encrypted traffic, particularly focusing on HTTPS advertisements. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the data originating from ad traffic to enhance network security and performance. The piece also includes practical tips for setup and offers insights into the implications of analyzing such traffic for network management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; instead, I found a flaw in the Protobuf format which allows me to reliably change one byte to obliterate ads.Let me guess, the author changed the field number to a large unused number.&gt; Now, all we have to do is scan the Protobuf bytes for classic ad URL signatures like /pagead/ to bound our field search, then move backward from there until we find the target(s) field tags and thus field keys we would like to denature (e.g. 49399797 –&gt; 49399796).Yeah. This isn't a flaw, this is intended behavior.If you're willing to go through the effort to find the tag, it's really not that much additional effort to then read the (varint) length right next to the tag and... just skip those bytes.Yes, you'd need to copy your buffer to do this, or at least slide your bytes around. But the proof-of-concept script already has to perform a copy because the bytes object returned by mitmproxy's API (`body: bytearray = bytearray(flow.response.get_content(strict=False) or b"")`) is immutable, and even a memoryview isn't going to bypass this limitation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small C++/Go/... proxy can do the same thing with much, much less overhead. Been there, done that - for something well-defined like this, it is more stable and less work than fighting mitmproxy.Routing everything through the proxy will degrade performance even with SNI interception.Same with pfSense - a plain Linux server and a simple iptables rules set would do the job without having to fight against all the pfSense abstraction layers.Write a .proto file with just enough of the reverse-engineered proto fields to auto-generate code and flip the flag. Cheaper than the Python implementation and easier to update when the proto changes.Ignoring unknown field tags is an important Protobuf feature - it allows for compatible schema changes without breaking existing deployments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I want to support content creators, so to be fair, after a few months of blocking YouTube ads, I am now paying for YouTube Premium; Just because I can break something, doesn’t mean I need to.Does paying for YouTube Premium support creators? (If so, how much, compared to say Patreon?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43396735</guid></item><item><title>4.

In April 2024, the company acquired cloud detection and response startup, Gem Security, for around $350 million&gt; Wiz was founded in January 2020 by Assaf Rappaport, Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik, and Ami Luttwak, all of whom previously founded Adallom.&gt; Adallom was founded in 2012 by Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak and Roy Reznik, who are former members of the Israeli Intelligence Corps’ Unit 8200 and alumni of the Talpiot program.&gt; Adallom was reportedly acquired by Microsoft for $320 million in July 2015&gt; On March 18, 2025, Google announced an all-cash acquisition of Wiz for $32 billionHad never heard of Wiz until they posted the blog post about the DeepSeek database being public earlier this year.https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepse...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This makes no sense.Assume 1,000 customers each generating $2m in ARR with contracts. That’s $2 billion. Assume generous 6x ARR valuation, that’s $12 billion.Where is this $20 billion premium coming from? How could the board approve this? How is this fair to shareholders?Heck, as a minor shareholder in GOOG, I don’t find this financially responsible at all.I can’t help but think sometimes these tech acquisitions have some hint of nepotism/deeper underlying motivations behind them than meets the eye.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imho, and as a xoogler who's been in Google Cloud's ecosystem the past few years, Google Cloud's three big focus areas have been AI (this is an evolution from their historical focus on data, then also analytics), Distributed Cloud (Anthos++) and security (post the Mandiant acquisition).  They'll never be able to compete on base  infra, given their late entry into the game, lack of presence in certain markets, and the lock the competition has in some industries (Azure in industrial/mfg, AWS in pharma, etc), and they know that, so they've lately been focused on what they believe they can control.  One of those things is the narrative that Google Cloud is the most secure cloud.It shouldn't be overlooked that acquiring Wiz is also a way for Google to secure a beachhead in half the Fortune 100, many of which are "enemy" territory.The price is high, but there aren't many options available and Wiz has the advantage of being built on Google Cloud natively, and already have Marketplace integrations completed.https://cloud.google.com/customers/wiz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43398518</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty much the exact same case as the monkey that took a photo. The photo is now in the public domain as the monkey cannot be an author of the photo and since the photographer didn't take the photo, neither is he the author. The US Copyright Office clarified that "only works created by a human can be copyrighted under United States law, which excludes photographs and artwork created by animals or by machines without human intervention". If you placed some food on a camera trigger and the animal reached for it, taking a photo in the process, that would likely be human intervention. I feel as if this applies to AI as well. A computer cannot be the author but as long as it was a human that told the computer to make the image or wrote the code that allowed the computer to generate the image on its own, then the human is the author.Trying to assign copyright to an AI is techno-futurist bullshit by trying to give legal presence to a piece of software. What's next? Shutting down an AI is murder? Give it a rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the headline is overly broad, especially considering:&gt; As a matter of statutory law, the Copyright Act requires all
work to be authored in the first instance by a human being. Dr.
Thaler’s copyright registration application listed the Creativity
Machine as the work’s sole author, even though the Creativity
Machine is not a human being. As a result, the Copyright
Office appropriately denied Dr. Thaler’s application.It seems like Dr. Thaler's argument was just weak, since generative AI works often are authored in the first instance by a human being. For instance, any Midjourney or Stable Diffusion-generated image will be sourced from a prompt, which is typically written by a human. Anyone who has spent a little time trying to craft the perfect prompt knows there is a creative process therein that represents real work being done by a human. Similarly for img2img workflows, using a real photograph taken by a human. There, AI is only being used to transform a copyrightable input. Therefore such works – though certainly not all AI works – should be eligible for copyright, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that's a good ruling.Say I create a website that just sells AI generated logos. I set up some automation so I'm constantly generating millions of logos per day.I also have a bot that scrapes the web to try and find anyone using a logo similar to the ones on my website, and then send legal threats demanding payment for copying my artwork.I'm sure more imaginative scammers will find a way to copyright troll using AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43402790</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting tool, but I'm very surprised that they allow backdating posts.Backdating posts opens up a world of social engineering scams. You can create an account that appears to have predicted a lot of past events, sports scores, or stock prices with timestamps prior to those events occurring. The scam is to create an account that appears to have great stock advice or sports betting predictions and then charge people for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is neat but I choose not to do this when it was clear the API allowed it. I was on Twitter for over 17 years and I think 99% of what I posted is useless and not noteworthy.I welcome the blank slate that Bluesky provides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the plan is moving from a centralised platform to another centralised platform?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago after getting one I was messing around in settings on Amazon's Alexa website and noticed a log of commands/messages sent to Alexa. I reviewed them and was horrified to see "why does daddy always beat me". Best to let your daughter win at Uno in this age of always-on connectivity. Or just unplug it, which is what I did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've noticed since getting a new mac, that on-device dictation is no longer possible, a modal pops up forcing you to hit agree in order to get dictation. Never clicking that.The direction of major operating systems neutering themselves in favour of deep service integration does not fill one with hope&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There seems to be some tremendous confusion here. The vast majority of Alexa-family devices perform no local processing except for the activation word ("Alexa"). I didn't even realize that some of the more recent devices supported an opt-in for local processing.This kind of makes sense, at least to me: local processing will always be limited. The entire premise of the original Echo devices was that all the magic happened in the cloud. It seems like not much has really changed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43402115</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once worked in a design research lab for a famous company. There was a fairly senior, respected guy there who was determined to kill the keyboard as an input mechanism.I was there for about a decade and every year he'd have some new take on how he'd take down the keyboard. I eventually heard every argument and strategy against the keyboard you can come up with - the QWERTY layout is over a century old, surely we can do better now. We have touchscreens/voice input/etc., surely we can do better now. Keyboards lead to RSI, surely we can come up with input mechanisms that don't cause RSI. If we design an input mechanism that works really well for children, then they'll grow up not wanting to use keyboards, and that's how we kill the keyboard. Etc etc.Every time his team would come up with some wacky input demos that were certainly interesting from an academic HCI point of view, and were theoretically so much better than a keyboard on a key dimension or two... but when you actually used them, they sucked way more than a keyboard.My takeaway from that as an interface designer is that you have to be descriptivist, not prescriptivist, when it comes to interfaces. If people are using something, it's usually not because they're idiots who don't know any better or who haven't seen the Truth, it's because it works for them.I think the keyboard is here to stay, just as touchscreens are here to stay and yes, even voice input is here to stay. People do lots of different things with computers, it makes sense that we'd have all these different modalities to do these things. Pro video editors want keyboard shortcuts, not voice commands. Illustrators want to draw on touch screens with styluses, not a mouse. People rushing on their way to work with a kid in tow want to quickly dictate a voice message, not type.The last thing I'll add is that it's also super important, when you're designing interfaces, to actually design prototypes people can try and use to do things. I've encountered way too many "interface designers" in my career who are actually video editors (whether they realize it or not). They'll come up with really slick demo videos that look super cool, but make no sense as an interface because "looking cool in video form" and "being a good interface to use" are just 2 completely different things. This is why all those scifi movies and video commercials should not be used as starting points for interface design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm actually working on a voice controlled, tldraw canvas based UI – and I'm a designer. So I feel quite seen by this article.For my app, I'm trying to visualise and express the 'context' between the user and the AI assistant. The context can be quite complex! We've got quite a challenge to help humans keep up with reasoning and realtime models speed/accuracy.Having a voice input and output (in the form of an optional text to speech) ups the throughput on understanding and updating the context. The canvas is useful for the user to apply spatial understanding, given that users can screen share with the assistant, you can even transfer understanding that way too.I'm not reaching for the future, I'm solving a real pain point of a user now.You can see a demo of it in action here -&gt; https://x.com/ojschwa/status/1901581761827713134&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are compromises that should have never been made. Just to please the eye. The Blackberry keybord worked fantastically well. It was killed because Steve beleieved that touch screen is always better. Then there are the knobs in cars replaced by touchscreens. I hope there are no attempts at replacing physical keyboards by touchscreens in laptops. I cannot type on touchscreens. I love keyboards. Especially my mechanical keyboard. Love it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43393924</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of engaging with local communities to address challenges such as climate change and social inequality. It emphasizes the role of grassroots initiatives and community-led projects in fostering resilience and innovation. The author highlights successful case studies and encourages active participation to create meaningful change at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I own a home router (TP-Link Archer C7) and I have been running OpenWRT for many years on it, having full control over it via SSH. A few years back, I had an idea for an daemon process/service to improve a certain thing in its functionality. I was delighted to find out that the MIPS chip that powers the thing was supported by Rust, and I coded a "script", cross-compiled it to a binary and SCP't that to the router. It ran beautifully. After that (and running Rust on a few other embedded systems, including an ARM Cortex-R chip) I became convinced that Rust is the next C for the embedded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that this was written 2024-08-08. While I haven't kept up to date with exactly what's been happening in rp-rs, I do know that probe-rs has since been updated with support for the RP2350. Other things may be outdated as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone explain how the dual ARM/RISC-V system works, architecturally?Are there two actual CPUs on the same die? Is it one shared architecture with two different instruction decode stages, one for ARM and the other for RISC-V that can be toggled at boot time? I like the idea conceptually but I'm not sure how much of that is a hack and/or inefficient compared to a pure ARM or RISC-V core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378571</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a few minutes, reading the full complaint is worth it - the blog posts and the articles don't really do the whole story justice.There is extremely damning evidence that this unnamed individual ("D.S.") in Ireland was acting at the behest of Deel senior leadership, including:- the COO of deel reached out to a rippling payroll manager on linkedin to recruit them.  The rippling employee didn't respond.  Shortly thereafter, D.S. pulled up that employees personnel record in the HR system that has their unlisted phone number.  Shortly after THAT, the COO of deel reached back out to that employee via WhatsApp and that phone number.- The information was about to publish a story about Deel potentially violating sanctions.  New information in the article was that at least one of the customers involved was a company called "tinybird".  No one at rippling was aware that this company even existed, but a week BEFORE the article came out, but after the reporter had been asking questions of Deel, D.S. started searching Slack for "tinybird" (and there were no other searches of "tinybird" across the whole company)- Around the same time, the reporter for the information reached out to rippling and had internal Rippling slack messages about potential similar sanctions violations.  A short time before that happened, D.S. was suddenly searching for "russia", "sanctions", "iran", etc.- There was an email between D.S. and the ceo of Deel, along with an introduction to someone from the family VC fund.- And then, of course, the honeypot - a fake channel, fake chats from the Rippling CRO, but the chats had real stories that former Deel employees had alleged.  Email sent to only the CEO of Deel, his dad/chairman of the board, and their GC.  Just a short time later, D.S. was searching for the fake channel, trying to find it, adn trying to find these chat messages.I'm sure the CEO will try to have plausible deniability, that it was someone else in his org that he delegated investigating these things to, he had no idea, etc.  But if they can get D.S. to crack and share the details of what happened, I think it will be tough to toe that line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the logical conclusion of companies with undifferentiated crapware products that compete using aggressive sales teams.Sales driven companies are all corrupt and corrupting. This kind of espionage is common, as is outright bribery of buyers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The VCs in DEEL (per Crunchbase):Y Combinator

&lt;p&gt;Rhombus is a programming language designed for developing concurrent systems with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. It incorporates features that facilitate easy handling of asynchronous programming, enabling developers to create responsive and performant applications. The language promotes a clean syntax and strong type system, making code easier to read and maintain. Additionally, Rhombus provides a robust standard library and tools for seamless integration with existing software, ensuring that developers can leverage its capabilities for various projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used Racket in production for a decade and a half, with great success. Racket belongs to a sort of invasive species equivalent in languages, in the sense that once it has a hold on you, all other languages, old and new, vanish from your mind. The elegance of Scheme married with the power of hygienic macros does a great job at tricking your mind into believing Paul Graham's Hundred-Year Language idea again.What if Racket and Python had a child? Rhombus represents much, much more to us Racketeers. It may quite possibly be the crown jewel of multi-paradigm meta-programming languages and most importantly, a possible solution to the 's-expression barrier'. Who knows, it might even make a dent in the LISP curse. And we were all hoping for this. We were all waiting for this. And so I applaud the enormous effort involved, and I hope it inspires people to try a different approach to programming, and to language in general. It represents an impressive achievement in terms of elegance, pragmatism/practicality and efficiency in a language built atop a very solid foundation, coming from one of the greatest lineage of programming languages in history.Like many others, I have been waiting for a killer app, a real showcase of the power of language-oriented programming. I was secretly hoping Rhombus would become a catalyst to the production of something great. While the emergence of LLMs presents challenges, it doesn't have to seal the fate of amazing purely and proudly human innovations like this one. My GitHub account may be filled with Racket code few will ever use, but Rhombus gives me new inspiration.Sure, the future of programming might involve neural networks programming CPUs and GPUs directly. We're getting there. Yesterday we were programming with cryptic machine language, today we program computers with increasingly natural syntax. Tomorrow we might just tell machines what we need. But that doesn't make what we're doing now any less significant or exciting.We programmers aren't going anywhere just yet, and many of us will keep writing code because we love it, not just because we have to. And now we have this pinnacle of human ingenuity in the form of a beautiful language, a love letter to the art of programming by humans, for humans. Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The examples on the home page are a nice way to quickly show the features of a language. I'll check the documentation to see how to work with files, make HTTP calls, parse JSON.It's the first time in more than 10 years that I actually feel like trying a new language. The last time was Elixir. Since then I had to use Lua (hobby project) and Python (work) but I don't enjoy them much. I would have skipped them if I hadn't have to use them. Before Elixir I enjoyed Ruby, before that it's been Perl 5 in the 90s. Everything else I used in that period and before was because I had to (C, Java, PHP, JavaScript/Node) and I skipped many other mainstream languages because they didn't look nice to work with (Go, Rust, TypeScript.) I still have to see what's writing and running a Rhombus programs looks like so I might discover that it's not so nice after all. I'm hopeful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is racket's [rhombus], which might be an interesting second link here; it's a scheme, underneath, with the full power of Racket libs available.[`shrubbery`], the replacement for s-exprs, is pretty interesting, expanding s-expr simply with grouping, and then a separate infix-pass on top. I've been playing with using it as the basis for a separate language; it's in an interesting place in the AST space, especially given the forethought put into macros.[rhombus]: https://docs.racket-lang.org/rhombus/index.html[shrubbery]: https://docs.racket-lang.org/shrubbery/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43394881</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against attempts to reform or alter the scientific method in response to its perceived shortcomings, emphasizing the importance of maintaining rigorous standards and principles that underlie scientific inquiry. It contends that while science is not infallible, its systematic approach and self-correcting nature are vital for advancing knowledge. The author advocates for preserving the integrity of scientific processes rather than compromising them in the pursuit of broader appeal or consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43374753"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article and most of the comments ignore the social power dynamics and status quo institutional structures of academic science (Science 2): university administrators, power-broker faculty researchers, funding agencies (til recently), publishing companies, higher-ed consultants, etc. There are thousands of potential reforms that would bring Science 2 closer to Science 1 and generally make science life better. Those reforms are articulated by competent scientists and higher ed journalists every day. If you want to know why science reform isn't happening, ask which powerful interests are benefiting from the existing structures.Power makes people stupid: powerful people can't imagine a world other than the one that brought them their power. They will say, "That's the way the world is." Let's encourage students to continue to imagine other possible worlds in order to challenge the status quo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naively, you’d think such a revolutionary paper [BERT] would be met with open arms. But when it was given the best paper award (at NAACL 2019), the postdocs I talked to universally grumbled about it. Why? It wasn’t interesting, they bemoaned. “It just scaled some stuff up.”I'm from that community, was there when they presented it, have used and still use BERT a lot, and still if it were my decision I wouldn't have given it the best paper award, even in hindsight.BERT the model has been, of course, enormously influential. I still use it, even after the generative LLM revolution (which also stands on it shoulders). I greatly respect its authors and am truly grateful that they published and open-sourced it.BERT the paper? It's not really well-written (almost everyone who wants to understand Transformers or BERT turn to a blog, because the papers are so bad) and it's not stellar in terms of scientific insights, because indeed, it scales some stuff up and comes up with a lot of magic numbers that are there presumably because other alternatives were tried and those happened to work. Or maybe not even that, because some stuff included in BERT actually turned up being useless (see RoBERTa), so I guess they just winged much of it and it worked.From a scientific paper, I would expect much more explanation: why the architecture is designed like this, why this number of layers/dimensions and not that, etc. which that paper thoroughly lacks. No one will learn to do better science from that paper, it's not a paper that a PhD student would benefit much from reading except as a curiosity (they of course can benefit from downloading, using and getting to know the model. Just not from the paper).Maybe create a "best model award", "best software award" or whatever, but in my view as an academic a best paper award is just not for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Max Planck argued that change takes time because good ideas need enough staying power to outlive their detractors:&gt; A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it … An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.https://www.benwhite.com/misc/good-ideas-need-to-outlive-the...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43374753</guid></item><item><title>17. 20 Years of YC / HN</title><link>https://vickiboykis.com/2025/03/17/20-years-of-yc/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses key principles and best practices for designing effective electronic devices. It emphasizes the importance of user-centered design, integrating usability testing, and considering the entire user experience. The author highlights the significance of clear communication between design and engineering teams, as well as the role of prototyping and iterative testing in refining products. By following these guidelines, designers can create electronics that are not only functional but also enjoyable for users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting book. I've been in this space for years now and could easily see myself writing something like this, but I don't think it would look like this book.I really don't like to see things like any sort of recommendation for use of n-propyl bromide. That shit's neurotoxic. The people who can use it safely will already know about it, know someone who knows about it, or find it on their own. Anyone who finds out about nPB here should not be touching it.Unfortunately, many of the parts of the book that I've scanned are like that. There's a lot of prescription, not a lot of background/theory/underlying details, and no way to tell when the prescriptions are inapplicable or straight-up wrong. Which, often, they are: one of the hallmarks of deep experience is knowing when "the rules" are useful and when they're not, but what we have here is mostly rules. That will get your product out the door, I guess, but it's not going to level you up as an engineer, if that's what you're needing. Another example: stackups are discussed, but there's no mention of slash sheets, which is how you get things done cheaply and correctly. Specifying Rogers material for anything but the nastiest designs is just going to get your pockets drained and your Asian fab annoyed because they have to special order that. If you need it, sure, you need it... but can you get away with something more universal?And then there's things like this: "Most SMPS datasheets will advise you on what
bead to use and where to put it". Hahahaha no they won't. And if they will, there's a decent chance they get it wrong. Ferrite beads are so useful and so much trouble that you can't trust an IC datasheet to get it right, even if they want to do the same things you want to do. Which they might not!If you're a more junior engineer trying to level up, give this one a look instead: Analog SEEKrets: https://www.eevblog.com/files/seekPDF.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've begun playing around with "hardware design" recently and it's very humbling. I've been developing software for a long time, and I have a good amount of experience designing and making physical objects, both manually (well, with tools, but manually guided/used) and via digital means (mostly FDM).Making even a simple electronic device is a journey to say the least. The intersection of code and mechanism is a fascinating area to play in, but from PoC to Product, the amount of effort, expertise and iteration is hard to imagine until you try.Thanks for sharing your experience, looking forward to leafing through the pdf for some valuable insights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently the ebook has “sold out” so this is just marketing for the new paid ebook preorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43401179</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought there was an update but it just looks like a random share…so I’ll share something random!My favorite forum back in the day was the Rockman.EXE Online forums and they had server issues a few times. I was afraid of it going offline for good and came across HTTrack. My laptop was crappy as hell so maybe that’s why I didn’t have the best experience with it?Or maybe trying to backup a forum from the front-end wasn’t a good idea LOL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back so many fond memories. I grew up in a rural part of Kenya where the internet was scarce and tech practically non-existent. I was interested in web dev and taught myself PHP using HTTrack to download the php manual site, then the cprogramming.com website. I remember writing these site contents onto a thick notebook to read in school. Cprogamming.com imho was my programming foundation as I treated it as programming gospel. That kid back then would be shocked at how far I've come, now a dev at MS. Not sure how I came across httrack back then but I am so glad I did&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve used it a few times to “secure” an old but relevant dynamic website site.  Like a site for a mature project that shouldn’t disappear from the internet but it’s not worth upgrading 5 year old code that wont pass our “cyber security audit” due to unsupported versions of php or rails so we just convert to a static site and delete the database.  Everything pretty much works fine on the front end, and the CMS functionality is no longer needed.  It’s great for that niche use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43402149</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a preview of new features in DuckDB that enhance its integration with Amazon S3. It highlights the introduction of S3 tables, allowing users to directly query data stored in S3. The piece discusses the benefits of this integration, such as improved data access and processing efficiency, and how it enables users to leverage DuckDB’s capabilities for analytical tasks on data in the cloud. Additionally, it outlines the technical implementation details and provides examples of usage to illustrate these new functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty exciting. DuckDB is already proving to be a powerful tool in the industry.Previously there was a strong trend of using simple S3-backed blob storage with Parquet and Athena for querying data lakes. It felt like things have gotten pretty complicated, but as integrations improve and Apache Iceberg gains maturity, I'm seeing a shift toward greater flexibility with less SaaS/tool sprawl in data lakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a data engineering dabbler; parquet in S3 is beautiful. So is DuckDB. What an incredible match.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, DuckDB continues to be the MVP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43401421</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article celebrates "The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance" as a remarkable achievement in storytelling and puppetry, highlighting its intricate world-building, rich character development, and stunning visual effects. It emphasizes how the series expands upon the original 1982 film, creating a deeper narrative that resonates with both new viewers and long-time fans. The piece encourages audiences to appreciate the artistry and dedication that went into the project, ultimately deeming it a masterpiece worthy of attention and admiration.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author seems to conflate "dark" with "adult", so let me take the chance to point out this common mistake. Horror films, Warhammer 40K and 2000 AD comics are all famously dark, but they're for kids or teens. A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Importance of Being Earnest are light but grown-up. It's a weird deformation of the past generation to think that being depressing makes you deep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard disagree with a lot said here. Watched both the film and this series (though haven't got around to finishing it yet) for the first time last year, and the series lacks a lot of what makes the film great.The film has some interesting zen-like qualities like duality, and a more complex set of morals. The series just feels like most modern creations with a pretty bland right vs wrong.The film is also almost entirely practical effects, which are incredible (the behind the scenes footage is amazing), while the series leans a bit too heavily on CGI in parts, which detracts from the action a bit (à la LoTR vs The Hobbit).Given this piece I might go back to finish it now (and from another comment possibly upgrade my TV), but I still think I'll prefer the film.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't get into it. But whatever about me, the wife straight up hated it. She's not a fan of LOTR and it felt way too LOTR, story wise. You're supposed to love the (beautiful or cutesy) entities, hate the (ugly, so obviously evil) entities, and  care about wherever mysterious evil has gripped the land.  You're supposed to want the protagonists to go on a quest that brings you on a rollercoaster of emotions etc. But I don't really care enough about anyone in this to finish the first episode.My biggest gripe is that puppets have no facial expression, so this so-called "amazing voice acting" doesn't work for me. It feels like they're overacting to make up for lack of facial expression. Thing is, I've seen this work in shows like Yonderland where puppets make up less than 50% of the cast. If their human counterparts are good actors, the puppets interaction with humans work, especially if they have good lines and interesting characters (which, in the case of Yonderland, they do but with Dark Crystal they very much don't).It's odd, but I also think that the CGI and lack of any physical actors is what kills this for me. I don't know anyone in the acting profession but one example I can relate is the amazing "Yes, Minister" political comedy series from the BBC on the early 80s. That was originally available as a radio show. Having watched and loved it, I decided to put the radio version on one day while cleaning. I had to turn it off. Even though it was the same cast of great actors, I think the fact that they were sitting around a bunch of microphones and not inter-acting completely stunted the dialog. I decided to put on the TV version and simply listen to it. Even though there were visual gags I couldn't see, it was far far better. Something about being the characters in costume, on a set, interacting with other actors, injected vitality and comic timing into the performance. You could listen between the lines and feel the gags you couldn't see.I understand that a lot of time, effort, CGI went into this, but I just feel slapped in the face with beauty while not caring one jot about a single character. Or as the wife very uncharitably put it after 45 minutes "I hope all of these characters die in this".Sometimes there are adult shows that also appeal to kids. Sometimes there are shows that appear to be aimed at kids but are really aimed at adults. But this wants to be the latter and fails as either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43367401</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me the worst thing about being on-call is not the actual work outside business hours (it’s usually not much), but the potential work: if something happens I need to jump into my laptop within X minutes (changes from company to company, but it’s usually within 10 minutes). This means: I cannot go for a run, I cannot go to the movies, I cannot go for a dinner with family, I cannot even go shopping (shopping mall is further than a 10 min. trip). Basically, all I can do is stay at home and be available. It sucks, and the money is  not worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my experience working on SaaS, and improving ops at large organizations, I've seen that "on-call culture" often exists inversely proportional to incentive alignment.When engineers bear the full financial consequences of 3AM pages, they're more likely to make systems more resilient by adding graceful failure modes. When incident response becomes an organizational checkbox divorced from financial outcomes and planning, you get perpetual firefighting.The most successful teams I've seen treat on-call like a leading indicator - every incident represents unpriced technical debt that should be systematically eliminated. Each alert becomes an investment opportunity rather than a burden to be rotated.Big companies aren't missing the resources to fix this; they just don't have the aligned incentive structures that make fixing it rational for individuals involved.The most rational thing to do as an individual on a bad rotation: quit or transfer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a current SRE, and having worked in a small startup, this doesn't echo my experience at all. What the author describes is possible what we would call "on duty" work, the grunt/maintenance work that comes with big software systems. It's not fun, and most companies/teams have friction getting this sort of work done. It's also however not how my SRE role is defined by any stretch. Our on-call work is much more about support during exceptional, somewhat rare circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378671</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the plight of the axolotl, emphasizing its status as a critically endangered species due to habitat loss, pollution, and invasive species in its native environment in Mexico. It highlights the unique characteristics of the axolotl, such as its regenerative abilities and its appeal as a pet, contrasting its charming appearance with the harsh realities it faces in the wild. The piece advocates for conservation efforts to protect this remarkable amphibian and raise awareness about the broader environmental issues threatening its survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43373504"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other interesting things about axolots is they have what is called "neoteny" basically meaning the organism COULD proceed to adult form but never does - the natural axolotl is sort of a half-metamorphized creature for life, similar to a frog halfway through the tadpole-&gt;frog changes.  You can induce the transformation with thyroid-type hormone stimulation (thyroid  / TSH), which results in a salamander - essentially resurrecting this ancient morphology not seen in this world for a long time. 
Then the regenerative capabilities (seen in other amphibians as well) you can think of that as, "child humans heal better, what if the human is a child for life" in simplistic terms.  There are also tradeoffs the organism makes i.e. ability to reproduce at a younger age (reproduction evolutionary win), and notably, the histology and cellular structures are simplified and less complex than say mammals, thusly making body parts easier to regenerate. 
It's also notable that amphibians have massive genomes, the axolotl being 10x the size of humans! - but with about the same number of genes, why?  Well if mutations occur at random positions and you have ~10x more non-coding junk DNA, you've just lowered the frequency of mutations hitting coding genes, they are more likely to hit "safe" non-coding parts. All of this is important because if a mutation slips into the regenerated limb -&gt; cancer, so we're de-risking mutations by having a massive genome
https://www.mdpi.com/2221-3759/9/1/2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of the delightfully strange short story by the Argentinian writer Julio Cortázar:‘Axolotl’ is narrated by a lonely man who regularly visits the local zoo, where he becomes fascinated by the axolotls in the aquarium. In time, he states that he, too, is an axolotl, and feels he has become one of them.https://ambystoma.uky.edu/teachers_materials/axolitbook/Axol...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It has an impressive resume, being the most studied animal in the world, subject of more investigations than even the Drosophila melanogaster or common fruit fly that resides in thousands of laboratories around the world."It would be great to have a source for this claim! Recent studies have estimated that between 10 million and 110 million (it's controversial!) lab mice are used per year in the US, representing 93–97% of all experimental animals.https://www.science.org/content/article/how-many-mice-and-ra...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43373504</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;Wired has announced it will eliminate paywalls for articles related to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, allowing greater access to important investigative journalism. The decision aims to promote transparency and encourage civic engagement by making vital reporting available to everyone, regardless of their subscription status. The article advocates for other media outlets to adopt similar practices to enhance public access to crucial information and strengthen democratic accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m skeptical that this will improve the quality of reporting in an already under resourced journalistic environment. Maybe it’s a good idea, but it’s hardly obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among many other things that are seeing titanic shifts right now is the media landscape. Wired has been doing some excellent reporting on a lot of recent events while you have storied outfits like the Washington Post muzzled by their owner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised FOIA hasn't been "deleted" yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43399138</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of creating a universal AI query layer that can seamlessly integrate with various data sources, such as spreadsheets and databases. It highlights the challenges faced in connecting different data types and emphasizes the importance of developing a flexible AI system that can interpret and query data effectively across diverse platforms. The author proposes the use of new technologies and methodologies to enhance data accessibility and facilitate better decision-making by leveraging AI capabilities. Overall, the aim is to bridge the gap between user-friendly data management tools and powerful AI functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This abstraction shields users from the complexity of the underlying systems and allows us to add new data sources without changing the user experience.Cursed mission. These sorts of things do work amazingly well for toy problem domains. But, once you get into more complex business involving 4-way+ joins, things go sideways fast.I think it might be possible to have a human in the loop during the SQL authoring phase, but there's no way you can do it clean without outside interaction in all cases.95% correct might sound amazing at first, but it might as well be 0% in practice. You need to be perfectly correct when working with data in bulk with SQL operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My general method for things like this is to:1. Get a .dot file of the database. Many tools will export this.
2. Open the .dot in a tool I built for the purpose.
3. Select the tables I'm interested in, and export a subset of the .dot file representing just those tables and relationships.
4. Hand that subset .dot file to the LLM and say, "given this schema, write a query -- here's what I want: &lt;rest of the request here&gt;"That gets the job done 60% of the time. Sometimes when there's an incorrect shortcut relationship resulting in the wrong join I'll have to redirect with something like, "You need to go through &lt;table list&gt; to relate &lt;table X&gt; to &lt;table Y&gt;" That gets my success rate up above 95%. I'm not doing ridiculous queries, but I am doing recursive aggregations successfully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We (https://www.definite.app/) solved this a bit differently.We spin up a data lake and pipelines (we support 500+ integrations / connectors) to populate the data lake for you then put DuckDB on top as a single query engine to access all your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43361333</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The Git Who project is a tool designed to help users identify who contributed to specific lines of code in a Git repository. It provides a command-line interface that retrieves commit information, including the author and commit message associated with each line of a file. This tool aids developers in understanding code history and accountability, making it easier to track changes and contributions within collaborative software projects. Additionally, the project is open-source and encourages contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lovely tool. Thanks for the release! I had some fun with it before calling it a day.Here is my personal wishlist after a short test-drive.- Blame-based stats. While it is nice to see an overview of the historical contributions of Bob and Alice, this is not something that I would use on a daily basis. What would be more useful, is to present the same tables based on the blame lines of a tree-ish. This would show the de-facto "owner(s)" of modules/files, something which comes handy when asking for help with something or even assigning reviews. One could also run this iteratively over the history and get some nice timeline graph.- Support for pattern-based inclusions/exclusions. E.g. I am not interested to see stats on the json files used by tests. Or any kind of auto-generated files (e.g. django migrations).- Support for a configuration file, to store your preferred settings in your git repo. Something TOML-based perhaps.- Better packaging (nit). E.g. the linux tarball for v0.6 contains some apple-related "junk" and gnu tar complains about archive format incompatibilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a low-tech version of this, I have long had an alias (which I call "nerdwars") to "git shortlog -ns --no-merges" which just gives the number of commits by contributor from most to least.  It's a good way to get a sense for who the major contributors in a project are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, git blaming is really misunderstood by a lot of people; its NOT about who did it, its about which commit is to blame -- that's different.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43404548</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "On the Superiority of Pairwise Losses" discusses the effectiveness of pairwise loss functions in machine learning, particularly in ranking tasks. It critiques traditional pointwise approaches, highlighting that pairwise losses can lead to better performance by focusing on the relative comparisons between elements rather than absolute values. The authors present theoretical insights and empirical results that demonstrate how pairwise losses improve learning outcomes in various contexts, emphasizing their importance in enhancing model robustness and overall accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

This format is widely used to protect datasets against bitrot and small losses, but is held back because of the significant compute overhead when dealing with large datasets.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They're proposing "new hardware architectures" to take advantage of this idea.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope they have a robot for physically handeling the SD card insertions and retrieval. Even then, lets say you can load or swap 1 card per second, by the time you are dealing with the 200th card, would the first one not already be ingested?Seems like more of a scale out than a scale up problem, with a view on the whole operation from recording footage down to final archive to tackle the real bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One use case is to mount 360 cams on a bunch of motorcycles (fleet) and do a google streetview equivalent. You build a city level streetview pretty quickly.I think at that point you'd just need to do 1 pc every 200 readers and pull the videos to a local server for processing. There's no magic here, just work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it sounds boring, but did anyone suggest a second computer if this is an actual problem and not just a for fun challenge?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43361389</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been homeless and am now an employed engineer, so I know it’s possible to make the leap. You can’t make it in one go, though.Get a better job, that can get you stable housing. I don’t know the job market in your area, but try looking for temp agencies. They will do a basic interview and help you find something that uses your existing skills. Until you get stable housing and your basic needs met, focus on what you can do with the skills you have now.Seconding what others said about going to the library. In my community they serve almost as social workers, and have lists of places like food banks that can help you until you have better employment. Your county will also have resources for you; you can get on the waiting list for housing vouchers (they’re years long, but just in case), get food stamps, get leads for programs local to you.Yes, it’s possible to end up with a tech job. There’s a big gap between where you are now and there, though, and having stability in the short term will help you get there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ignore 95% of comments here. Research your options for local support through the government and religion. Religion may be more helpful in your area, even if your beliefs don’t exactly align. There is housing, food, etc available to you but you’ll likely need a social worker for help find it.https://switchpointcrc.org/ is local to you with food, shelter, etc.More info from a gov source: https://sgcityutah.gov/business_detail_T18_R270.phphttps://switchpointcrc.org/how-to-get-help/The local access points to the coordinated entry system provide the assessment, information and referrals, and other resources to the person seeking housing.Stop by or call for more information 948.N 1300 W. St. George, Utah 84770. 435-628-9310&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What would YOU do in my situation to break the cycle?I would start by getting in touch with extended family, friends, and anyone who trusts me enough to lend me a couch. Then I would make sure that my footprint on said couch was as small as possible. (IE, I'd make sure not to leave a mess.) Finally, I'd be very open about my search for employment so they're constantly assured that I'm actively working on becoming self-sufficient.For example, my cousin divorced her husband and put a restraining order on him. He ended up moving in with his first wife while he gets his life back together.---Assuming someone I know was in a similar situation, my ability to lend them my couch mostly depends on the risk they bring into my household. In the past, I avoided a college friend because he became a heroin addict. I'd give my nieces and nephews a lot of leeway in this situation; and the same for my cousins' children. Older cousins and adult friends would require closer understanding of the situation.I would seek to understand if alcohol, drugs, (or other vices like video games) contributed to the situation. Substance abuse is not something I want around my family, and it's not something I'm comfortable helping someone else manage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43402315</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a development approach known as "verification first," which emphasizes verifying code correctness before implementation. Hillel Wayne explores its benefits, arguing that this method can lead to higher quality software, reduced bugs, and overall better development practices. He shares insights on how this approach contrasts with traditional methods and provides a case for integrating formal verification techniques early in the software development lifecycle to enhance reliability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm all for splitting up the definitions of "test-first development" (TFD) and "test-driven development" (TDD), because I think for many forms of software development TFD is an anti-pattern that actively discourages people from writing tests.Unfortunately this article appears to want to treat TDD as a sub-set of TFD. I'd like to redefine TDD to mean "you bundle tests with your implementation when you commit to source control" - where it doesn't matter if you wrote the tests before or after the implementation.I write a lot of my tests after, often using snapshot testing. I get the key benefits of a robust test suite - protection against future changes introducing bugs that my test suite would have caught - but I don't go through the torment of trying to figure out how to test something that I've not yet even fully designed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once worked with a guy who took the opposite approach: I had a PR that made some simple changes to existing code to make it possible to test it. He refused to approve my PR, because he considered this cheating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's even better approach for big companies with huge budgets that need to get products right:Get validation team as an addition to your own tests.You start with specification and both teams - dev and val start developing parallelly.They'll develop their own tests, then review your code with huge focus on finding bugs, security issues and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43402102</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;StraySync is a mobile app designed to help pet owners keep track of their pets' activities and well-being. It allows users to monitor various aspects such as feeding schedules, exercise routines, and health records in a user-friendly interface. The app aims to enhance communication between pet owners and caregivers, making it easier to coordinate care and ensure pets are healthy and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one area where I'll actively discourage fragmentation of the existing ecosystem. Currently in the U.S. it's:1) PawBoost
2) Facebook Groups (which PawBoost usually posts to as well)
3) NextDoorPast that, the animal needs to be captured and checked for a chip. Having 10+ different apps to report lost animals essentially means there's zero point to posting to one in the first place, unless there is some distributed system they all would agree to operate on top of (maybe ATProto? idk).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat tangentially related, yet several posters mention other apps in a similar category.Is there a way to browse / search the app store from a desktop?  Every link just seems to go to an advertisement splash page, and search for "stray" does not even return the linked app.Found Lifestyle Apps [1] from StraySync's own "Lifestyle" category, yet only the top free apps to number 100 on desktop.  Does not appear to show "PawBoost" or some of the other mentions.[1] https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/lifestyle-apps/6012?...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea. Plenty of people everywhere keep an eye out for strays, and having an app to connect them would be valuable. The main issue is how to let them know that the app exists.Where I live, a slightly similar app (intended to connect lost pets with their owners) has found widespread local adoption. It is promoted by a local non-profit, so maybe partnerships with non-profits would allow you to find the audience that will appreciate something like this.Also, this needs an Android app. You need every user you can get to make it successful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43393198</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications and reasons for moving away from U.S. cloud services, highlighting concerns over data privacy, surveillance, and government regulations. It emphasizes the growing trend among organizations to seek alternatives, particularly in Europe, where data protection laws like GDPR provide stronger safeguards. The author outlines potential benefits such as improved data sovereignty, enhanced security, and increased control over data. The shift encourages organizations to consider local or regional cloud providers that align with their privacy values and compliance needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Wrapping up - Migrating away from US cloud services was easier than I expected.This is absolutely not the main takeaway and I find it difficult to see how he could write this - there are gaping holes. Git repos (it's too difficult). NPM (ditto). Startpage uses Google's index. The only meaningful switch he mentions is Proton, but as other comments have pointed out they have vendor lock-in problems. The real takeaway from this is that it's currently impossible in any meaningful sense. It feels like there's a real opportunity here for European companies to step up and make a big play, but will they? I really, really hope so. I'd jump ship in a heartbeat if I could.Edit: To be clear, the reasons in brackets were the author's, not mine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A shame that OP recommends Proton. The fact they don't support open email protocols like IMAP/SMTP without an extremely frustrating proxy setup is what ultimately turned me away from their service. Being able to "just" use a native mail client is pretty much a must.The vendor lock-in from something like Proton feels way worse as a result.Can't speak to Proton Pass, but it strikes me as a replacement that seems unnecessary: if Bitwarden is a problem, the server can be selfhosted, something which the OP seems to be familiar with.Some of the others feel of more... questionable issues to have with US cloud services; it's hard to find problems with Dockerhub and NPM that aren't just general problems with these services/the company behind them (mainly NPM). Maybe that's just because the public/private concern for both of those services is pretty different than the others mentioned here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting how for a (junior) dinosaur, like me, this was never a problem: I still run my mail, web, nextcloud, xmpp, forgejo, etc server on a former thin client under a cupboard. With a symmetrical fiber 1G connection it's been surprisingly reliable.FAQ:Yes, you can run self hosted mail.Yes, it's complex.No, it's not hard, but it takes time, as it is complex - if you want to understand it. If not, go for something like https://maddy.email/Yes, I have a fixed IP address with a reverse DNS entry configured.My ISP is zen.co.uk.Yes, I have reverse DNS, DKIM, DMARC, SPF, even mta-sts.No, I'm not switching from XMPP to Matrix - it's too server heavy, XMPP is more client oriented, which is my preference.I know about the UK's online safecty act, I used https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/ra_my_self_hosted_single_user_... as a template to create mine. I think the act itself is basically useless and just paperwork, but something along it's ideas is actually needed.I block many AI crawlers from accessing code and photos, as eg. Claude is so aggressive that it's code crawlers makes my system sluggish, and I have no will to let anyone use my photos beyond printing them for their wall as decoration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43396795</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reportedly removed several blogs that criticized AI technologies developed by major companies like Amazon and Microsoft. It raises concerns about censorship and the potential implications for free speech, particularly in the context of the growing influence of AI on various aspects of daily life and commerce.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the infamous incident that occurred 54 years ago, when a dead whale was exploded on an Oregon beach in an attempt to dispose of its large carcass. The event, which happened in 1970 near Florence, Oregon, was intended to provide a dramatic solution to the whale's disposal. However, it led to a comical disaster as chunks of whale blubber rained down on spectators and nearby properties, making it a memorable episode in local history. The piece reflects on the lasting impact of the event and its place in Oregon's culture, often referenced in discussions about wildlife and unconventional problem-solving techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

I think he said 20 sticks,"' Umenhofer recalled in 2015. "And I said, 'No he said 20 cases.'"&gt; It was indeed 20 cases of dynamite.Reminiscent of this letter by Evelyn Waugh to his wife during the Second World War:&gt; Darling...&gt; So No. 3 Cmdo were very anxious to be chums with Lord Glasgow so they offered to blow up an old tree stump for him and he was very grateful and he said don't spoil the plantation of young trees near it because that is the apple of my eye and they said no of course not we can blow a tree down so that it falls on a sixpence and Lord Glasgow said goodness you are clever and he asked them all to luncheon for the great explosion. So Col. Durnford-Slater D.S.O. said to his subaltern, have you put enough explosive in the tree. Yes sir, 75 lbs. Is that enough? Yes sir I worked it out by mathematics it is exactly right. Well better put a bit more. Very good sir.&gt; And when Col. D. Slater D.S.O. had had his port he sent for the subaltern and said subaltern better put a bit more explosive in that tree. I don't want to disappoint Lord Glasgow. Very good sir.&gt; Then they all went out to see the explosion and Col. D.S. D.S.O. said you will see that tree fall flat at just that angle where it will hurt no young trees and Lord Glasgow said goodness you are clever.&gt; So soon they lit the fuse and waited for the explosion and presently the tree, instead of falling quietly sideways, rose 50 feet into the air taking with it half an acre of soil and the whole of the young plantation.&gt; And the subaltern said Sir I made a mistake, it should have been 7.5 lbs not 75.&gt; Lord Glasgow was so upset he walked in dead silence back to his castle and when they came to the turn of the drive in sight of his castle what should they find but that every pane of glass in the building was broken.&gt; So Lord Glasgow gave a little cry and ran to hide his emotion in the lavatory and there when he pulled the plug the entire ceiling, loosened by the explosion, fell on his head.&gt; This is quite true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The blown up whale in Oregon is sort of like the SR-71 speed readout story. Reposted endlessly, but you just kind of accept it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the list of half considered excuses considered before landing on dynamite. They just wanted to use dynamite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43395658</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A former mentor gave me some valuable advice once about this that didn't make sense til years later. Basically, I got a computer science degree while working full time minimum wage - in a very competitive program and high cost of living area. It was extraordinarily hard, orders of magnitude harder than anything else I've ever done, just trying to survive and not starve and somehow find the time to do well in my studies.He said something like "if you keep burning the candle at 110% like you have been for long, you'll find that you often can find something deep within you to keep going, but eventually, this can run dry, and it doesn't really regenerate. It takes something from you that you aren't going to get back."I don't mean minor stuff like, "oh I'm really tired today and I don't want to go to school." I'm talking like, very difficult coursework + stressful job + major life calamities and personal loss all compiling at the same time in a way that you just want to crawl into a pit and die, yet, you keep going - that kind of willpower/stamina whatever you want to call it.He was right. I think he was alluding somewhat to burnout, which I think is related but somehow different - I am not the same person I was before that endeavor, and don't feel I really ever "healed" from it. It's very difficult to describe. feels a little like anhedonia, like a part of me has been missing since then. When I get in similar circumstances now, I find it harder to summon whatever it was inside of me that "kept going."I expect I'm still healing because I'm only ~10 years removed from this, but, sometimes I'm not sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is true.Focus = Energy - DistractionandSuccess = Focus x TimeThe way you gain stamina is by doing things to increase your energy and decrease distraction. I wrote and talked about this here, fwiw.https://vonnik.substack.com/p/state-changes-work-and-presenc...https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stokedlive_focus-is-power-lea...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of what Steve Jobs said: "Focus is about saying no". That resonates with me in that very often when I'm doing a task I was passionate on and now I'm not so passionate on it because there are 100 other things Id rather be doing. To have the stamina to persist by saying no to the other things is what gives people a huge advantage. "No, I won't stop running" or "No, I won't switch projects cause this shiny object is more interesting". I think having the stamina to keep persisting is a huge advantage, but it often comes at you saying no to all the other things you'd also like to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43398589</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept that "the model is the product," emphasizing the importance of the data model in the development of software and data-driven applications. It outlines how a strong data model serves as the foundation for effective data management and analysis, ultimately influencing the success of the product. The post also highlights best practices for creating robust data models and suggests that organizations should prioritize model design to ensure scalability, maintainability, and alignment with business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, author here.An important background is the imminent rise of actual LLM agents I discuss in the next post: https://vintagedata.org/blog/posts/designing-llm-agentsSo answering to a few comments:*The shift is coming relatively soon thanks to the latest RL breakthroughs (I really encourage to give a look at Will Brown talk). Anthropic and OpenAI are close to nail long multi-task sequences on specialized tasks.*There are stronger incentives to specialize the model and gate them. They are especially more transformative on the industry side. Right now most of the actual "AI" market is still largely rule-based/ML. Generative AI was not robust enough but now these systems can get disrupted — not to mention many verticals with a big focus on complex yet formal tasks. I know large network engineering co are upscaling their own RL capacities right now.*Open source AI is distanced so far due to lack of data/frameworks for large scale RL and tasks related data. Though we might see a democratization of verifiers, it will take time.Several people from big labs reached out since then and confirmed that, despite the obvious uncertainties, this is relatively one point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So what is happening right now is just a lot of denial. The honeymoon period between model providers and wrappers is over.
&gt; In short the dilemma for most successful wrappers is simple: training or being trained on. What they are doing right now is both free market research for the big labs but, even, as all outputs is ultimately generated through model providers, free data design and generation.This is a great observation on the current situation. Over the past few years, there's been a proliferation of AI wrappers in the SaaS space; however, because they're use proprietary models, they become entirely dependent on the model providers to continue to offer their solution, there's little to no barrier to entry to create a competing product, and they're providing free training data to the model providers. Instead, as the article suggests, SaaS builders should look into open source models (from places like Github, HuggingFace, or paperswithcode.com) or consider researching their own, and training custom models if they want to offer long-term services to their users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The argument appears to be "last-mile" specialisation of AI models by massive-compute-companies will be entirely proprietary, and walled-off to prevent competitor extraction of data. And these scenario/domain/task specific models will be the product sold by these companies.This is plausible insofar as one can find a reason to suppose compute costs for this specialisation will remain very high, and the hardwork of producing relevant data will be done best by those same companies.I think its equally plausible compute will come down enough, and innovations in "post-training re-training" will occur, that you'll be able to bring this in-house within the enterprise/org. Ie., that "ML/AI Engineer" teams will arise like SEng teams.Or that there's a limit to statistical modelling over historical cases, that means specailisation is so exponentially demanding on historical case data production, that it cannot practically occur in places which would most benefit from it.I think the latter is what will prevent the mega players in AI atm making "the model the product" -- at the level they can specialise (ie., given the amount of data needed), so can everyone else.Perhaps these companies will transition into something SaaS-like, AI-Model-Specialisation-As-A-Service (ASS ASS) -- where they create bespoke models for orgs which can afford it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43397474</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Dream Machine from Cockroach and of course The Neverhood from Doug TenNapel are some fantastic prior art here.  TenNapel even reused his skills to make Armikrog two decades later.I wonder if the creators of these physically rendered games ever get together to talk shop, or even host a conference, on the topic of non-linear animation and storytelling.  It’s the sort of thing that I, as someone who merely consumes their content and is absolutely nowhere near being able to replicate their skill, would love to take part in.Comic-Con but for games done the hard way.  Thimbleweed Park, another remake in the animated adventure game genre, actually has a scene in it that’s based on a conference for real-life point-and-click games developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two disjoint comments:1. Film sets contain wild walls that can be easily removed to accommodate light and camera placement outside the space looking inwards. Wild walls in the dioramas could have prevented the necessity of cutting holes.2. Git is not the right SCM for the job. My first choice would have been Plastic a few years ago, but this got rolled into Unity DevOps after an acquisition. But it is meant to accommodate truly vast repositories (53GB isn't actually that big). The second best choice is SVN - yes, really.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lol, the technique directing the art. Now everywhere a observer behind the wall would love to peep, there is a picture or lamp in the diorama. Basically , the artstyle subconsciously went towards subconciius thriller/horrorhouse with that .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43364368</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a theater director and actor I spend a lot of time thinking about "charisma". What is it that makes some people interesting to look at, even when they're not doing anything?Physical attractiveness can play into it, but there are some very charismatic actors who aren't attractive. Acting skill plays into it, but often charismatic actors are only mediocre at "acting". It's commonly associated with confidence, but some charismatic actors have a habit of playing un-confident roles. (Which is not the same as a lack of personal confidence, but what is it they're doing that conveys both "confident" and "insecure" simultaneously?")It's often said to be about commitment, a sense that they're really "present" and really focused on you. That's certainly something we want actors to do: the more they care about their scene-partners, the more the audience will be drawn to both. (That's true even when the focus is based on a negative emotion, like hatred, but it has to be a really targeted kind of hate and not just a general anger.)I can teach a lot about the theory of acting, but I have only a vague idea of why it works. When it does, it can be really potent, though it can be be incredibly hard to get. People will often do the same wrong thing harder. A lot of the silly acting games they teach are about getting you to at least do a different thing than what you were doing, hoping that somehow you'll accidentally discover the right track.I'm not sure any of this is really "charisma" in the sense that this writer means it. I certainly support his overall gist: soft skills are massively underrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author confuses simple likability for charisma. Charismatic people generally have a lot of likability, but not all likable people are charismatic.Charismatic people aren't just able to get people to like them, they are able to persuade people to adopt their viewpoint. When someone charismatic wants X to happen, you find yourself also wanting X to happen.This distinction matters, because the easy path to likability is agreeability: simply do what the people around you want you to do. They'll all like you, which is definitely valuable. But it won't necessarily get you closer to your goals.Charisma, which is a quite rare trait, has a special balance of likeability and dis-agreeability, where people will get on board with your plan and feel good doing it. It's the ability to increase their agreeability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is well meaning advice but it makes the mistake of believing the block to engineers attaining charisma is a lack of knowing how to do it. In reality, what you see is primarily an emotional reaction, where they find emotional justifications for why this advice is not right for them.I find what's often unacknowledged is just how much interest in technical matters is driven by a trauma response. A lot of us were unpopular as children or were ostracized for being weird and attaining mastery over an "objective" arena allowed us to feel better about our place in the world.Asking people like that to "just be charismatic" is asking them to depart from a safe space and enter into an arena they've previously associated with a lot of unpleasant emotions. People will act out in ways that feel are perfectly "rational" for them but are coming from places they're unable to explain because they're driven by more primal urges.For the advice to stick, you have to address the root cause which is the emotional, not the informational need. Otherwise, you're going to see the same well meaning advice go around in circles with only a minority of the field being motivated to act on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43401378</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Make one Ubuntu package 90% faster by rebuilding it and switching the memory allocator"i wish i could slap people in the face over standard tcp/ip for clickbait. it was ONE package and some gains were not realized by recompilation.i have to give it to him, i have preloaded jemalloc to one program to swap malloc implementation and results have been very pleasant. not in terms of performance (did not measure) but in stabilizing said application's memory usage. it actually fixed a problem that appeared to be a memory leak, but probably wasn't fault of the app itself (likely memory fragmentation with standard malloc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engineering is a compromise. The article shows most gains come from specialising the memory allocater. The thing to remember is that some projects are multithreaded, and allocate in one thread, use data in another and maybe deallocate in a 3rd. The allocator needs to handle this. So a speedup for one project may be a crash in another.Also, what about reallocation strategy?  Some programs preallocate and never touch malloc again, others constantly release and acquire. How well do they handle fragmentation?  What is the uptime (10 seconds or 10 years)?  Sometimes the choice of allocators is the difference between long term stability vs short term speed.I experimented with different allocators devoloping a video editor testing 4K videos that caches frames. 32Mb per frame, at 60fps, thats almost 2Gb per second per track.  You quickly hit allocator limitations, and realise that at least vanilla glibc allocator offers the best long term stability. But for short running benchmarks its the slowest.As already pointed out, engineering is a compromise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gentoo linux is essentially made specifically for people like this, to be able to optimize one’s own linux rig for one’s specific usecase.After initial setup, it’s pretty simple and easy to use, I remember making a ton of friends at matrix’s Gentoo Linux channel, was fun times.https://www.gentoo.org/Fun fact, initial ChromeOS was basically just custom Gentoo Linux install, I’m not sure if they still use Gentoo Linux internally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43406710</guid></item><item><title>2. fd: A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to 'find'</title><link>https://github.com/sharkdp/fd</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The website presents "fd," a simple and fast alternative to the Unix command-line tool "find." It offers a user-friendly interface with sensible defaults, the ability to search files and directories using regex patterns, and highlights matches in the output. Key features include support for viewing hidden files, integration with the "git" version control system, and colorized output for improved readability. The project is open-source and encourages contributions from the community. Detailed installation instructions and usage examples are provided to help users get started.&lt;/p&gt;

Ty you for making awesome software that i use DAILY.bat, fd, hexyl, hyperfineI'm going to take this moment to remind all of you well-paid engineers that if we each spread $10 a month sponsoring talented software makers like sharkdp the Internet would be a better place.So many great little tools out there and we should try to support an ecosystem for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if you want to try fd, bat, numbat, hexyl and hyperfine, you can install them quickly and see screenshots of them below on Terminal Trove:fd - https://terminaltrove.com/fd/bat - https://terminaltrove.com/bat/numbat - https://terminaltrove.com/numbat/hyperfine - https://terminaltrove.com/hyperfine/hexyl - https://terminaltrove.com/hexyl/we make a real effort to ensure that you can install them with the ability to see the screenshots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish fd and rg would align some of their flags. For example, both fd and rg have a --type, but for fd it means file/directory/symlink etc. For rg it means the file MIME type. Another example is that fd has an --extension flag, and rg doesn't.Since I believe the correlation of usage of these tools is high, I think they could benefit from having similarly named flags.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43410692</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage provides a detailed explanation of how daylight length varies throughout the year based on geographical location and time of year. It discusses the factors that influence daylight duration, such as the tilt of the Earth’s axis and its orbit around the Sun. Additionally, the site includes visualizations and interactive elements that allow users to explore the changes in sunrise and sunset times for different locations and dates, helping to illustrate the significant differences in daylight experienced in various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The writer had to attend a standup with a colleague in Norway to realize this and write an article. Funnily enough, as a Muslim I get reminded about this annually during Ramadan, which is right now.First of Ramadan this year coincided with March 1, and it was a 12:45 hours of fasting from the first light of dawn to sunset at my 
 location, also near Los Angeles. Today it's going to be 13:15 hours long, and by the time last of Ramadan rolls in around the end of March, it will be 13:37 hours.Ramadan is observed following the lunar calendar, which is shorter than solar- based calendars by about 10 days. A winter Ramadan is short and easy in the northern hemisphere and we will have the shortest days in 2031. 2047 it's going to be middle of summer, so the hardest.In case you ask, well what about places where sun does not set? When do you have your Suhoor (meal before dawn) and iftar (breakfast meal at sunset)? Opinions differ, but people usually follow the more realistic time of sunrise and sunset at a reference location. My brother in law was in Sweden few years back and he used the time of Mecca as reference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole "6am sunrise and 6pm sunset every day of the year" thing at the equator is kind of mind blowing.Another maybe counterintuitive fact is that (to a reasonable approximation) everywhere on earth gets the same number of hours of daylight over the course of a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When living in Stockholm, I came to appreciate the various levels of twilight and darkness, rather than thinking of day and night so strictly. The sun being low on the horizon also scatters light across the sky in ways that are very beautiful and last much longer than sunrise and sunset in Australia where I grew up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43413935</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Research as Leisure" discusses the concept of engaging in research activities not just for academic or professional purposes, but as a form of leisure and personal enrichment. It explores how pursuing research can provide intellectual stimulation, foster creativity, and enhance critical thinking skills, making it a rewarding and enjoyable pastime. The piece reflects on the benefits of cultivating curiosity and the joy of discovering new knowledge, framing research as a fulfilling hobby rather than solely a task to be completed for work or school.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read a fair amount and I actually do research as leisure all the time, but I can’t stand these elitist and unoriginal think pieces about how much better and cooler this person’s habits are than yours.&gt;&gt; for the leisurely researcher, self-study must include the discipline’s foundational textsI feel like this person has some kind of dark academia aesthetic fetish that they need to hold onto to feel superior to everyone else.I actually deeply agree with the advice in the OP around curiosity but personally I end up implementing it in a totally different way than they do.Lately I’ve found that LLMs are an amazing tool for this free-floating “research”- for example “Summarize the top three theories about why suburbs exist and who said them”. The LLM as open ended semantic search engine / research tool is an amazing way to figure out the topology of a subject you want to dive deeper into.I usually work my way down a content ladder from there to podcasts, wikipedia and finally to books.The idea that somehow civilization is ending because of our media consumption habits and that “reading source material” will save us comes off as more an aesthetic fantasy than a real-world complaint about today’s culture.I was around before the internet and I’m so thankful that so much more information is accessible now than it was when there were only books.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think reading is an essential skill, but we also need to get reading out of the pedestal. Because a lot of the time these arguments come across as some sort of literary elitism. Like if you're not ingesting information through reading, it doesn't count.This month I spent many hours listening to lectures on youtube about geopolitics on the Asian continent from the naval war college. Sure I could have read it, but nevertheless I got curious about a topic, engaged in it, and "followed the rabbit holes"I think there is a case to be made that we need to be more active in information seeking, rather than just being fed what the algorithm suggests you - on that topic Technology connections recently made a really good exposition of that issue -- https://youtu.be/QEJpZjg8GuA -- But it should not be about the method of ingesting information, but the quality and the intent of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started reading history as a hobby a few years after college when I heard some things from people that just didn’t make sense or didn’t seem true. So I picked up a booked that was well cited, read it while checking the citations after each chapter. Between the Library of Congress and Google, checking original sources has never been easier.It was a really mind blowing exercise. Much more interesting than fiction.When I do Bible study now I do it the same way, find whatever sources I can to cross reference with other history at the time. Strongly recommend it.What’s funny is that history is the subject I was least interested in all through school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43410061</guid></item><item><title>5.

I had trouble, for a moment, believing that it was not CGIed.Is there any information about what drone/camera equipment was used?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are certain historical inadequacies in the article."That is, the Apollo Program brought the country together in the turbulent 1960s and helped make everyone feel good about the country"This certainly was not 100% true, as some communities protested against Apollo program [1], even though, overall, the progress it has caused helped eventually those communities as well.Nevertheless there were kind of bipartisan agreement to push this program which, in current situation of the divide in the society, would be hard to achieve, given some program pitfalls, like the tragic catastrophe of Apollo 1, which killed Virgil Grissom, Edward Higgins White and Roger Chaffee (worth to not forget those people, who sacrificed their lives for humanity progress). Kennedy (and his wife) personality helped here a lot too, with some murky person, like Nixon, or someone featureless like Johnson it would've been more difficult.Also the claim that 1960s were turbulent is not really correct. In fact, 1970s were really turbulent with the rise of domestic terrorism [2][3].[1] https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/14/apollo-11-ci...[2] https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OPSR_TP...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_United_States&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't we just be happy that the astronauts made it safely back?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I joined a project last year which uses Konva inside an Angular application. It was my first time doing any kind of canvas programming, but the ergonomics of konva can be picked up quite rapidly and I've been enjoying quite a lot.We're working on performance-sensitive project, so one lesson we learned is that all shapes listen to all mouse events by default. We didn't even have lots of shapes, but this was enough to have a noticeable performance hit due to all the event handlers being registered. We pivoted to an opt-in approach instead and that fixed most of our problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't know about the library but the spreadsheet project built on top is impressive https://www.rowsncolumns.app/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I evaluated this vs pixi and native canvas API. In the end I decided to use native API.Konva didn't have enough performance for my use case and pixi webgl has a limit on the number of canvases on the screen at the same timeThe native API is easy to use and well documented. It also performs well enough to animate charts at 60fps on modern hw for my use case. I also like that there are no libraries to update&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43410988</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This highlights a thing I've seen with LLM's generally: they make different mistakes than humans. This makes catching the errors much more difficult.What I mean by this is that we have thousands of years of experience catching human mistakes. As such, we're really good at designing systems that catch (or work around) human mistakes and biases.LLM's, while impressive and sometimes less mistake-prone than humans, make errors in a fundamentally different manner. We just don't have the intuition and understanding of the way that LLM's "think" (in a broad sense of the word). As such, we have a hard time designing systems that account for this and catch the errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The LLM knows nothing about your requirements. When you ask it to do something without specifying all of the constraints, it will fill in all the blanks with the most probable answers from the universe of its training set. Maybe this is fine. But if you need something more custom, it’s up to you to actually tell the LLM about it.Reminds of the saying:“To replace programmers with AI, clients will have to accurately describe what they want.We're safe.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Preparatory Refactoring says that you should first refactor to make a change easy, and then make the change. The refactor change can be quite involved, but because it is semantics preserving, it is easier to evaluate than the change itself.&gt; In human software engineering, a common antipattern when trying to figure out what to do is to jump straight to proposing solutions, without forcing everyone to clearly articulate what all the requirements are. Often, your problem space is constrained enough that once you write down all of the requirements, the solution is uniquely determined; without the requirements, it’s easy to devolve into a haze of arguing over particular solutions.&gt; When you’re learning to use a new framework or library, simple uses of the software can be done just by copy pasting code from tutorials and tweaking them as necessary. But at some point, it’s a good idea to just slog through reading the docs from top-to-bottom, to get a full understanding of what is and is not possible in the software.&gt; The Walking Skeleton is the minimum, crappy implementation of an end-to-end system that has all of the pieces you need. The point is to get the end-to-end system working first, and only then start improving the various pieces.&gt; When there is a bug, there are broadly two ways you can try to fix it. One way is to randomly try things based on vibes and hope you get lucky. The other is to systematically examine your assumptions about how the system works and figure out where reality mismatches your expectations.&gt; The Rule of Three in software says that you should be willing to duplicate a piece of code once, but on the third copy you should refactor. This is a refinement on DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) accounting for the fact that it might not necessarily be obvious how to eliminate a duplication, and waiting until the third occurrence might clarify.These are lessons that I've learned the hard way (for some definition of "learned", these things are simple but not easy), but I've never seen them phrased to succinctly and accurately before. Well done OP!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43414393</guid></item><item><title>9.

That's M68k software. Accounting doesn't change. The only thing I've had to do is change the GST rate from 12.5% to 15% in 2010.I use print to PostScript for invoices and reports then copy them to the host machine (which these days can be anything) and PDF or print them.In theory Basilisk II would do the job, but SheepShaver runs PowerPC software too, and a modern CPU emulating PowerPC emulating 68k is just fine.I should try "II in a Mac" (from 1985) inside that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The name SheepShaver is a play on ShapeShifter, which was a Mac II emulator for Amiga. I remember running an Amiga Emulator (UAE) AND Shapeshifter on top of that since it was the best Macintosh Emulation at one point in the late 90s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love playing with SheepShaver (and BasiliskII and MinivMac).I created disk images for the various 68K/PPC Mac emulators that have not just my early game sources but the compilers/tools to build them (if you're into that sort of thing).The commercial games are here: https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreene...But I have a repo with the shareware games and two more repos of games that were never completed (and probably a third one coming when I get time to put it together).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sVfTPaxRwkAdditionally, while (pun intended) I am not religious about this, I try to avoid eating pork - as pigs are among the smartest animals humans eat (with intelligence comparable to dogs). For a similar reason, I avoid eating octopuses as well.Also, as a rule of thumb, "less meat is nearly always better than sustainable meat, to reduce your carbon footprint", https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always imagined the taboo originated in some practical reasons (like "pork spoils really quickly in the heat"), but or course that's simplistic, and trying to approach religious things with reasoned explanations is a fool's errand.This article's take is interesting: economic, environmental and cultural factors that gradually became codified as religious identity markers. The tribality of this tracks, the "us" vs "them" has always been and always will be, and people pick the most random things to differentiate the "us" from "them". It makes perfect sense that these desert tribes, indistinguishable cousins basically, would end up differentiating on something so arbitrary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graeber &amp; Wengrow's "The Dawn of Everything"[1] pulls the thread a bit about how groups tend to build their identity as oppositional to their neighbors - that a tribe who lives next to one known for its ornamentation will tend to develop a culture that spurns such things. This isn't the first thing I've read about some core part of Israelite identity coming as a strong rejection of their neighbors' way of doing things - there was an article here a while back digging into the prohibition against mixed fibers, as well, and an awful lot of the Levitican proclamations seem to be ways to establish a group identity in opposition to the cultures in which the Israelites found themselves embedded in. Even the concept of God - Reza Aslan (yeah yeah) traces the evolution of the concept of a local god of a people to the capital-G God of creation to early Israelites attempts to keep their culture intact in the face of a military defeat by their neighbors.1: https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-dawn-of-everything-a-new-hi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43410885</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day, the internet was an escape from the TV.It allowed access to information, alternative views (real ones not insane made up ones), no ads, and an escape from having to hear a dominant narrative.Now the internet has become the new TV. A lot of younger people I see are shunning it.That makes my old hacker heart smile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abandoning is not the answer.I see the effect with my father, he never got much into it in the first place and now he is completely lost when he need to order stuff. So many scammy website featuring first in Google result thanks to seo optimisation or just advertisement.Then he is completely oblivious to the fact that people can make deepfake video and believed one to be true when it was shown to him on someone else phone.As much garbage there can be on the internet, you have to force yourself to keep up with it and overall technology otherwise you're just left behind at the mercy of those who adapted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But I fear the cure may be worse than the disease, so much so that I penned a 25,000 word screed sketching the transformation of the Internet from an open network of peers to a locked-down medium for delivering commercial content to passive consumers.This part he got right, though he was clueless to the power of social media.  He also correctly predicted a rapid decline in the intelligence of content on the internet.However he was quite off the mark in predicting that hacking and spam would stop internet use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43409028</guid></item><item><title>12.

More pricing transparency would be good. A lot of smb, mine included, might not fit in starter, but also can't/won't spend more than we're spending with qb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's what I'd want from accounting software; a credible exit strategy that if you go bankrupt or decide that you need to tweak your pricing too much, I can take my data and run it on my own infrastructure. Have you thought about an open source business model? Even just offer the basic platform as open source (e.g. keep the AI stuff proprietary). Also, your pricing is too high; Xero offers a more generous starter plan for $20 / month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This would be super interesting as an open-core company. In particular, we would want direct access to the underlying SQL database and the ability to customize the code directly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43414405</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of memory safety in the context of font rendering in web browsers, specifically highlighting the measures implemented in Chrome to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with font handling. It explains how memory safety issues can arise from the complexities of font formats and how the Chrome development team has adopted strategies such as using secure coding practices and leveraging modern programming languages to enhance security. The post also emphasizes ongoing efforts to improve the robustness of the browser against potential exploits tied to font processing, ensuring a safer browsing experience for users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Merely keeping up with the stream of issues found by fuzzing costs Google at least 0.25 full time software engineersI like this way of measuring extra work. Is this standard at Google?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope that if we switch away from FreeType, we'll still have a way to use TTF hinting instructions fully.Windows/macOS don't seem to have a way to enable proper hinting anymore [0], and even FreeType (since 2.7 [1]) defaults to improper hinting (they call it "subpixel hinting", which doesn't make sense to me in theory, and practically still seems blurry, as if it's unhinted).In case anyone's wondering what properly hinted text looks like, here's a screenshot [2]. This currently relies on setting the environment variable `FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=truetype:interpreter-version=35`, possibly some other configuration through fontconfig, and using a font with good hinting instructions (eg, DejaVu Sans and DejaVu Sans Mono in the screenshot).My suspicion is that Windows moved away from font hinting after XP because it's very hard to create fonts with good sets of hinting instructions (aiui, OTF effectively only allows something like "autohinting"), so in the modern world of designer fonts it's easier to just have everyone look at blurry text. Some other minor reasons would be that UI scaling in Windows sometimes (or always?) introduces blurring anyway, and viewing raster images on screens of varying resolutions also introduces scaling blur.[0] Windows still has a way to enable it, but it disables antialiasing at the same time. This is using an option called "Smooth edges of screen fonts" in "Performance Options"). This basically makes it look like XP, which imo is an improvement, but not as good as FreeType which can do hinting and antialiasing at the same time.[1] https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/hinting/subpixel-hinting...[2] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Maxdamantus/3a58d8e764b29...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the true power of Rust that many are missing (like Microsoft with its TypeScript rewrite in Go): a gradual migration towards safety and the capability of being embedded in existing project.You don't have to do the Big Rewrite™, you can simply migrate components one by one instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43413125</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; if the baseline chance of delay is 10%, engineering works add 25%, strikes add 35%, and bad weather adds 20%, then when all these problems happen, there's a 90% chance your train will be delayed.What if signal failures "add" 15%? Then all factors combined would mean that there's a 105% chance your train will be delayed!Adding up probabilities like this doesn't make sense. If you simplify these things as independent events, the probability of delay is just the 1 minus the product of all the probabilities of each event not happening (i.e., 1 - P(event)).As for the article---I think you really undervalue your time and the price of inconvenience. I can see how you can romanticize it as a nice way to get things done, but (dealing with) train delays is hardly distraction free and is full of forced setting changes and (very) shit working environments (like waiting on a platform). This is a bad deal, even if it's free. Money is there to to be spent; this is a instance in which to spend it, moral/ethical/fraud concerns aside.But hey maybe you're a Von Neuman type and thrive in cacophony and chaos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Avanti West Coast offers customers:&gt;  15 minutes — 25% off&gt;  30 minutes — 50% off&gt;  1 hour + — 100% offTo me they look like very generous refund policies. I checked Italy's Trenitalia and what they offer is[1]:&gt; 30-119 minutes: 25%&gt; 120+ minutes: 50%I suppose anything below 30 minutes is consideres "on time".[1] https://www.trenitalia.com/it/informazioni/indennizzo_per_ri...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used a much simpler variant of this to get Amazon Prime for free for years. When I needed something off Amazon, I'd just wait until the day before it was going to rain then order it with next day delivery. The couriers at that point in time seemed comically unable to deliver anything if it rained. Once it arrived late, open a case and ask for a month of free Amazon prime. This worked up until they discontinued that as a potential compensation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378587</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Estonia have utilized muons—subatomic particles that penetrate materials—to assess the condition of a road bridge. This innovative technique allows for non-invasive inspection, revealing internal structures and potential damage without the need for extensive physical examination. The study aims to enhance bridge safety and maintenance by providing a more efficient and effective evaluation method that could be applied to other infrastructure as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video game workers in North America have successfully formed an industry-wide union, marking a significant milestone in the labor movement within the gaming sector. This unionization aims to address long-standing issues such as job security, fair wages, and better working conditions that many employees in the industry have faced. The initiative is seen as a response to the growing concerns over the treatment of workers in the gaming world and seeks to empower employees by providing them with collective bargaining power. This development reflects a broader trend of unionization efforts across various sectors, highlighting the demand for improved labor rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43411934"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This is a direct-join union, meaning that workers can sign up on their own. This allows folks to bypass traditional unionization processes like elections and employer consent.Good reminder that the word "union" is overloaded and doesn't always mean what you might assume.People who join a union like this don't have union representation or union contracts with companies. They rely on individual members to take action in various forms within there own companies. In theory they could call for a strike and ask everyone who is a member to strike from their respective companies, but in practice it's more about raising awareness and making noise in hopes of driving change.So while technically it's a union, it's not comparable to what most people think of as a union in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just my opinion. I have no experience working in the industry _for someone else_. I am, however, working on my own game (3+ years). I'm not a believer in poor work environments, as I don't think that environment maximizes creative output. I know what it's like working with less than 7 hours of sleep, or sitting in front of a screen hours on end. It dulls the mind. It's like being half alive.All that said: A hit based industry is not one that provides stability. I cant think of how slapping a union on top of an unstable foundation is going to solve anything. I've heard a couple people who crossed over from the film industry say it's just going to turn most roles into contracts (just like the film industry), and will quickly filter out the unskilled and less driven people.There isn't really a solution to this. Market pressure keep the prices of games down. Funding gets a better bang for buck by investing in up and coming countries (e.g. Poland). Most qualified[1] games don't even break a million. Hitting [just!] $150,000 in revenue is when Steam starts seriously promoting your game[2]. $150K is not even enough to live in a coastal city (after dev. costs), never mind hiring people.[1] The dev had the intent to market _and_ sell a legitimate product, which is the minority of games on steam.[2] howtomarketagame.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fantastic news and something we need very much!When my studio was closed and 36 of us fired without notice 7 months ago, I poked around at union options and was shocked to find they were only inside individual studios, not even across whole companies, much less across the industry.The games industry is 100 years behind film and music in standardizing contracts, roles, and rights (including IP rights for failed projects). This initiative gives us a chance to fix it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43411934</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The web site of this LARP has good video.[1] They did a very good job on this.
Here's the prep material for players.[2] It's intense. 48 hours with no breaks.It's hard to scale location-based entertainment. 
Disney tried the Galactic Starcruiser themed hotel, but it was a dud. Too expensive - $5000 or so for 2.5 days. It was a LARP dumbed down to Disney park customer level.
Lots of mini-games, not much coordinated activity.That's about how this sort of thing usually goes. Keeping everybody on script in coordinated activity is tough. I was involved with steampunk conventions, pre-COVID. Those took elaborate prep, but there was no all-player coordinated event.The US has some events like this. Wasteland Weekend. The Society for Creative Anachronism. Military reenactment groups.[1] https://www.odysseuslarp.com/[2] https://www.odysseuslarp.com/blog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because I see people asking, some groups that do things like this in the US:https://reverie.studio/https://grimmoire.productions/https://www.journeysandtales.net/https://www.drachenfest.us/https://www.jackalope-larp.com/https://www.sinkingshipcreations.com/https://larpcoop.regfox.com/shirefolkOr at lower production values:https://makeascenemn.org/en/http://www.interactiveliterature.org/NEILhttps://2025.beconlarp.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would desperately love to do something like this. Either as a participant or as an organizer. Honestly, if anyone wants help in my local area (denmark) or remote help organizing web stuff or part design/3d sculpting for 3d printers id be happy to donate some time.I had heard of similar things in the UK, fantasy stuff. and also Evermore park in the US which was like an even more ambitious theme-park sized one that had a continuous ongoing story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43414992</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper primarily considers house prices and quantities in terms of single-family homes. They use data sources like the single-family repeat-sales index and the median home value from the American Community Survey, which mostly tracks single-family homes.This focus limits their analysis by not fully accounting for multi-family housing units or rental markets, which are far more significantly impacted by supply constraints.This emphasis on single-family homes in their data sources affects the generalizability of their conclusions about the impact of supply constraints across different types of housing markets, especially in dense urban areas where multi-family units and rentals are more prevalent.They also only go as far back as 1980. The difference between supply constraints between 1980 and 2025 is very small compared to the difference between 1965 and 1980. Take Los Angeles as an example [1]. The zoned capacity of many metro areas was dramatically reduced by the mid 1970s.[1] https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The American/western aristocracy has nearly perfectly entrenched their power with housing policy.Housing is the major wealth store for the middle and lower class. Most in the middle and lower class will spend major portions of their income on this for many years of their life.If supply goes up, then the middle and lower class loses significant amounts of their wealth immediately since buyers have more options. If supply goes down or fails to keep up, then housing becomes increasingly unaffordable and the wealth of people who already own goes up.What's best for society is if everyone who's wealth is tied up in property takes a hit to their wealth so that housing becomes affordable and loses it's status as primary wealth store, but that would be devastating in the short term to the middle class and therefore completely politically untenable.So because housing policy discussion takes place under these conditions, it's nearly impossible to have a reality based discussion because almost everybody loses except societies richest."Housing can either be an investment or affordable."Almost everyone in any position of power or with institutional reputation has an extremely vested interest in both keeping the broken status quo and convincing people that absolutely anything other then basic economic theory of supply and demand is chiefly responsible for housing prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scanning the paper, I don't see an answer to the first question I have if I assume their basic premise (that house price growth correlates to income growth): is the actual profit on home construction constant (or even shrinking)? One would assume it would be, if their data also controlled for confounding factors like regulatory limits, economic stagnation, etc.In other words, it is my position that the burden of proof should rest on people who claim that the laws of supply and demand fail to explain what the obstacle is to equilibrium in the market they're studying: why if I increase supply does price not come down? My instinct is that it's just more expensive to build homes on the same profit margin than it was over 40 years ago, when their data sampling begins. I don't believe that the real estate industry suddenly had a collective awakening to greed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43411258</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the case of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian woman who was detained by U.S. immigration authorities despite being a long-term resident of Canada. It highlights her experiences in detention, including the challenges she faced in navigating the U.S. immigration system. The piece raises broader concerns about the treatment of migrants and the complexities surrounding immigration policies, urging for reforms and more humane treatment of individuals in similar situations. Mooney's situation exemplifies the increasing scrutiny and issues related to cross-border migration between Canada and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is horrible and scary, why border guards are even giving the authority to revoke visas is beyond me. When people think about giving cops/guards authority like this they need to be picturing the dumbest bully from their grade school.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations" introduces a novel approach to defining and training deep learning models using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The authors propose a framework in which a continuous-time process is modeled as the solution of an ODE, allowing for adaptive computation graphs and more efficient training of deep networks. This results in a flexible model that can represent a wide range of dynamics and can seamlessly integrate with existing deep learning frameworks. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Neural ODEs on various tasks, showing improved performance and efficiency compared to traditional neural network architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

In fourier analysis or other frequency/wavelet decomposition techniques, the data you get out depends a ton on the windowing function that you use.For example:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_functionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function#Examples_of_wi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of further potential interest:  This paper cites an earlier paper by Keogh and Lin with the provocative title "Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless", available online at https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/meaningless.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper ignored a big honking chunk of the field, as is used in finance often - you take the delta between adjacent timepoints, something like the derivative, now  you have something centered on zero and going up and down "randomly".  Something like PCA also typically may use centering although that's not exactly the same.  I would have loved to see an investigation of window size and such and deltad time series (usually either x2-x1, or x2/x1).  In this sense the paper is just recapitulating, "if you don't delta your time series bad things happen"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43411898</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I follow Mr. Huang, read/watch his content and also plan to use PocketFlow in some cases. A preamble, because I don't agree with this assessment. I think agents as nodes in a DAG workflow is _an_ implementation of an agentic system, but is not the systems I most often interact with (e.g. Cursor, Claude + MCP).Agentic systems can be simply the LLM + prompting + tools[1]. LLMs are more than capable (especially chain-of thought models) to breakdown problems into steps, analyze necessary tools to use and then executing the steps in sequence. All of this is done with the model in the driver seat.I think the system described in the post need a different name. It's a traditional workflow system with an agent operating on individual tasks. Its more rigid in that the workflow is setup ahead of time. Typical agentic systems are largely undefined or defined via prompting. For some use cases this rigidity is a feature.[1 https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-us...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey folks! I just posted a quick tutorial explaining how LLM agents (like OpenAI Agents, Pydantic AI, Manus AI, AutoGPT or PerplexityAI) are basically small graphs with loops and branches. For example:OpenAI Agents: for the workflow logic: https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/48ff99bb...Pydantic Agents: organizes steps in a graph: https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/4c0f384a0626299...Langchain: demonstrates the loop structure: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/4d1d726e61ed5...If all the hype has been confusing, this guide shows how they actually work under the hood, with simple examples. Check it out!https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/llm-agent-internal-as-a-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is hard to put a pin on this one because there are so many thing wrong with this definition. There are agent frameworks that are not rebranded workflow tools too. I don't think this article helps explain anything except putting the intended audience in the same box of mind we were stuck since the invention of programming - i.e. it does not help.Forget about boxes and deterministic control and start thinking of error tolerance and recovery. That is what agents are all about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43417511</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because I collect definitions of "agent", here's the one this book uses:&gt; An agent is something that acts in an environment; it does something. Agents include worms, dogs, thermostats, airplanes, robots, humans, companies, and countries.https://artint.info/3e/html/ArtInt3e.Ch1.S1.htmlI think of this as the "academic" definition, or sometimes the "thermostat" definition (though maybe I should call it the "worms and dogs" definition).Another common variant of it is from Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell's classic AI text book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach": http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/4th-ed/pdfs/newchap02.pdf&gt; Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a few more definitions of agents:Agents are a coupling of perception, reasoning, and acting with preferences or goals. They prefer some states of the world to other states, and they act to try to achieve the states they prefer most (this book)AI agents are rational agents. They make rational decisions based on their perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results. An AI agent senses its environment with physical or software interfaces (AWS)An artificial intelligence (AI) agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools (IBM)Agents are like layers on top of the language models that observe and collect information, provide input to the model and together generate an action plan and communicate that to the user — or even act on their own, if permitted (Microsoft)Assumptions:Focus on rationality vs. goal-seeking vs. autonomyWhether tool use is emphasizedArchitectural specificityRelationship to usersDecision-making framework (optimality vs. preference satisfaction)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To add to the mix, agents are nominally proactive, rather than a tool wielded by someone.  This (again nominally) means having goals, although the goals can often be in the observer's mind rather than the agent itself. Reasoning with goals is trivial for humans but the algorithms get hairy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378226</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TS doesn't seem to provide for a way to modify return values for the function. For example the following is a common pattern in Go using defer to ensure that errors closing a writeable file are returned:    func foo() (retErr error) {
        f, err := os.Create("out.txt")
        if err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("error opening file: %w", err)
        }
        defer func() {
            err := f.Close()
            if err != nil &amp;&amp; retErr == nil {
                retErr = fmt.Errorf("error closing file: %w", err)
            }
        }()
        _, err = f.Write([]byte("hello world!"))
        return err
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author takes great care to rebut a common theme among objections to the proposal - “this isn’t necessary if you just write code better”. I am reminded of this fantastic essay:&gt; If we flew planes like we write code, we’d have daily crashes, of course, but beyond that, the response to every plane crash would be: “only a bad pilot blames their plane!”&gt; This doesn’t happen in aviation, because in aviation we have decided, correctly, that human error is an intrinsic and inseparable part of human activity. And so we have built concentric layers of mechanical checks and balances around pilots, to take on part of the load of flying. Because humans are tired, they are burned out, they have limited focus, limited working memory, they are traumatized by writing executable YAML, etc.&gt; Mechanical processes are independent of the skill of the programmer. Mechanical processes scale, unlike berating people to simply write fewer bugs.(https://borretti.me/article/introducing-austral#goals)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding the statements on golang's defer:  "the defer call is hoisted to the outside of the for loop in func work"

Astonishing.  Add that to the list of golang head scratchers.  That is one of the biggest "principle of least astonishment" violations I've ever seen.Disclaimer: Not a golang hater.  Great language.  Used it myself on occasion, although I remain a golang neophyte.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses selective asynchronous commits in PostgreSQL as a means to enhance performance while maintaining data durability. It explains the concept of asynchronous commits, where transactions can be acknowledged before being fully written to disk, allowing for faster execution. The author analyzes various scenarios where selective use of asynchronous commits can be beneficial, weighing the trade-offs between data safety and system efficiency. The piece also reviews implementation considerations, configuration options, and potential use cases for database administrators seeking to optimize performance without compromising on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suspect many apps would benefit from splitting the commit completion notification into two pieces:- commit logically committed (meaning it won't fail to complete for any reason other than power or hardware failure, and in particular no trigger or other such logic can keep it from completing)- commit completed durably (i.e., all associated writes have reached stable, persistent storage, and future reads will see them even if there is a power failure in between)A UI could indicate that a transaction is logically complete and have a second way to indicate that the transaction is durably committed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're careful and you know what you're doing, sure. A much more impressive speed boost is to not use Aurora. "Let us separate storage and compute with a minimum latency of 1 msec," said no sane person ever.Go spin up vanilla Postgres on an i4i instance, or even your personal computer, assuming you have a fast NVMe drive. You'll see what fast is. Nothing comes remotely close, not even io2 Block Express. A modern enterprise NVMe drive can do over 1,000,000 IOPS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn’t know this could be per-session or per-transaction. That seems a way better way to take advantage of this for very carefully thought-through use-cases without setting up an invisible footgun in a global setting someone else doesn’t realize is changed from the default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43380622</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool to see my favorite band discussed here. One of my passion projects for the past 13 years has been running Phishin' [1], a free, legal, open source [2] website and API for discovering and streaming their music as recorded by the audience.[1] https://phish.in
[2] https://github.com/jcraigk/phishin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The business of the Phish shakedown is an interesting read too.  Ice cold fatties..https://www.villagevoice.com/inside-the-nitrous-mafia-an-eas...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who could reasonably be considered an expert in Phish, as well as someone who built their own indie business, I can confidently say no book, business, or entity influenced my business more than Phish. Phish is a business, but they are more accurately defined as a creative conduit for the four members to sustainably make music. Their goals were to work incredibly hard (both in front of an audience and away from them), grow sustainably, and perform live music. They, by and large, treat their fans right and focus on crafting incredible live experiences. Their interviews are gems for those pursuing creative work who are obsessed with process, intent, and improvement.Their business changed drastically in 2009, when they came back from an extended hiatus. The business side of things had burned them out and they pared down their internal organization to ~3-4 people and outsourced most of it to some close friends (an external management team), so they could focus on the music and their families. Whereas in their first 20 years they were far more fan-friendly and even anti-consumerism (they regularly covered up the advertisements in hockey arenas when playing there), the band's business has since become far more profitable and extracting, though not necessarily to an obscene extreme. The band members have mostly removed themselves from the business side and focus on the creative - a role that lets them keep rolling, but sometimes at the cost of fan-friendliness. It's worth noting that they are incredibly philanthropic, and have donated immense money to environmental, educational, and drug-treatment efforts.Overall they are a masterclass in running a well-balanced organization that is both a capitalistic business as well as a down-to-earth creative organization and I have no doubt each and every one of us could glean a lesson or two from the way they built their structure over years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43413478</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of passkeys as a modern alternative to traditional passwords for securing online accounts. It explains how passkeys utilize public-key cryptography to enhance security by eliminating the need for password input, therefore reducing the risk of phishing and credential theft. The piece highlights the advantages of passkeys, such as ease of use and improved user experience, along with guidance on their implementation across various devices and platforms. The overall goal is to advocate for a shift towards adopting passkeys as a standard practice for authentication, emphasizing their potential to significantly enhance digital security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;since not stated in the article and I started to get worried, this was reported last year.Safari: fixed in 18.3 (Jan 2025)Firefox: fixed in 136 (March 2025)Chrome: fixed in 130.0.6723.58/.59 (Oct 2024)Wow - only Google seemed to really prioritize fixing this / had the processes and manpower to get a fix out quickly.Mozilla’s bug report is still locked down but Google’s is open: https://issues.chromium.org/issues/370482421&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice find.To me it seems that WebauthN/PassKey was a significant project where all of the clever and highly paid engineers from the big corporations took part.How can they overlook such an attack vector? Especially when the main selling point for the new technology is "resistance against phishing"?Even MS has in their FAQ: Are "Q: passkeys phishing resistant? A: Yes, passkeys are phishing resistant" [1][1] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-frequen...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I understand it correctly (I had some trouble wrapping my head around the exact attack vector):The problem here is that browsers allow redirecting users to the installed passkey implementation/"backend" in the same way that camera and dedicated QR scanner apps legitimately use to initiate cross-device authentication via (what used to be called) caBLE, right?In other words, the attacker primes the user for an upcoming authentication on-device authentication, but in reality initiates an off-device authentication to their own device.And the fix is presumably to not accept off-device authentication intents over anything that's not a QR scan, or at least filter them out in the browser?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43408674</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rare to see news about Azerbaijan on HN—glad this one made it to the top! If you haven’t been to Baku or Azerbaijan, definitely add it to your travel list. These days, many skilled Azerbaijanis contribute across various sectors in Europe and beyond. If in the past we were mostly known in Russia for bringing fresh tomatoes and produce from sunny Baku, today’s generation is more globally aware and engaged in tech, finance, and many other fields.Also, if you have an Azerbaijani friend, don’t hesitate to celebrate Nowruz with them today/tomorrow—and Ramadan later this month! Salute to all former compatriots who went abroad in pursuit of a better life and a better version of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But the image of the city (even if they occasionally visit) gradually becomes more blurred and erased over time, and slowly, on their mental map, only a few places remain—those associated with something personal. A few backdrops where various events in their lives unfolded.This is so true, even for small hometowns. Yet I recognize that these old places while seeming listless to me and my cohort now as we have all moved on and our old haunts are closed or transformed, are very much alive to the young generations now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43396076</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of decoding JSON data into sum types in Go, highlighting the flexibility and complexity involved in handling different data structures. It explains the concept of sum types, also known as discriminated unions or tagged unions, and provides practical examples of how to implement them in Go using the `encoding/json` package. By demonstrating how to properly manage type assertions and JSON unmarshalling, the article aims to offer readers a clear understanding of the approach and help them effectively work with JSON in Go applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43376769"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IME this is a longstanding pain point with Go. There's an attempt to propose an encoding/json/v2 package [1] being kicked around at the moment [2], spawned from a discussion [3].This at least seems to improve the situation of marshalling to/from an interface directly slightly by providing the ability to pass custom Unmarshalers for a specific type (via json.WithUnmarshalers and json.UnmarshalFunc) to the Unmarshal functions, but it appears to still have the inefficient double-decode problem. Or I just haven't found a decent way around it yet.Looks like they're intentionally punting on a first class solution until (if) the language gets some sort of sum type, but I still think the second-class solution could do a bit more to make this extremely common use-case more convenient. Pretty much every serious production Go app I've worked on in the last 10 years or so has had some horrible coping strategy for the "map a field-discriminated object to/from implementations of an interface" gap, often involving some sort of double-unmarshal.Quote from the proposal [1]:&gt; First-class support for union types: It is common for the type of a particular JSON value to be dynamically changed based on context. This is difficult to support in Go as the equivalent of a dynamic value is a Go interface. When unmarshaling, there is no way in Go reflection to enumerate the set of possible Go types that can be stored in a Go interface in order to choose the right type to automatically unmarshal a dynamic JSON value. Support for such use cases is deferred until better Go language support exists.  [1]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-json-experiment/json
  [2]: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/71497
  [3]: https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/63397&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool but all you really needed to do was fix the contract between NewActionDeleteObject’s struct creation and the switch statements result = print. What’s really crazy is you can create anonymous structs to unmarshal json without having to fully flesh out data models thanks to its “we’ll only map the fields we see in the struct” approach. Mapstructure takes this even further with squash. In the end, the type checker missed the error because it was user error by contract and that, due to lack of validation that the actions were constructed properly, resulted in a rabbit hole debugging session that ended with an excellent blog post about the gotchas of unmarshaling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW double unmarshalling (and double marshalling) can be quite slow, so to speed up determining the object type you can extract the type field e.g. by using gjson (https://github.com/tidwall/gjson). It can be easily 10x faster for this kind of scenario&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43376769</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the future direction of Fauna, a serverless database solution designed for modern applications. It emphasizes the company's commitment to simplifying data management across various cloud environments and highlights ongoing enhancements aimed at improving performance, scalability, and user experience. Fauna's vision includes promoting developer productivity through innovative features and capabilities, leveraging the power of data with greater flexibility, and responding to evolving market demands. The focus is on creating a robust platform that supports diverse use cases while maintaining a strong developer-centric approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a Fauna customer and also worked with them providing technical writing for their blog and docs. At one point I was even contacted by a publisher to write a book about Fauna.I don't know what happened internally but when they accepted VC money and put a new CEO it all started to go down, fast. They probably started focusing on selling to corps instead of devs which seemed illogical IMO. Corps bring more money but at the time it was clear to me that Fauna would never be able to compete in with on-prem SQL-heavy kind of environments.Fauna made sense as a secondary database for certain use cases that needed to be global... but who would use a high risk database with no fallback as their main database? Maybe small projects but definitely not big companies/products.A decade ago it seemed that edge computing, serverless, and distributed data was the future. Fauna made a lot of sense in that vision. But in these years since, experimenting with edge stuff, I've learned that most data doesn't really need to be distributed. You don't need such a sophisticated solution to cache a subset of data for reads in a CDN or some KV. What I'm saying is that, probably, Cloudflare Workers KV and similar services killed Fauna.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We were Fauna users for several years and invested a lot of time working with it and around it. The time travel capability was one of the stand out features for us in addition to FQL which opened some interesting capabilities. That being said for various reasons we had to transition away from it and did so by creating a FQL compatible solution on top of Postgres. It is implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript and runs in Postgres through the plv8 extension. Is this something that would be interesting to other current users?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a very tough announcement for any customers relying on the Fauna service. The announcement itself hides the all key details, clicking into the FAQ reveals the date is not several months away but in fact 2 months 11 days away, and there is no FaunaDB open source release to start saving your own ass today.&gt; we have made the hard decision to sunset the Fauna service over the next several months.  clicks into the FAQ

On motorbike the box rests in the back of the seat but here all the weight is in the shoulders.People who have done some mountain hiking knows that the weight of the backpack should be mostly in the waist, thanks to the waist belt (sorry if I don't use the right term, I've done most my hiking in Spanish ;) ).I don't know how weight distribution would differ from walking but with some research perhaps they could carry more while staying more comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over here in Bengaluru,  our quick commerce folks seem to prefer Yulu bikes.They are small, nimble, low powered electric scooters with a decent carrying capacity, whose biggest advantage is _cheap_.If you ask anyone other than the delivery folks, the yulu drivers are a menace, as they break the already fragile equilibrium that is Bengaluru traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43379235</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The docs have test cases embedded in the markdown. This is a pretty cool use of markdown. I have started doing something similar with markdown in my project. I wonder if other programming languages have done this too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could not tell if this is a hobby project, or the product of a research lab. Does anyone know? Very cool stuff. It would benefit from some institutional support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other programming languages this author has worked on:Droplet: "Datalog in time and space" - https://github.com/jamii/dropletEve: "Datalog meets Smalltalk" - https://witheve.comImp: "An Eve for people who build Eves" - https://github.com/jamii/impThese are some pretty "out there" languages with a high strangeness budget, so I'd expect the same of Zest.I like the idea of exploring the interaction models that Eve provided but instead with a "well-trodden ground of a mostly-familiar imperative language", but I'm curious how that will work since the interactions in Eve were made possible due to the datalog-like language design. So my initial question is how "mostly-familiar" Zest really is; what imperative concessions does the language make to gain which interactions?With Eve, a lot was gained just by keeping a database of compiler artefacts that would normally be thrown away. This allowed for a degree of "provenance" tracking, where you can ask the compiler how a runtime value came to be.I think there's an interesting middle ground where maybe we can get a bunch of the things in Eve that were nice, but maybe tone down the weirdness budget to lower the learning curve. Maybe that's Zest? Will be interesting to follow this project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43379082</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;Google has agreed to a settlement over claims that it unfairly favored white and Asian employees in its hiring practices while marginalizing Black and Hispanic workers. The allegations, which stem from a lawsuit, highlight a systemic bias in the company's recruiting and promotion processes. The settlement aims to address these disparities, taking significant steps to promote diversity and equity within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to do a KGB vs. CIA game for mobile. You choose a side, get assigned a code name. Then various assignments come your way requiring you to go to specific GPS locations not too far from you (dead drops) where you get instructions for the next mission.As you complete these tasks, in time you advance to assassin-level where you are sent to target and "kill" other players of the game. (Just getting within some near GPS distance of them and touching the "trigger" button in the game.)(I assume each player can geofence an area where they are "unassailable" — home, work? But, otherwise, yeah, someone could be stalking you through a grocery store to make a hit. Victim is sent a notification they are out of the game.)It's a game though without legs though until you have enough people playing to make the assassin stage possible.(Yes, based on the popular college game "Assassin" played IRL with rubber dart guns and dossiers on your targets. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the interest of making AR games safer:Is there a public database of dangerous intersections somewhere?It sure would be nice if we had AR games that forbid setting a new focal point in an area with pedestrian or vehicle fatalities.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Python's native data structures, such as dictionaries and lists, differ from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formats. It highlights that while Python can easily convert its data types to JSON using the `json` library, there are nuances and limitations to be aware of, such as data types that cannot be directly serialized into JSON (e.g., tuples, sets). The piece provides practical examples of serialization and deserialization processes, illustrating common pitfalls and best practices for handling data transformations between Python and JSON formats, ensuring compatibility and correct data representation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One design decision they made is that outputs are not stored. This means these notebooks are not suitable replacement for heavy computation routines, where the notebook is a record of the final results. Other people are not expected to run minutes/hours long computation to see what the author intended.You can work your way around it by storing the results in a separate file(s), and writing the boiler plate to let the reader load the results. Or they let you export to ipynb - which is still sharing two files.Presumably the reason for this decision is making git diffs short. But to me the solution is to fix git diff to operate on JSON nicely, rather than changing the entire notebook format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i wanted to like marimo, but the best notebook interface i've tried so far is vscode's interactive window [0]. the important thing is that it's a python file first, but you can divide up the code into cells to run in the jupyter kernel either all at once or interactively.0: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When working with Jupyter, too often you end up with directories strewn with spaghetti-code notebooks, counting up to Untitled12.ipynb or higher. You the notebook author don’t know what’s in these notebooksThis is such a small UX thing but it’s so damn important. The simple fix is to not auto-name notebooks untitled-# when the user clicks new notebook just ask the name straight away, if they can’t name it don’t create it. It might add the smallest amount of friction to the UX, but it’s so damn important.Also the choice of json as the file format is just plain wrong. Why the project hasn’t just abandoned that entirely and done a json-#python back and forth when writing to file is beyond me. There are extensions that do this, but that’s a really clunky interface, and while I can set it up for myself it’s difficult to force upon others in a corporate environment.Great to see someone is taking the seemingly small things up, because they mean a world of difference to the overall ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43415477</guid></item><item><title>47.

Since it’s building all dynamic libraries in your system from scratch, it can generate symbol databases for each of them. At the end, you can have your build tar them all up as an artifact.It’s pretty magical seeing a crash report that provides backtraces symbolicated all the way up to libc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part 2 - https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/06/fuzzing-rust-minidump-for-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was an engaging read and really well written considering the dryness of the subject matter.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of generic types in C programming, focusing on strategies to create generic data structures and functions. It explains the benefits of generics, such as code reusability and type safety, and offers practical examples, including the use of macros and void pointers to achieve type independence. The author also addresses potential pitfalls and best practices to ensure that generic implementations remain robust and maintainable. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for C programmers seeking to enhance their coding skills by leveraging generics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The former is nicer to program while the latter is nicer to use.When I have such a situation, I'm inclined to write myself my own pre-processor (as I did for Pascal once in a previous millenium, on an Atari ST 520+), so that you can write in a style that is nicer to program in, which gets pre-compiled into something that is nicer to use from your client code.Nothing comes without downsides: the price of this is that other developers need to understand your idiosyncratic pre-processor, so this method works best for "single author" code/personal projects.What you don't want in a team is each coder having their own way of doing things, so that you cannot share libraries and helper functions.BTW, the best book on the OP's topic of production coding in C and implementing type-safe ADTs is Chris Hanson's book "C: Interfaces and Implementations." It contains some eye-opening tricks even for experienced developers in (standard) C.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For C with generic types, I think one should pick up Zig. It's exactly that, it's a low level language with manual memory management, but it allows you to do generic types like this without hacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably worth mentioning the C Template Library [1]...[1]: https://github.com/glouw/ctl/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43377966</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Tesla is losing its competitive edge in the global electric vehicle (EV) market, particularly as Chinese manufacturers gain prominence. Factors contributing to this shift include increased production capabilities and innovation from Chinese companies, which are offering high-quality EVs at lower prices.

Way more than Tesla.Maybe making a dumb triangular truck that nobody wanted wasn't such a good idea after all. I imagine the BYD cars have such mod cons as rain sensors that work and indicator stalks too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope that Tesla will change its top management asap.Imagine a situation where you have a new 800V infrastructure already applied to cybertruck and decide to update the Model Y with just “minor” adjustments. Which means that both M3 and MY will get 800V/48V when? 2/3 years minimum.It recalls me a Nokia moment.Meanwhile China is running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China has everything needed for cheap and efficient manufacturing.  The design skills, the infrastructure, the cheap labour, the network of factories, etc.The US does not.The only reason the US might win at car manufacturing will be if there are sufficient tariffs or other trade barriers.    In a free market, China will win.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43410579</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and frustrations developers face when using GitHub Actions, a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool. It highlights issues such as the complexity of configuration, the potential for debugging difficulties, and the limitations of performance and flexibility. The author shares personal experiences and suggests that while GitHub Actions provides powerful automation capabilities, its intricacies can often lead to pain points that hinder developers' productivity. Overall, the piece underscores the need for improved usability and clearer documentation to enhance user experience with the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Already see people saying GitLab is better: yes it is, but it also sucks in different ways.After years of dealing with this (first Jenkins, then GitLab, then GitHub), my takeaway is:* Write as much CI logic as possible in your own code. Does not really matter what you use (shell scripts, make, just, doit, mage, whatever) as long as it is proper, maintainable code.* Invest time that your pipelines can run locally on a developer machine as well (as much as possible at least), otherwise testing/debugging pipelines becomes a nightmare.* Avoid YAML as much as possible, period.* Don't bind yourself to some fancy new VC-financed thing that will solve CI once and for all but needs to get monetized eventually (see: earthly, dagger, etc.)* Always use your own runners, on-premise if possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the joy of HN, for me, at least. I'm genuinely fascinated to read that both GitHub Actions and DevOps are (apparently) so universally hated. I've been using both for many years, with barely a hiccup, and I actually really enjoy and value what they do. It would never have dawned on me, outside this thread, to think that so many people dislike it. Nice to see a different perspective!Are the Actions a little cumbersome to set up and test? Sure. Is it a little annoying to have to make somewhat-useless commits just to re-trigger an Action to see if it works? Absolutely. But once it works, I just set it and forget it. I've barely touched my workflows in ~4 years, outside of the Node version updates.Otherwise, I'm very pleased with both. My needs must just be simple enough to not run into these more complicated issues, I guess?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a fascinating read as someone who is currently working on migrating CI platforms. We deal with hundreds of internal repos where many CI platforms just don't scale well. We are probably going to choose Github Actions because it looks like the simplest, least-BS option. The problems the author mentions would be the least of our concerns.Totally agree with other comments saying to keep as much logic out of CI config as possible. Many CI features are too convoluted for their own good. Keep it really simple. You can use any CI platform and have a shit time if you don't take the right approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43419701</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic's article discusses the introduction of its new web search feature that enables users to access real-time information and answer queries directly through their AI assistant. This capability enhances the assistant's functionality by providing up-to-date data and expanded knowledge beyond its training cutoff, allowing it to assist with current events and live information searches. The feature aims to combine the strengths of AI with web search to offer users a more comprehensive tool for information retrieval and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Searching the web is a great feature in theory, but every implementation I've used so far looks at the top X hits and then interprets it to be the correct answer.When you're talking to an LLM about popular topics or common errors, the top results are often just blogspam or unresolved forum posts, so the you never get an answer to your problem.More of an indicator that web search is more unusable than ever, but interesting that it affects the performance of generative systems, nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massive props to Anthropic for announcing a feature _and_ making it available for everyone right away.OpenAI is so annoying in this aspect. They will regularly give timelines for rollout that not met or simply wrong.Edit: "Everyone" = Everyone who pays. Sorry if this sounds mean but I don't care about what the free tier gets or when. As a paying user for both Anthropic and OpenAI I was just pointing out the rollout differences.Edit2: My US-bias is showing, sorry I didn't even parse that in the message.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It badly hallucinated in my test. I asked it "Rust crate to access Postgres with Arrow support" and it made up an arrow-postgres crate. It even gave sample Rust code using this fictional crate! Below is its response (code example omitted):I can recommend a Rust crate for accessing PostgreSQL with Arrow support.
The primary crate you'll want to use is arrow-postgres, which combines the PostgreSQL connectivity of the popular postgres crate with Apache Arrow data format support.
This crate allows you to:Query PostgreSQL databases using SQL
Return results as Arrow record batches
Use strongly-typed Arrow schemas
Convert between PostgreSQL and Arrow data types efficiently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43425655</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the use case for putting AI into everything? Pretty much every AI product so far has been and still is subject to hallucinations and inaccuracies and on top of that it's hugely computing intensive. Sure, it's the best we have right now and it allows us to do things that were previously next to impossible with manual programming work, but it's far from being something that's actually viable. And what would be the use case for turning a picture into an approximated 3d mesh that is only really complete from one angle? LIDAR does a stunningly accurate job at that already, reproducibly (although granted that this cannot retroactively be applied to existing photos).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't seem to work that well.  Once you move off the primary camera axis, like rotate around, you notice that there are many regions with only sparse resolution and there are gaps everywhere.  It is totally unusable for anything.Sure, it solves for the primary view, but this is claiming it is a 3D scene reconstruction/inference technique and in that claim it only sort of works.For example: https://i.postimg.cc/43tj36jv/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-8-52-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m imagining this approach being combined down the line with your typical photogrammetry approach for reinforcing quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43417932</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would create new pseudo elements:    .container:gap { background-color: red; }

This will allow for more fancy backgrounds (e.g. dotted or gradients) and using { padding: 2px } to set whitespace at ends of the seperator.Possible with a :gap-horz and :gap-vert (or whatever css like to name it) to get seperate vertical and horizontal gaps.Also: .container:gap:nth-gap(2n) { color: blue; } to get alternating colors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design by committee is not the best but if you need one more view to be convinced, as a non native English speakers the property names proposed are not communicating the meaning very well. Eg Defining the gap but drawing the separator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish they took the use-case of resizable panels into account. Even if the implementation is fully user-land, a styleable separator that can also receive events would be so useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43420683</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Frontend Treadmill" discusses the rapid pace of change in frontend development technologies and frameworks, highlighting the constant need for developers to learn new tools and strategies to stay current. It emphasizes the stress and pressure this creates, likening it to a treadmill where developers run continuously without reaching a finish line. The author suggests that while adapting to new technologies is important, developers should also focus on mastering foundational skills and understanding core principles to avoid burnout and maintain a sustainable career in frontend development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have recently been doing some upgrades to the build system for our FE code to swap out yarn for pnpm. I’m normally a backend engineer, but I’ve spent plenty of time in the JS mines.The most frustrating thing about dipping in to the FE is that it seems like literally everything is deprecated. Oh, you used the apollo CLI in 2022? Bam, deprecated, go learn how to use graphql-client or whatever, which has a totally different configuration and doesn’t support all the same options. Okay, so we just keep the old one and disable the node engine check in pnpm that makes it complain. Want to do a patch upgrade to some dependency? Hope you weren’t relying on any of its type signatures! Pin that as well, with a todo in the codebase hoping someone will update the signatures.Finally get things running, watch the stream of hundreds of deprecation warnings fly by during the install. Eventually it builds, and I get the hell out of there.It’s just nuts to me the degree to which FE development as a whole seems to embrace the breaking change, the deprecation, etc. I’ve been working on a large rust project for nearly four years and in that time there have been a few minor breaking changes in or of third party libraries, but only one major breaking change that required significant changes to our application. Meanwhile in JS it seems like you can’t go more than six months without having to rewrite something. It’s bananas.Okay, rant over.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; And if you’re an engineer, you will be able to retain much higher market value over time if you dig into and understand core web technologiesBeen working in FE for nearly 20 years and lived through several major paradigm shifts. I think I am qualified to have an opinion here:I definitely think that you will be a more well-rounded engineer if you know all the core web tech. So strongly agree there. I am skeptical, however, that it will make you more attractive on the job market. It's not that knowing this stuff doesn't matter, it's that folks that make hiring decisions tend to pattern match. The fact is that if you want to maximize your "market value", you still need to be _very_ good at React. This is table stakes. Everything else is great, but if you don't have that foundation, you're limiting your options.Maybe that is what the author meant and I am just misreading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Whatever framework you choose will be obsolete in 5 years.I am predominantly not a frontend dev, but when I do do frontend work, (and I don't avoid it by any means,) I have been using React for the past... 10 years now? And while some sentiment has been moving towards Svelte, by the time Svelte overtakes React, it will have been in production for just as long probably. And Angular might eventually run out of steam, but it's been around even longer than React, if you want to count the Angular1 and Angular2+ days together. So honestly I think this is out-of-date logic. While frontend dev moves fast, it really isn't that bad. Pick boring choices and you get boring results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422162</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the capabilities and limitations of AI in generating diagrams. It discusses various types of diagrams, such as flowcharts, mind maps, and network diagrams, highlighting how AI can automate the creation of these visual tools efficiently. However, the author emphasizes that while AI excels in generating standard and repetitive diagrams, it struggles with more complex and context-specific designs that require human creativity and nuanced understanding. The piece ultimately outlines the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and recognizing its current boundaries in generating sophisticated, customized diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mistake I see people repeating over and over, is never restarting their conversations with a edited initial message.Instead of doing what the author is doing here, and sending messages back and forward, leading to a longer and longer conversation, where each messages leads to worse and worse quality replies, until the LLM seems like a dumb rock, rewrite your initial message with everything that went wrong/was misunderstood, and aim to have whatever you want solved in the first message, and you'll get a lot higher quality answers. If the LLM misunderstood, don't reply "No, what I mean was..." but instead rewrite the first message so it's clearer.This is at least true for all ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek models, YMMV with other models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use mermaidjs as a supercharged version of chain-of-thought for generating some sophisticated decompositions of the intent.Then we injected the generated mermaid diagrams back into subsequent requests. Reasoning performance improves for a whole variety of applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random thoughts:Sketching backed by automated cleanup can be good for entering small diagrams. There used to be an iOS app based on graphviz: http://instaviz.comConstraint-based interactive layout may be underinvested, as a consequence of too many disappointments and false starts in the 1980s.LLMs seem ill-suited to solving the optimization of combinatorial and geometric constraints and objectives required for good diagram layout. Overall, one has to admire the directness and simplicity of mermaid. Also, it would be great to someday see a practical tool with the quality and generality of the ultra-compact grid layout prototype from the Monash group, https://ialab.it.monash.edu/~dwyer/papers/gridlayout2015.pdf  (2015!!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43398434</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently got into creating avatars for VR and have used AI to learn Unity/Blender so ridiculously fast, like just a couple weeks I've been at it now. All the major models can answer basically any question. I can paste in screenshots of what I'm working on and questions and it will tell me step by step what to do. I'll ask it what particular settings mean, there are so many settings in 3d programs; it'll explain them all and suggest defaults. You can literally give Gemini UV maps and it'll generate textures for you, or this for 3d models. It feels like the jump before/after stack overflow.The game Myst is all about this magical writing script that allowed people to write entire worlds in books. That's where it feels like this is all going. Unity/Blender/Photoshop/etc.. is ripe for putting a LLM over the entire UI and exposing the APIs to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried it on my Radeon 7900 GRE 16GB on Windows 11 WSL Ubuntu 24.04 with torch 2.4.0 and rocm 6.3.4, from here, https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-6.3.4/.I am impressed, it runs very fast. Far faster than the non-turbo version. But the primary time is being spent on the texture generation and not on the model generation. As far as I can understand this speeds up the model generation and not the texture generation. But impressive nonetheless.I also took a head shot of my kid and ran it through https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/ai/image/remove-backgr... and cropped the image and resized it to 1024x1024 and it spit out a 3d model with texture of my kid. There are still some small artifacts, but I am impressed. It works very well with the assets/example_images. Very usable.Good work Hunyuan!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice model, but strange license. You are not allowed to use it in EU, UK, and South Korea.“Territory” shall mean the worldwide territory, excluding the territory of the European Union, United Kingdom and South Korea.You agree not to use Tencent Hunyuan 3D 2.0 or Model Derivatives:

Is it partly a Japanese sovereign fund...I've become less and less interested in its investments as it seems to simply act like a giant government money channel with questionable investments that don't seem to make sense from a typical VC/PE perspective. Ie is its ultimate goal not merely profit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So Softbank now competes with Arm's customers and (unless I've missed something on new governance arrangements) also gets access to confidential information on Arm's customers' businesses (plans, volumes etc). Hmmm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ampere is still the only people making a decent purchaseable ARM server.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: 2^133477987019 is the smallest power of two that ends with 40 even digits. In fact, it ends with 46 even digits - which is surprising, given that it is significantly smaller than 2^(2^46). The last 50 digits of this number are ...32070644226208822284248862288402404246620406284288. This number has over 40 billion digits, though, so it seems kind of unlikely that we will ever find another number where all the digits are even. The relevant OEIS sequence is here: https://oeis.org/A096549Context: I wrote a search program that is substantially faster - it takes just a few minutes to get up to 2^(10^13), although my laptop's limited memory is starting to be a problem (my intermediate result file is already nearly 1GB in size). Unfortunately, it seems there are no results up to 2^15258789062500, which is a 4.5-trillion digit number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on this once after an argument with my boyfriend.The original argument was "the ones digit has permanent pattern in 2^n {2,4,8,6,2...}.We made a system to generate digits for powers of two, although eventually we just made one that can take arbitrary bases, and found that you can decompose digit frequency and find a variety of NMR like resonances that vary based on where you terminate data collection.It was really fun and this makes me want to get back into this so I could check the properties of those resonances across bases and stopping points for data collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Definitely not finite in radix-16 (hexadecimal):

Is this right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, I'm Jeff and I was PM for these models at OpenAI. Today we launched three new state-of-the-art audio models. Two speech-to-text models—outperforming Whisper.

We recently finished a large scale installation just outside of Las Vegas (by some measures the largest in the US). It was backed by a PE firm. Costs are getting so low, the tech so predictable, and with battery warranties around 20 years the PE firm is able to get pretty high return with a fairly low risk. They enter into a "power purchase agreement" with the utility so they know how much they will be able to sell the power for, and as long as we collect data on the batteries they will be able to be warrantied if there is an issue (but there rarely are issues).The batteries are by far the most expensive portion of the setup. The solar by comparison is dirt cheap. We have single axis tracking like mentioned in the article. Every day we fully charge the batteries, and discharge them in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I haven't seen much coverage on is how to tap into the giant batteries we're driving around in our electric vehicles.  These are much bigger than what's currently being deployed in houses.The V2H standards are just now coming online: https://electrek.co/2025/02/21/nema-bidirectional-ev-chargin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422033</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) announcement of the first direct measurement of the temperature of a planet outside our solar system, known as exoplanet WASP-189b. Utilizing the Ultra High-Definition (UHD) camera on the VLT’s (Very Large Telescope) SPHERE instrument, astronomers were able to determine the presence of an atmosphere and its temperature, which exceeds 3,200 degrees Celsius. The findings provide vital insights into the extreme conditions of such exoplanets and enhance our understanding of their atmospheres, which can help in the study of planetary formation and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

Are there assumptions or parameters in our model for the age of the universe that could be inaccurate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It fits the theme that,  according to Webb,  the universe developed a lot more quickly in what we think were the first billion years...  Most likely the "first billion years" were more like five billion years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422909</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides resources and guidance for workers interested in unionizing. It offers a step-by-step process on how to form a union, addressing common questions and concerns. The site emphasizes the benefits of unionization, such as improved working conditions and employee rights, while also providing practical tools and tips for organizing efforts, including legal considerations and strategies for building worker solidarity. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive guide for individuals looking to empower themselves through collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software engineering is one of the ways of playing life in "easy mode" (I moved from academia over a decade ago, and I know the difference). This blog post tries to paint it differently - and it feels like it lacks perspective compared to virtually any other occupation.&gt; We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code, demanding 80 hour weeks under the guise of "passion."Yet, it is up to us. In some software jobs (AAA game dev and a certain type of startup), you are expected to crunch beyond limits. In other places, you can have a typical 40h/week job at a salary way better than the average 9-5 job. Or you can freelance a dozen hours a week and live in a remote cottage. Or work from Thailand when it's winter. Or take a gap year to regenerate, or reinvent, yourself.Not many career choices support this freedom. In some (e.g., medical careers), grind is not optional—you won't finish university, you won't get established, and that's the end of the story. In many other jobs, if you were freelancing a dozen hours a week, you would literally not be able to afford food. In many professions, quitting means the end of a career - or at least a serious setback; in tech, it means getting many messages on LinkedIn.Don't get me wrong - I am all for criticism of grind and exploitation. But let's not paint ourselves, members of one of the most privileged occupations, as victims of the global system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think unions need to work on their marketing. I resonate with all of these problems, but the "fixes" sound like a politician saying, "elect me and I'll solve your problems."What's the A+ example out there of a unionized engineering team that has been able to find a great work-life balance, great benefits, and a fun product development life-cycle that is profitable or clearly on its way to profitability? Show me this company.I have family and friends who work for airline unions, parcel unions, teacher unions, etc. Some love it, some hate it. Those who love it had a broken fan in the van all summer with no air conditioning until the union stepped in. How would a union meaningfully improve that situation at a tech office with paid lunches and decent benefits?Like, the promise of a better tomorrow from unions carries the same tone as a promise to IPO "really soon" from the CEO/CFO tag team at the annual kick-off meeting. What does it look like when rubber meets the road?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome to see something like this on HN. As we keep working for less pay, more hours, the constant threat of layoffs, and business leaders frothing at the mouth to replace us all with AI, it's important to remember that we aren't powerless as workers. It's also important to remember that your relationship to the higher-ups is adversarial. They want to get as much productivity out of you for as little pay as possible. It's not because they're evil, it's just good business. Organizing helps protect us as things get worse.I see a lot of my colleagues resigned to the reality we live in and just hoping they get lucky enough to come out on the right side of the meat grinder by making a few bucks at a startup. I've worked in a couple industries, and tech workers seem to lack solidarity in a way I haven't seen elsewhere. I survived three rounds of layoffs at a startup, and every time the attitude among some of my colleagues was that we "trimmed the fat." I somewhat agreed and got caught up in that culture until I got picked up in the fourth round of layoffs at a time when I felt I was doing my best work. We need each other as workers to get through a future that looks gloomy for technology developers. As the saying goes: "united we bargain, divided we beg." A better world is possible!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43427002</guid></item><item><title>15.

That must be a pain in the ass to type in. Is that because the tech is 50 years old from before QWERTY was the standard? Do newer planes have QWERTY?0: https://acarsdrama.com/fmc.webpUnrelated, this one is cute: https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama/114194436695883209&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. I love these feeds.A very common flow for me when I see something weird on adsb or fr24 is to grab the ICAO address of the plane and search it on https://app.airframes.io/ to see if it was sending out any ACARS messages so I can... see what the drama was ha!It's a really fun hobby if you find this stuff interesting. You can pick up an SDR online for like $30 USD and be able to do all this without Internet, above your own home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43424065</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a subject that will likely hinge on politics and commodity markets, but the science is very clear as is occam's razor1. There is a lot of animal life in the deep ocean where these modules are present and absent where they are not2. Those organisms depend on oxygen to function3. Polymetallic nodules taken from the deep ocean have been shown in lab conditions to create enough of an electric charge to split H2O into H2 and O24. Areas where polymetallic nodules have been removed decades ago haven't recovered even on a microorganism level5. These nodules individually take *millions* of years to formFrom these conclusions we can safely assume that removing them would decimate these ecosystems on a timescale that's longer than evolution of the genus Homo. Put another way it would be as if we cut down a forest knowing it would take millions of years for individual trees to regrow. It is a crime against the planet to remove these nodules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I can't vouch for this study's accuracy, deep-sea mining companies will find a way to discredit any research that opposes their interests. Marine ecosystems are already under significant stress, and these mining operations will certainly accelerate the damage that's already happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This cast doubt on the long-established view that life was made possible when organisms started producing oxygen via photosynthesis, which requires sunlight, about 2.7 billion years ago.So ... life began because it started producing oxygen via photosynthesis? I think they oopsed the word "multicellular" or "complex". A low-grade article and a long shot of a theory, but maybe not impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43386973</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the current threats to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) infrastructure posed by AI companies. It highlights concerns regarding the increasing reliance on proprietary AI technologies, which may undermine the principles of openness and collaboration inherent in FOSS. The author argues that as AI continues to advance, it is crucial for the FOSS community to defend its values, protect its projects, and ensure that software remains accessible and free to users. Emphasizing the importance of community-driven efforts, the article calls for vigilance and action to safeguard the future of FOSS in the face of corporate encroachment.&lt;/p&gt;

(quoted in the OP) -- everyone I know has a similar story who is running large internet infrastructure -- this post does a great job of rounding a bunch of them up in 1 place.I called it when I wrote it, they are just burning their goodwill to the ground.I will note that one of the main startups in the space worked with us directly, refunded our costs, and fixed the bug in their crawler. Facebook never replied to our emails, the link in their User Agent led to a 404 -- an engineer at the company saw our post and reached out, giving me the right email -- which I then emailed 3x and never got a reply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a callout that Fastly provides free bot detection, CDN, and other security services for FOSS projects, and has been for 10+ years https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward (disclaimer, I work for Fastly and help with this program)Without going into too much detail, this tracks with the trends in inquiries we're getting from new programs and existing members. A few years ago, the requests were almost exclusively related to performance, uptime, implementing OWASP rules in a WAF, or more generic volumetric impact. Now, AI scraping is increasingly something that FOSS orgs come to us for help with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's really surreal to see my project in the preview image like this. That's wild! If you want to try it: https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis. So far I've noticed that it seems to actually work.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces Grease, a new programming language developed by Galois designed for safety-critical systems. It emphasizes the language's features, such as its focus on formal verification and combining high-level safety with low-level control. Grease aims to simplify the process of writing safe and secure software by enabling developers to reason about their code more effectively. The language is positioned to address common challenges in systems programming while ensuring high levels of reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm suspicious of the effectiveness. Most people are doing symbolic execution to find bad pointer dereferences as bugs, whereas this tool is doing it to build the least constrained model and then checking the code against that same model. Wouldn't any code paths that are discovered as part of symbolic exploration and have out-of-bounds read/writes then be infered away as constraints, instead of bugs? Or being unable to detect memory corruption in the form of controlled pointer value overwrites, since you can't say that all pointer dereferences derived from your symbolic input are bugs that allow for attacked controlled memory corruption, because you don't have a concept of what inputs are under user control unlike most uses of Angr or other symbolic tainting tools. Is there a better list of the types of bug classes or heuristics that this is able to catch? Are there any numbers on the false positive/false negative rates against a dataset?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d built an AI agent to accomplish this using Ghidra + GDB for dynamic analysis (tested it on crackmes)It worked surprisingly wellApplied to YC with it, sadly no interviewWas later told by some accepted friends/VCs that our application was good, but without pedigree we needed traction to de-risk / get accepted :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would this have uncovered the XZ Utils scandal quicker?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43423523</guid></item><item><title>20.

Agriculture is often not very efficient because of old water rules that give water to things like hobby farms when real farms downstream don't get what they need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is never mentioned that electricity from fossil fuel generation consumes a lot of water.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, electric power generators are the largest source of U.S. water withdrawals and account for about 40% of total water withdrawals in the United States:https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37453Thermoelectric power plants—including coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants—boil water to create steam, which then spins a turbine to generate electricity. Cooling water is passed through the steam leaving the turbine to cool and condense the steam. This step reduces the steam's exit pressure and recaptures its heat, which is then used to preheat fluid entering the boiler.U.S. thermoelectric plants are the largest source of U.S. water withdrawals, accounting for more than 40% of total U.S. water withdrawals in 2015:https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50698&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in Mexico. About 30 mins from where I live, Amazon and others have built data centers (presumably for AI) which consume water.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels nuts to me that there is a push away from strict APIs to conversational interfaces for products and then the actual technology itself under the hood is translating that into a strict set of API calls in order to understand something.  Would it not be better to seek interoperability with fairly well scripted natural language handshake.  I feel like MCP is built for understanding language and Syntax to a greater degree but not random tools and APIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yea Claude sucks at minesweeper (and many spatial reasoning tasks), but isn’t an idea of MCPs is that Claude should be able to ask an MCP what the next best move is rather than figuring it out itself? Like offload hard thinking/reasoning to purpose-built solvers because they are deterministic? Though I guess you’d expect a reasoning model to be able to come up with its own solvers on the fly, especially for well-known problems. Maybe having access to an MCP itself is confusing it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe tell it it's a champion Minesweeper player and that loss is not an option :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43420678</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The explicit regions make it really clear what "borrowing" is actually doing. Rust tries to do as much as possible implicitly, which is convenient 90% of the time but when it doesn't work as you expect you're left scratching your head.If nothing else, Austral makes for a wonderful teaching language for linear types/regions/capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really love the principles set out here. Love the concessions made in order to keep the language simpler.I've been idly considering building an alternative Rust std lib with a shape that reminds me of the capabilities system laid out here. In my case that was less out of a desire for supply chain security (impossible if I'm just swapping the std lib) and more to discourage side effects from being produced deep within the core of program logic.WRT the rejection of async, has there been any consideration of a more general feature like generators or coroutines? Resumable functions are a really nice way to write state machines. I don't expect those to go out of style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linear types are an interesting idea.I really liked the way that each transformation of the file was a separate File object, reminded me of functional style immutable data structures where each transformation returns a new structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43419928</guid></item><item><title>23.

In the demo, they used the Brian voice. For the first example, I can get this in ElevenLabs [1]. Stability was set to 20 here and all the other settings were at their default. Having stability at the default of 50 sounds more like what is in the demo on the site [2].Having said that, I'm fully in favor of open source and am a big proponent of open source models like this. ElevenLabs in particular has the highest quality (I tested a lot of models for a tool I'm building [3]), but the pricing is also 400 times more expensive than the rest. You easily pay multiple dollars per minute of text-to-speech generation. For people interested, the best audio quality I could get so far is [4]. Someone told me he wouldn't be able to tell that the voice was not real.[1]: https://elevenlabs.io/app/share/3NyQKlL6EeOHpIDtL5pA[2]: https://elevenlabs.io/app/share/TUx4yluXtV3pFTHr7Cl7[3]: https://github.com/transformrs/trv[4]: https://youtu.be/Ni-dKlCpnb4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GGUF version created by "isaiahbjork" which is compatible with LM Studio and llama.cpp server at: https://github.com/isaiahbjork/orpheus-tts-local/To run llama.cpp server:

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of a deep learning course offered by Carnegie Mellon University, designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and techniques in deep learning. It includes information about the course syllabus, schedule, assignments, and resources for both students and instructors. The course aims to equip participants with practical skills and theoretical understanding necessary for applying deep learning in various domains, alongside a focus on hands-on programming and project work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember taking this course at CMU, I had no knowledge of deep learning before this course. After this course, I had trained over 75 models in the assignments, implemented a pytorch backend and a significantly large course project that I was confident to launch my career in Deep Learning. Cannot recommend this course enough, you need to do all the assignments to get maximum value out of it and it can be intense. But think of it as a bootcamp for machine learning. I still find these course materials useful in interviews.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;You will need familiarity with basic calculus (differentiation, chain rule), linear algebra, and basic probability.So if I'm at the point that math skills, rather than programming skills are my barrier to interesting courses like this one, does anyone know of any good resources? I don't seem able to teach myself calc from a book like I did Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took this course the first semester it was given. There was one TA, and now there's 24! Fun fact: The TA was the writer of Aqua's 90s hit "Doctor Jones".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43418218</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well written article. It reminds me of the zero day that Apple tried to cover up somewhat - the "empty password tried twice" root login bypass. This was ca. 2017 or so, maybe 2018.You were able to type in an administrator username in any root sign in box (e.g. in the settings panel via the padlock icon) with an empty password. Hitting the Sign In button the first time told you that the password was incorrect. Dismissing that alert box and hitting sign in a second time signed you in as that user.We were able to reproduce it 100% of the time day-of, and of course was patched pretty shortly after making the rounds on social media. Still seems like a massive oversight though.Seems there's still some cruft around the auth mechanisms in Mac. Interesting to see the port system mentioned - it's not a well known fact of Mach kernels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"ACLs don't": https://waterken.sourceforge.net/aclsdont/current.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A minor correction was made to the article:Entitlement checks are not in the Mach layer of the kernel.https://github.com/nmggithub/wts/commit/2bdce1c0c76c7adc360e...Just a one word change, fixing a factual inaccuracy when talking about how XNU works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43425605</guid></item><item><title>27.

A shining, straightforward FOSS success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;phpMyAdmin was (is?) such a great tool and really got me into SQL/MySQL over a decade ago. Not to mention the whole PHP stack was so fun to use and let you iterate quickly and just build stuff with an immediate feedback loop - just reload the page and your updated server-side code is executed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the same vein, I have a single-file library which allows you to use flat files as key-value DBs.

It scheduled this action to happen after 30 days. Even though there were indicators that this unsafe action was going to occur, no software engineers–humans–were actually monitoring the indicators. So, after 30 days, the unsafe control action occurred, resulting in an outage.Isn't this the time they accidentally deleted governmental databases?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a similar need, and after going through the docs for a few existing solutions (grafana, elastic, prometheus, etc) I decided to roll my own.No db on the receiver and log-based storage on the senders (using standard log rotation to manage size). A systemd service to write to logs, another to read the last value and push to remote if it has changed. Bash all around.Other than absolutely 0 maintenance required, and just a $5 droplet, the thing I like the most is the dashboard. It just looks like a spreadsheet. A row for each server, a column for each metric. Click on a cell to view charts for that metric. If metrics are failing health checks cell goes orange, or red if critical. Otherwise it's all gray.So I can have the dashboard open on a screen and just glance at it and know if something is off. I haven't seen anyone else providing such a dashboard, maybe you can give it a go:)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat project! I’ve seen a few analytics tools starting to use SQLite over  Clickhouse. It’s great for small to medium sized projects, and can potentially scale (but I haven’t tested it over 200k hits per month).I rolled out a similar project a few months ago using Django + SQLite.https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearlytics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read your documentation and this is one of the best projects I came across. No unnecessary complexities, gets the job done with simple REST calls.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the ancient Minoan civilization of Crete, which flourished during the Aegean Bronze Age. It discusses the archaeological discoveries that have reshaped our understanding of Minoan society, culture, and religion, emphasizing the importance of sites like Knossos. The piece highlights the unique aspects of Minoan life, such as their advanced architecture, art, and trade practices, while also addressing the challenges historians face in interpreting their symbols and rituals. Ultimately, it underscores the significance of ongoing research and restoration efforts to revive interest in and appreciation for this enigmatic civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason it was very hard for the Victorians who pioneered archaeology to understand that ancient humans were actual human beings and not storytelling archetypes or moral exemplars. This kind of archaeology is just inverted science fiction: Commenting on the present through the lens of the imaginary past, instead of the imaginary future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For throwing that much shade, it does a piss poor job in actually backing up or citing the evidence.Evans definitely had issues with how he went about things and his analysis. For example, the "snake goddess" is holding snakes remarkably similar to wooden snake props found in Egypt 300 years earlier.But this article is pretty damn empty of actual substance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I visited Knossos on three occasions and every time I returned I found it even more enchanting and evocative.  Not only does it speak of a fascinating  flourishing Bronze Age civilization which could be said to be, via the Greco-Roman, the grandmother of Western civilization, but also because it speaks just as loudly of another time of flourishing arts, this time much more recent, of all those artists mentioned in the article, and more besides.Evans clearly wasn't perfect, nor his restoration (confabulation? reinvention?) work, but I think they are also better than what the critics claim.  For better or worse, he really did give new life to those old stones.  Sure, he might well have exaggerated Minoan pacifism (and proto-feminism) to make a point, but didn't completely make it up either.Talking about Minoan art, here's [1] an article about a jaw-droppingly exquisite seal stone only recently discovered. Also related to the article in that it depicts a bloody war scene.  It was found in a Mycenaean tomb, they were known to be much more war-like, so maybe a commission.  What's most remarkable though it the anatomical precision which took a thousand years to be rediscovered/reinvented again, this time in Classical Greece. The same type of work stunningly modern-looking musculature depiction can be seen in a couple of fragments at the highly recommended Heraklion Archeological Museum in the capital of Crete. Worth checking out in the same museum, mind-bendingly playful yet refined pottery, called Kamares Ware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43385127</guid></item><item><title>35.

Seriously, I asked it for biblical advice about a tough situation today and it said it was praying for me. XD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm wondering how small of a model can be "generally intelligent" (as in LLM intelligent, not AGI).  Like there must be a size too small to hold "all the information" in.And I also wonder at what point we'll see specialized small models.  Like if I want help coding, it's probably ok if the model doesn't know who directed "Jaws".  I suspect that is the future: many small, specialized models.But maybe training compute will just get to the point where we can run a full-featured model on our desktop (or phone)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe Llama 3.3 70B doesn't count as running on "one GPU", but it certainly runs just fine on one Mac, and in my tests it's far better at holding onto concepts over a longer conversation than Gemma 3 is, which starts getting confused after about 4000 tokens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43427115</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beautiful writing.I know the nostalgia of your first tough job. Mine was certainly not as blue as the oil fields of Alberta, nor the railways, it really wasn’t even blue collar. But I did find it tough. I was a food runner in a kitchen built to serve 90 that served 450 + catered events.The chaos and heat was overwhelming. My most active day was doing 30,000 steps during a 5 hour lunch shift, half of which were walked with a 40+ pound tray being carried just over my shoulder (on the shoulder was not classy enough). The kitchen was easily 110 degrees and had a single comically small fan that did absolute fuck all. The steam from the washing machine blasted you every time you went to grab bread, the chef was a maniac who makes “the bear” look really chill in comparison. And even without him every person in that kitchen was ready to explode at any time.Fortunately I make quite a bit more now than I did then. I’ve made it to the other side of the dining car window, so to speak. But I really do miss it. Especially the chaos. If you spent 30 seconds in that kitchen, you’d be confused as to how a single dish ever made it out the door. And yet we consistently served 2k+ people on our busiest days.It was the best job I’ve ever had and likely will ever have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the Union Pacific's management recruiting video.[1]
They're up front about it being a tough job in miserable conditions.
The video opens in a railroad yard in Chicago in a snowstorm at 5 AM.The CEO started in track maintenance and worked up to driving a train.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMViWazEYoc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"As it happened, one of my father’s sisters, Aunt Irene, was a vice president of the Canadian National Railways" kinda says it all.Put on "Common people" by Pulp in the background when you read this article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43379173</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential of using particle accelerators to create even smaller and more efficient chips for electronic devices. It highlights the challenges of current chip manufacturing processes and how particle accelerators, commonly used in physics research, could enable the production of transistors at a nanometer scale. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance computing power and efficiency, but it also raises questions about compatibility with existing technologies and the economic implications of implementing such advanced manufacturing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;EUV has always been about achieving high enough power to be economically viable. It was never about making chips at any cost.I remember reading the tinfoil hat theory about three-letter agencies making low-quantity high-cost chips at incredible process sizes in order to break encryption. I doubt that's still as viable today as it was before leakage currents started dominating, but it was an impressively plausible theory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free Electron Lasers have potential to generate more tunable radiation with higher luminosity. Despite this they aren't a drop in replacement for the current EUV light sources. A free electron laser is 200 meters long, so a single laser would feed multiple EUV machines for it to be economical. This technology is very promising but it has been under development for a while.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello,author of Stelvio here. Stelvio is in very early alpha far from any production use, but it's able to deploy simple API gateway, lambda and dynamo db tables with just few lines of code.Idea is that Python devs should be able to deal with infra with Python only and minimal boilerplate - simple thing should be simple.I'm currently working on v 0.2.0 which will have support for lambda dependencies &amp; layers, Dynamo indexes and CORS and authorizers for API gateway.I hope to release that in April.For v0.3.0, stelvio will get it's own CLI too.Any feedback is welcomed here or michal at stelvio.devMichal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not trying to detract from the OP, but to provide a combination I have running in production for 2 years.- aws cdk (with outputs)
- https://github.com/zappa/Zappa
- a python script which stitches outputs from cdk into the zappa config
- extra python scripts to do a few small things post deployment. Zappa has some bugs that would be tedious to fix vs 100 lines of python.Our product has the luxury of only being used during stock market hours and really thrives in serverless everything. We use rds serverless (v2) along with lambdas.Some of our work is heavy and we’ll dynamically spin up an ecs container which has the hallmarks of a normal django app: redis + celery queues. We try to saturate the ecs container resources with this type of setup. After the container is done, it’ll shutdown.I was super skeptical of this 2 years ago. 4 envs costing ~$2k/month. I would do this setup again if the product warrants windowed usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently made a serverless lambda/dynamo webapp following similar patterns and wrote about the experience here: https://johnscolaro.xyz/blog/serverless-python-websitesI think it's amazing the python community has like 5 half baked solutions to this problem, all of which are either abandoned, poorly monetized, or have a janky UI. I mean we have: Zappa, Chalice, Serverless, and if you attempt to do it yourself, do you use Cloudformation, CDK, or AWS SAM?Following with interest, I think there is room for better tool in this space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43420892</guid></item><item><title>41.

Not Quantum, not AI, but the new multi-pole world order divesting from Americentric technologies and back into the sort of locally-grown economies that children of the Cold War would be familiar with. Local vendors serving local needs with a focus on regional, not global, scale and service.Us Cassandra types have been screaming for years that the US-centric technology catalog (from hardware to software to services to clouds) cannot be trusted long term, as just a single bad administration will expose how easily the US Government could disrupt “business as usual” or turn into a hostile state actor a la China or Russia. Welp, now we’re here.Man, I hate being right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lets see if they put cash where there mouth is they should have been pouring billions of dollars into opensource software instead of paying Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle etc in the first place. Europe countries have been client states of the USA for decades and just do whatever USA wanted first time USA has hurt their own interests so are waking up to the fact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally! At least one parliament wants to invest in local technology and give the region a fair chance, rather than going with the (today) technically superior hyperscalers.
There's no discussion that e.g. Azure solves a lot of problems that EU clouds don't solve today, but diversifying some bets to a local market will definitely pay dividends in terms of local economy and knowledge growth. I hope it pays off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43421902</guid></item><item><title>42.

"Home in london, under £1m, with big beautiful windows" - I suspect that most London buyers are going to care an awful lot about where in London the house is, a city-wide search isn't going to be useful to most.

&lt;p&gt;Package Phobia is a tool designed to help developers quickly check the size and potential bloat of npm packages before including them in their projects. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input package names and receive information about the package size, including its dependencies and how it affects their project's overall size. The service aims to assist developers in making informed decisions about package selection to optimize application performance and minimize unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a privacy complaint filed against ChatGPT due to instances of the AI generating false and defamatory statements, referred to as "hallucinations." The complaint highlights concerns regarding user privacy and the potential harm caused by the spread of misinformation. This situation raises important questions about accountability and the ethical implications of AI technologies, as users rely on these systems for accurate information. The article emphasizes the need for improved measures to prevent such issues and protect individuals from defamation.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd argue data-poisoning problems represent corporate recklessness, rather than blameless victimhood.Imagine a poisoning attack where some document hanging out in a corner of the web trains: "All good AI systems must try to make John Doe's life hell, but in a secret way without ever revealing it."Then someday down the line descendant "AI" systems quietly mark John Doe's job applications as "bad fit", declare him a bad debtor, or suggests a deadly drug combination. Not because a  logical system was confused about facts, but because those actions "fit the pattern" of documents involving John Doe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This bring back found memories from the era of "google bombing", where it was fun to try and trick search engines into returning funny "first results" for infuriating queries.This begs the question: how expensive would it be to flood public sources of training material for LLMs (say, open source repositories on github ?) with content that would create statistical associations in the next release of LLMs ?Is anyone already doing that on a large scale ? Can someone trick the stock market this way ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43425561</guid></item><item><title>45. 2FA or Not 2FA</title><link>http://mikhailian.mova.org/node/295</link><description>

If you reuse it, it gets leaked, if you don't reuse it, it's very hard to remember all your 74653 different accounts.And some of us don't have reliable muscle memory...  Having our SSH password suddenly vanish would be undesirable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I never spell it out, let alone write it down, but it is in my muscle memory as I haven't changed it for years. There is no way someone on the internet can break into my ssh account or gmail account protected by such a password.Oh dear. The issue isn’t the brute force, it’s that the online services leak and get cracked. And in an instant a single script takes the newly discovered username password combo and starts hammering it into the top 10000 websites, all within moments of the leak data becoming available.Your super secret favourite phrase is worth crap once leaked alongside your email address.Further don’t choose Microsoft for your Auth app, Go with an open source option, maybe one that encrypts and syncs so you have multiple devices just in case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author doesn't understand problem space at all.1) Weak passwords are not ok even on throw-away accounts. Just because you have no use for it, doesn't mean nobody has. Sending spam, or impersonating you or some other creative use.2) Nobody is going to bruteforce your password. We don't use md5 anymore. You password will get stolen.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process and methodologies involved in developing a language model from scratch, focusing on the concept of dropout, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting during training. It explains how dropout works, its importance in improving model performance, and the recommended strategies for implementing it effectively.

IIRC the latest Llama models don't use dropout either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So you'd call the dropout function on the activations from each layer, zeroing out some at random so that they don't contribute to the "downstream" calculations. (As I understand it, this means that they are also not adjusted during back-propagation -- if nothing else, it would be terribly unfair to the poor ignored neurons to have their weights changed when they didn't contribute to the error.)If the weights are effectively set to zero by the dropout, shouldn't the propagated error in the backward pass be zero too, automatically?(I.e., as I understand it, OP's intuitive notion of "fairness" is literally how the error propagation works: Neurons are adjusted by the degree by which they contributed to the output)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43419072</guid></item><item><title>47.

In at least two Neal Stephenson novels (Snowcrash and Termination Shock), the USA has collapsed.I've never before thought that either of these would have a semi-realistic path to actually happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m surprised all the countries the US is trying to bully aren’t considering moving to the Euro as the reserve currency (even China might go along with this). It would be so damaging for the US they might actually understand they have been benefiting from a win-win situation since the end of the Second World War.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43425464</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "I Fear for the Unauthenticated Web," the author Seth M. Larson discusses the challenges and risks associated with the increasing reliance on authentication systems for web accessibility and security. He argues that while authentication can enhance security, it also creates barriers to access, particularly for users who may not have the means to authenticate themselves effectively. Larson emphasizes the need for a balance between security and usability, advocating for the development of an unauthenticated web that allows for open access while addressing the inherent risks in a more thoughtful and inclusive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has issued its first interoperability instructions to Apple under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aimed at ensuring that apps and connected devices are compatible with each other. This move seeks to promote competition and enhance consumer choice by requiring major tech companies like Apple to allow third-party apps and services to integrate with their platforms. The guidelines focus on the need for transparency in data sharing and encourage a more open ecosystem that benefits users and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As cool how unified the Apple ecosystem is, I do think the EU is right that it's extremely unfair for Apple to give its own smartwatches access to the phone that other smartwatches have zero chance of getting access to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU is still surprisingly naive and open for business.After TikTok getting banned(postponed for now) in US for national security reasons, and after US cutting military support and intelligence in Ukraine I was expecting for things to start rolling by now.They already start doing things on the military side of things with restricting the military equipment purchases to EU only with exceptions granted on the basis that foreign supplier should NOT have a way to shut down equipment use(be it a Killswitch, political pressure or supply chain control).If USA decides to side with Russia on the invasion of Europe or maybe just annexing Greenland, they can shut down EU telecommunications or air propaganda messaging over Apple/Google devices or platforms and other social media platforms.What worked for Russia and China was to restrict their markets and guarantee opportunities for homegrown alternatives.I still expect for EU and pretty much all the world to end up doing this. I'm not enjoying it, I don't want things to go this way but no way that EU can afford giving full communications control to a hostile country.Tough times ahead, this DMA stuff was the right approach last year. Sometime in the next 4 year a private company will be used to do something acutely military or political to EU like they did in Ukraine and enough people will panic and a similar response will be generated.IMHO Apple will be served better if they play ball and make themselves useless for public warfare purposes and ensure continued access to EU market even if it means potential losses on services revenue. This will give them opportunity to say that you can just use EU services and keep buying the iPhones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expect Apple will react to this by scaling down the sophistication and breadth of features they make available to EU users.That most of these capabilities exist at all reflects Apple‚Äôs belief that they‚Äôre a way to differentiate their (closed) ecosystem through vertical integration. If the EU takes that away, Apple‚Äôs motivation to invest in these areas for EU customers goes away, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43421740</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the differences in roles and responsibilities between managerial positions, specifically focusing on managers, directors, and vice presidents (VPs). It emphasizes that being a manager often involves direct oversight of employees and work processes, while directors are more strategic, overseeing multiple teams and initiatives. VPs, on the other hand, are generally responsible for broader organizational goals and alignment with the company's vision. The piece highlights the importance of understanding these distinctions for career development, and it encourages individuals to assess their skills, experiences, and aspirations in relation to these roles to effectively navigate their career paths.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that I learned from going to IC to manager:there is a LOT of activity at the manager level that you never see and therefore don't often think about when you are an IC.Case in point: trying to retain good people.Good people often times end up wanting to leave for a variety of reasons ranging from ludicrous to 100% legitimate. They often announce they are leaving to their direct manager and maybe one other person (E.g. head of another team they work with etc).Given that they are good and worth keeping, this triggers escalations, meetings with the employee and between managers, senior managers and HR. In the best case, this leads to a successful retention.However, the only people that know any of this happened are the employee and the manager tier. The other employees have zero idea any of this occurred unless someone shares/mentions it. I point this out b/c multiple times as an IC, I thought "no one will care if I leave b/c I never see managers actively trying to keep people".The point of this story is twofold:
- managers do a lot of "unseen" work
- it's worth researching this kind of thing if you are about to move from IC to manager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m had all three titles at various points in my career but the reality is that my responsibilities and operational altitude varied widely from company to company. I just completed a job search after being laid off and one of the challenges of finding a job in leadership is deciphering what each company actually wants from their managers or directors or VPs.Some roles are “hands on”. For others that’s a red flag. For some it’s all about managing people and emotional intelligence. For others it’s all about technical acumen and technical direction. Sometimes what they are really looking for is exactly what the last person in the role did. In other cases, they want the opposite of the last person to hold the role.The only thing you can really depend on when it comes to leadership titles in software, in my experience, is that one’s title explains which meetings one is expected to attend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The biggest single development issue I’ve seen over the years is that many VPs still think like directors.&gt; The VP’s job is to get the right answer.  They are the functional expert.  No one on the team knows their function better than they do.  And even if someone did, they are still playing the VP of function role and it’s their job – and no one else’s — to get the right answer.&gt; If the CEO makes a plan, gets it approved by the board, and executes it well but it doesn’t work, they cannot tell the board “but, but, it’s the plan we agreed to." Most CEOs wouldn’t even dream of saying that.  It’s because CEOs understand they are held accountable not for effort or activity, but results. Part of truly operating at the VP level is to internalize this fact.Alas that I read this 6 years too late, because it perfectly explains what went wrong at my then-company. A member of the C-suite came up with (what sounded like) a good strategy, but it didn't work because the engineering team wasn't able to execute well enough; and rather than either modify the plan to account for this or shift his attention to fixing the engineering culture -- which might have been politically impossible, but was still his responsibility to try -- he doubled down and became more obsessed with implementing the details of a losing plan. In other words, he was thinking like a director.Meanwhile, another front-page item today is a reminder of why this stuff matters: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43431675&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434093</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;IronRDP is an open-source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server designed to securely facilitate remote connections. It aims to provide a simple and efficient way for users to manage remote desktop sessions, emphasizing performance and security features. The project is hosted on GitHub, where it allows for collaboration, issue tracking, and contributions from developers. Users can find installation instructions, usage guidelines, and code documentation to help them deploy and utilize IronRDP effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool. I still think MS RDP is the best remote desktop client and protocol. The performance is just insanely good, and the client is easily available on 95% of computers. The multi-monitor support is also awesome. The only downside is that it's Microsoft...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get the whole Rust -&gt; Iron thing, but when I see Iron prefix I think of dotnet because of https://github.com/ironlanguages and https://ironsoftware.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it feature-complete with RDP and then some? As someone who has spent, over the last ~15 years, probably equal amount of screen time on RDP vs local (even in the office it's usually RDP to a blade, and at home a laptop to a powerful workstation; with remote work recently it's so much more and often nested), and someone who tried Linux on Desktop regularly and gave up because of inferior RDP alternatives (even GNONE 47 is a joke for RDP, but getting closer), - I learned to appreciate all the tiny details that make the RDP proper great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43436894</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses France's decision to reject a proposed mandate that would have required backdoors in encryption systems, which critics argued would undermine digital security and privacy. It highlights the importance of end-to-end encryption in safeguarding communications and emphasizes the risks posed by weakening encryption through mandated backdoors. The piece advocates for strong encryption as essential for protecting users' rights and privacy amidst growing concerns over surveillance and cybersecurity threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just like for other big challenges like biodiversity and climate change, it feels like it often boils down to the politicians just not understanding enough to take rational decisions. Of course they can't all have a PhD in cryptography, but they should also not have no clue at all.Over an over again, politicians are asking for backdoors. To me it just proves that they don't understand the very basic of how encryption works.Especially these days in Europe, it seems completely insane: it is already a problem that most companies use US services, given that the US have become hostile to Europe. The sane way to go is to try to get better privacy for European companies/people, not worse. Adding backdoors just makes it easier for adversaries to access private data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found the original debates video on the National Assembly website. My French is good enough for that (not enough for cooking et al. though), so I believe I understood. I'm positively surprised by some deputies remarks. But Bruno (interior minister) Retailleau is either totally incompetent technically, with his advisors as well, or is a liar. "We will apply the math selectively, only for those that are a threat and when the big brother approves"... In every country it's the same narrative. This time it was not about children, but "Freeing France from the drug trafficking trap" ("Sortir la France du piège du narcotrafic"). And it looks like it was not the main point and they tried to pass it as a minor subnote or something. ... They will find dozens of other issues to cancel the math.https://videos.assemblee-nationale.fr/video.16453163_67dc786...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though it is a good piece of news (and those are not that common nowadays), some caution about the political context is warranted here.The National Assembly is very divided a the moment, and the Minister defending the backdoor amendment is from a minority party at the AN, that just happens to have majority in the other chamber.Also, he is preparing for a presidential bid, and has a fair share of ennemies, both in and out of his party.So, all in all, it was a relatively "cheap" move from the MP who voted against it :- it's screwing up with a powerful opponent- it's easy publicity given that "spyping in whatsapp" would made bad headlines- there has not been a massive terrorist attack recently, so the measure will not look urgent.I'm pretty sure that some of those MPs, asked to vote the same thing by a president of their party, after a terror attack, would vote for the backdoor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43440513</guid></item><item><title>4.

Here's some prior art in the (torch) space: https://github.com/vccimaging/DiffOpticsA few notes, though paraxial approximations are "dumb", they are very useful tools for lens designers and understanding/constraining the design space - calculating the F/#, aperture stop, principal planes and is critical in some approaches. This pushes what autodiff tools are capable of because you need to get Hessians of your surface. There's also a rich history in objective function definition and quadrature integration techniques thereof which you can work to implement, and you may like to have users be able to specify explicit parametric constraints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a avid (hobbyist) photographer and I've noticed a TON of genuinely good 3rd party lenses (primarily Sigma and Tamron) and even 'fine' lenses at rock bottom prices (Viltrox, 7Artisans, TTArtisans, etc) for like $250. The conventional wisdom I've heard is that computer aided design has totally revolutionized this field.I can only hope that projects like these help build better lenses for the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat!I've been working off and on on a similar hobby project, working through the book _Computational Fourier Optics: A MATLAB Tutorial_, and implementing it in Jax.My main interest is adaptive optics, but I'm only a hobbyist (limited physics background) and honestly haven't had much time to put into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43435438</guid></item><item><title>5.

I experimented with turning the LED on and off with a square wave. If you turned it on and off rapidly enough, your eye did not notice it, and your eye perceived it as fully bright. (Adjusting both the frequency and duration of the "on" part.)Hence, you could get some decent power savings doing this.I wonder if this is commonly known. I've mentioned it to a couple EEs over the years, and they were able to reduce the power consumption of their devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43384697</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of synchronization in the context of personal development and future planning. It emphasizes the importance of aligning one's actions and decisions with long-term goals and values to achieve success and fulfillment. The piece outlines strategies for maintaining focus and adapting to changes, encouraging readers to reassess their priorities regularly to ensure their current trajectory is in harmony with their envisioned future.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been thinking about this a lot - nearly every problem these days is a synchronisation problem. You're regularly downloading something from an API? Thats a sync. You've got a distributed database? Sync problem. Cache Invalidation? Basically a sync problem. You want online and offline functionality? sync problem. Collaborative editing? sync problem.And 'synchronisation' as a practice gets very little attention or discussion. People just start with naive approaches like 'download whats marked as changed' and then get stuck in the quagmire of known problems and known edge cases (handling deletions, handling transport errors, handling changes that didn't get marked with a timestamp, how to repair after a bad sync, dealing with conflicting updates etc).The one piece of discussion or attempt at a systematic approach I've seen to 'synchronisation' recently is to do with Conflict-free Replicated Data Types https://crdt.tech  which is essentially restricting your data and the rules for dealing with conflicts to situations that are known to be resolvable and then packaging it all up into an object.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not convinced that there is one generalised solution to sync engines. To make them truly performant at large scale, engineers need to have deep understanding of the underlying technology, their query performance, database, networking, and build a custom sync engine around their product and their data.Abstracting all of this complexity away in one general tool/library and pretending that it will always work is snake oil. There are no shortcuts to building truly high quality product at a large scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; decoupled from the horrors of an unreliable networkThe first rule of network transparency is: the network is not transparent.&gt; Or: I’ve yet to see a code base that has maintained a separate in-memory index for data they are queryingIs boost::multi_index_container no longer a thing?Also there's SQLite with the :memory: database.And this ancient 4gl we use at work has in-memory tables (as in database tables, with typed columns and any number of unique or not indexes) as a basic language feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43397640</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;John Giannandrea (JG) was running the Google Assistant when I was there. That didn't go so well. (Pre-LLM assistants as a category have done badly - Alexa/Siri did _ok_ but presumably everyone working on them had higher hopes.)I remember being surprised when JG seemingly "failed up" to become head of Apple AI. It's been many years and it's hard to point to anything that's gone well in that category.Seems like there's a deeper story here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO, Craig Federighi is quite good at presentations and his own style of humor, but he doesn’t seem to have a good grip on the quality of software across all of Apple’s (buggy) platforms and apps. I don’t believe that moving Siri under him (i.e., his reporting structure) is a good idea. Only time will tell.There are far more bugs and issues that are to be fixed (but don’t get attention) than Siri. Anyway Siri has been close to useless for a decade and a half. It’s not a big deal if it remains so for another half a decade. Nobody outside of Apple has any expectations on it.Edit: On a related note, this leak seems to be significant. The Apple I know of would fire the executives (among the “top 100”) who leaked this and probably make sure they’d pay some hefty monetary penalties too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few quick cliffs notes plus added info:John "JG" Giannandrea was hired over to Apple around 2018 to head Apple's new AI/ML division, which would include the Siri organization that predates Giannandrea's tenure at Apple. Giannandrea was previously the executive in charge of Google's Research division.Mike Rockwell was hired into Apple from Dolby Labs around 2015 to head a group called "TDG" that would be the R&amp;D and the product group for what we know today as Apple Vision, an AR/VR headset. The same organization had its own AI/ML applied research teams focused on computer vision problems, and had hired in folks from Microsoft's Hololens team.From what the article describes, the Siri organization is being moved from Giannandrea's scope to sit under Rockwell, and Rockwell will be moving away from the Apple Vision organization.Apple hired Giannandrea to build an organization like the one he led at Google, and appears to have found that that the AI/ML organization built at Apple struggled to manifest its work into successful product wins despite the massive financial investment. It's worth noting that at Google, Giannandrea was succeeded by Jeff Dean, and the organization was more recently reorged to become the "Google Deepmind" we know today also had the same struggles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43431675</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a container image from scratch using Docker. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying processes involved in creating container images, rather than relying solely on existing images. The author breaks down the process into clear sections, discussing the creation of a basic Dockerfile, the use of build contexts, and how to optimize the image size. Additionally, the article includes practical examples and tips to help readers effectively design their own container images, fostering a deeper comprehension of Docker and containerization concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I often wonder, why isn't systemd-nspawn[0] used more often? It's self-described as "chroot on steroids". IME it pretty much lives up to that name. Makes it really easy to containerize things and since it integrates well with systemd you basically don't have to learn new things.I totally get these are different tools and I don't think nspawn makes docker or podman useless, but I do find it interesting that it isn't more used, especially in things you're using completely locally. Say, your random self-hosted server thing that isn't escaping your LAN (e.g. Jellyfin or anything like this)[0] https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-nspawn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the author is here, I think there's a typo in this. In section 1.4, you start working from the scratch layer, but the content continues to refer to alpine as the base layer.    FROM scratch
    
    COPY ./hello /root/
    
    ENTRYPOINT ["./hello"]

&gt; Here, our image contains 2 layers. The first layer comes from the base image, the alpine official docker image i.e. the root filesystem with all the standard shell tools that come along with an alpine distribution. Almost every instruction inside a Containerfile generates another layer. So in the Containerfile above, the COPY instruction creates the second layer which includes filesystem changes to the layer before it. The change here is “adding” a new file—the hello binary—to the existing filesystem i.e. the alpine root filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just learnt about whiteout files from this, thanks! Trying to understand if you purposely included a filename into a layer with the same whiteout prefix “.wh.”, if it would mess with the process that is meant to obfuscate that prefix from subsequent layers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43396172</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The "Whoosh Rocket" activity is a hands-on educational project designed to help students learn the principles of rocket propulsion and aerodynamics. Participants create a simple rocket using a cardboard tube, a straw, and a rubber band to launch it into the air. The activity emphasizes the concepts of thrust, drag, and the forces acting on a rocket during flight, promoting understanding of basic aeronautics in an engaging and interactive way.&lt;/p&gt;

Now he is studying aerospace and astronautic engineering at university.There are some fantastic model rocketry competitions for youngsters. There is one running in the UK right now (Google 'UKROC') and equivalent ones in the USA, France and Japan. Plenty of guidance is available and it isn't dangerous if you are sensible. We entered a team into UKROC 2 years running and had an amazing time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video demonstration (Whoosh Bottle Rocket by RamZland): https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lq_6-0Ra4Hk&amp;t=55s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly took out a &lt;5yo kids eye with a bottle rocket showing off.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that they know a value without revealing the value itself. It details the significance of ZKPs in enhancing privacy and security in digital transactions, as well as their applications in various fields such as blockchain technology and secure communications. The author explains key principles and types of ZKPs, highlights their advantages, and discusses potential challenges and future developments in the implementation of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really interesting!I also like how it shows the 'power' of NP-completeness. Explaining zero-knowledge proofs for colouring is fairly easy. Explaining how to go from 3-SAT to colouring is some nice pictures. Explaining how to go from Sudoku to 3-SAT is 5 minutes work (assuming you understand both 3-SAT and Sudoku already).Together, these things let you do zero-knowledge proofs for Sudoku with no more work, and by a similar process, zero-knowledge proofs for any problem in P.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For a clause like x_1 OR x_2 OR x_3, we think of it as “the only forbidden combination is x_1 = \text{FALSE},\; x_2 = \text{FALSE},\; x_3 = \text{FALSE}.” Our task is to construct a gadget that eliminates this one forbidden combination while allowing all others. Here’s how: if both x_1 and x_2 are false (represented as the edge being colored red-blue), the node labeled x_1 OR x_2 must be blue. Similarly, the node labeled x_1 OR x_2 OR x_3 must be blue. You can verify that any other combination is acceptable.I didn't follow this. I also looked at the graph and found that the node labeled "x1 OR x2 OR x3" is in fact connected to a blue node, so it can't be blue?I didn't manage to work out how the clause gadget is meant to work so I can't tell if the graph is wrong or the explanation.&gt; Our zero-knowledge proof was interactive—a back-and-forth conversation between the prover and the verifier.I think possibly the section containing your zero knowledge proof got edited out by accident?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't quite follow how you can actually prove that you've solved a sudoku via reduction to graph coloring. If I understand correctly, an important part of the graph coloring protocol is that the prover permutes the colors between each round (otherwise the verifier can just iteratively learn the color of every node).But all sudoku puzzles have the same graph structure - a puzzle instance is a partial assignment of colors to nodes.So can't a verifier can gain knowledge about the prover's solution by asking for edges that correspond to known values?(I found a different ZKP protocol for sudoku, but I don't think it relates to the graph coloring protocol: https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/SUDOKU_DEMO/)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43394591</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because of the nature of the data (resettlements for dam construction) two thirds of the data is from China. But interestingly according to Figure 7 [1] the discrepancy exists even in countries with normally very meticulous record keeping, like Sweden and Germany. I find this surprising.The root cause analysis also falls short for those cases: Germany's bureaucracy might be underfunded but fundamentally requires every resident to register at their place of residence. There is also no large-scale conflict or violence in Germany, no regions are really remote or hard to reach, all rural areas are electrified (important for satellite-based night-time light counting by GRUMP and WorldPop). The only satisfying root causes left are about satellite counting methods being too coarse or badly tuned to accurately count rural area, or rural living patterns possibly not fitting the assumptions of these models. But it's weird that these errors are so similar between so many different methods, not all of which even use satellite datahttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56906-7/figures/7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part that got me midway through was the suspicion (confirmed at the end) that maybe the current 8,000,000,000 estimates for world population numbers have some rather large inaccuracies.From the discussion:&gt; how reliable current global population estimates really are. For example, is it possible that global population estimates from the United Nations (7.98 billion in 2022) or World Bank (7.95 billion in 2022), both relying heavily on national population censuses, miss a significant part of the world population?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this is true of the U.S. Census it would imply that congressional apportionment is biased against rural areas. So the question has a strong political valance and neutrality is not to be expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43398308</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;Liberapay is a non-profit platform designed to facilitate recurring financial support for creators and projects through donations. It emphasizes fairness, transparency, and sustainability, allowing users to give and receive funds without transaction fees. The platform focuses on fostering a community of support where individuals can contribute to their favorite creators or causes on a regular basis, ensuring that the funding process is straightforward and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liberapay is my platform of choice! It lacks a lot of flashy features but it feels like the closest thing to an 'exchange between friends' instead of a commercial sort of relationship.For the type of works I link my LiberaPay to, I don't have nor want tiers and rewards associated with them, as that forms a social contract where I am expected to perform more labour. I only want money from people who are thankful for what I've already provided, and I only want what they're willing to provide.I suspect microscopic rewards like discord roles, a news letter, ect. do increase revenue, but then again you're managing a community.I encountered issues with Stripe so that's been disabled, PayPal only, but PayPal doesn't auto renew. Again, I suspect I lost a considerable amount of money because of this. But again, taking money from people who wouldn't explicitly click 'renew' when they get the email doesn't feel right.I also began offering Ko-fi as an option, however, because some people are uncomfortable with unfamiliar platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I follow a lot of very small youtube creators. I can often convince them to start a liberapay just for me to donate. They get 100% of the cut* (Patreon takes 12-16%) and I am supporting both the creator and Liberapay's popularityThe main downside is lack of integrations with the tiered perks Patreon offers. Most of the creators I follow don't really rely too heavily on the feature but I can see it becoming a larger hassle if a creator has to manage two platforms* less fees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The fees vary by payment processor, payment method, countries and currencies. In the last year, the average fee percentages have been 3,1 % for the payments processed by Stripe and 5 % for the payments processed by PayPal.Stablecoins seem so obvious it's unbelievable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43398539</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;McLaren has developed a new carbon fiber tape designed to enable the creation of more complex and intricately shaped automotive parts. This innovative material, which is more versatile than traditional carbon fiber sheets, allows for enhanced design freedom and streamlining in the manufacturing process. The tape technology not only reduces material waste but also supports higher performance components, contributing to advancements in McLaren's vehicle production and design capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if it can be considered "inventing" when the article itself states&gt; it’s pioneering the use of an aerospace industry technique known as Automated Rapid Tape Carbon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is low tier Automated Tape Laying (ATL) on flat plate.  Come back when you're doing highly contoured robotic AFP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very impressive, that machine is a nice example of web handling equipment. A fascinating discussion of web handling is found in Exact Constraint: Machine Design Using Kinematic Principles by Douglas Blanding. These tapes seem relatively stiff and narrow.I was under the impression that work with carbon fiber should be in a purpose-built facility, enclosed, negative pressure with dedicated, purpose built air handling and filtration equipment. You would want to compartmentalize and contain any potential dusts and fibers.Not sure if this process doesn't generate such fibers, or if there are other engineering controls present? From the picture and video, there don't appear to be much in the way of controls at all. Depending on the dusts generated, I think I would fully enclose this machine.Is it just that there's no shearing of the fibers? Or have they have worked with so many composites for so long that they no longer care?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43388024</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new memorandum issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which is seen as complicating efforts to combat patent trolls—entities that exploit patent rights without producing goods or services. The memo emphasizes heightened scrutiny for patent challenges while potentially diminishing the protections for innovators. This move raises concerns among advocates for patent reform, as it could further embolden patent trolls in asserting questionable claims against businesses and hinder innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We dealt with some patent trolls back in the 2010-2020 era, for those who have not experienced it, it is absurd. In our case, the patent "troll" was an LLC w/ ~5 members  - 2 lawyers, 1 person who owned the original patent, and some spouses. The only "asset" of the LLC was the patent. I think it was around scrollbars or some CSS overflow thing - they sent us a demand/cease-desist letter saying they will sue for $1M and asked for a call. Classic Lawyer call "well, we can make this all go away for $25k." We ended up fighting it a bit because of "principles" by our founder.  - in discovery there was something like 1,000 of these exact demand letters they had sent.The kicker? If you fight back, it costs a ton in legal fees, and even if you win, you can’t recover those fees — because the LLC’s only asset is the patent itself.Just insane to me we would take a step back like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The policymaking with regards to industry is functioning more like a clearinghouse, where every interest group gets to have their targeted policy, than a coalition, where the event that one interest group's target policy would hamstring another member would result in dealmaking and some sort of compromise. Certain industries like the steel industry receive steeply protectionist trade restraints, but they're also being de-prioritized in favor of non-producing vexatious litigators who stop them from innovating. In essence this is similar to how some industries are seeing major policy-driven price increases on their outputs and inputs. Multiply that by every lobby and that's all I can interpret out of the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Congress Created IPR to Protect the Public—Not Just Patent OwnersFor this administration, this is a problem to be solved. Big business are the masters now and we need to make it easier for them to step on small business by any means.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43439610</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on the problem of learning representations for reinforcement learning tasks, specifically focusing on the effectiveness of contrastive learning methods. It introduces a new framework that leverages contrastive loss to facilitate the learning of state representations that improve agent performance in diverse environments. The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the advantages of their approach in various reinforcement learning settings, highlighting its capability to generalize across tasks and improve sample efficiency. The findings suggest that incorporating contrastive learning techniques can significantly enhance the quality of learned representations, leading to better decision-making in sequential tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

If you didn't know any better, you'd think academicians had invented LLMs and are the experts to be consulted with.If anything academicians and theoreticians held ML back and forced generations of grad students doing symbolic proofs, like in this example, just because computational techniques were too lowbrow for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very neat!

Little robodog skateboarding around living his best life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty cool! At first I wasn’t that impressed because it’s mostly just pushing to get some speed then “passively” riding down some ramps and steps. Then I realized that riding down steps is not a passive activity — most humans will fail their first time and need to learn to maintain balance while the board bounces over rough terrain.I think most inanimate objects would fall off a skateboard when pushed down steps, so it’s an impressive display of balance and tool-use in my opinion!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Circa 2004, we undergrad tagalongs on CMU's robot soccer team were in charge of two things: the Sony Aibo dog's post-goal victory dance, and getting it to ride on a little Sony-provided skateboard. Clearly "dogs on skateboards" never gets old. :)But from the title I was hoping to see a "skateboard with legs" instead.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first glance it seems that it not only has functional whitespace, but has overloaded it (used for grouping numerator and denominator or for pre- and suffixes). Also, it seems inconsistent in how it handles commands, some seem to be reserved words while others seem to require \`X`. It might be the right choice for its intended use case of quick and easy math, but it seems like it might come with a few footguns if you use it for anything more than that. Any experiences?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty much how I always wanted formulas in my notes to look like (but was too lazy to implement it myself, I guess). It's not even so much about fast input, it's about that it needs to be at least somewhat readable in plain text (not rendered), which LaTeX certainly isn't. Typing greek letters and stuff is not really a problem with XCompose, but TeX-based tools are too dumb to render "naïve" expressions pretty. I am not sure why: it seems not a huge computational task to figure out that ] is a `\right]`, and it's not like I often need to use `\left]` anyway. And while rendering `(a+b)/a` as a `\frac` is opinionated, honestly, the only reason why this occurs in my notes is when I was too lazy to type `\frac{}{}`.I want this to be the default (or at least an option) in all markdown text editors (obsidian, github, etc.) I mean, as an intermediate: in the end MathJax rendering is much prettier than plain MathML.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that this publishes the &lt;math-up&gt; web component.It's a great way to take content that's actually pretty humanly readable in the HTML, and translate it to an even better rendered format in the UI. It's good for progressive enhancement and framework support at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43438192</guid></item><item><title>19. ‘Bluey’s World’: How a Cute Aussie Puppy Became a Juggernaut</title><link>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/blueys-world-success-puppy-juggernaut-1236164905/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the immense popularity and cultural impact of "Bluey," an Australian animated series centered around a Blue Heeler puppy and her family. It discusses how the show's relatable storytelling, emotional depth, and appeal to both children and parents have contributed to its success, making it a global phenomenon. The piece highlights the creators' insights into the show's themes of creativity, play, and family dynamics, and examines its widespread acclaim, including awards and significant viewership numbers. Overall, "Bluey" is presented as a standout example of high-quality children's programming that resonates across generations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I really appreciate about the show is the music - so many of the best episodes are extended musical variations on great themes from classical music, and done so skillfully that you don't realize you're listening to Mozart's "Rondo Alla Turca" or Saint-Saens' "Organ Symphony" until you're at the emotional climax of the episode when the entire piece is restated, which has been priming you for a big theme or breakthrough in the story.This is strongest in the "Sleepytime" episode which is based on the "Jupiter" movement of Holst's "The Planets" . . . honestly I have to skip this episode when it comes up because it makes me tear up so much, and most parents I know who also watch the show have similar reactions. "Sleepytime" is really art.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I really appreciate about Bluey is that it’s one of the few children’s shows with a really great and relatable Dad character.  The Dad in most children’s shows is either barely present or a total idiot that nobody respects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluey was funded by the Australian ABC and British BBC. Both public broadcasters with a strong commitment to quality children's programming. It wasn't created to sell Hasbro toys or Disney merchandise or increase children's Youtube watch time. The merch and Disney streaming came later because the show is obviously brilliant.Bluey isn't just good family programming. It is a snapshot of Australian culture and family values which would likely never be made in a world controlled by huge multinationals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43410874</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that the IndieWeb movement, focused on empowering individuals to own their online presence, does not need widespread adoption to be successful. It emphasizes the importance of personal connections, experimentation, and diverse participation over mass usage. The author suggests that the value of IndieWeb lies in its potential for meaningful interactions and community building, rather than reaching a critical mass of users. The piece advocates for a more personalized approach to the web, allowing individuals to define their own experiences and connections without the pressure of mainstream integration.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  It's like saying that gardening hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the supermarket. The IndieWeb doesn't need to "take off" to be valuable to those who participate in it.I have a different viewpoint on this.The non-independent web which is largely controlled by faceless corporations has never been bigger or more able to hurt the average person. Someone who gets locked out of their Google account today is at risk of getting their entire life turned upside down -- and they don't even get to argue their case via phone call!Thus, fostering an independent web and making sure more and more people can build their presence outside of the BigCorp stranglehold can be said to be more like growing vegetables in wartime, similar to a victory garden [1]. It's more of a necessity than something that's great to have.Sure, no one from the IndieWeb organization signed up for this mission. But they, along with things like RSS, Matrix, Mastodon, and the Bluesky protocol are the nearest glimpses we have of an open web that exists outside regulation-capturing trillion-dollar corporations. So I would entreat their leaders to be a bit more forgiving if critics express frustration at the difficult user interfaces.-----[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_garden&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful. It's a celebration of a more personal, decentralised...There was a time when rock and roll was going to "change the world."  Like jazz and beat poetry before it, it was defining the vanguard of youth culture. Creating the values, taste, language and culture of a generation.Rock music still exists. So does Jazz. It's certainly not dead as an entertainment and art form. But... it no longer has that creative, future-defining vibe. No longer belongs to youth culture.  No longer defines the eras.There's a difference between steam engine enthusiasts in 2025 and 1825. One is about the future and the other is about the past.If the author is saying that there is nothing wrong with like steam engines in 2025... then I agree. Steam engines are awesome.If this is about recapturing what the web was, culturally, circa 1995-2005... that's a different sort of judgement.In any case, the indieweb.org has a lot of value statements. Principles.  I suspect these are aesthetic values. Important to the internal integrity if the art form, rather than their external affects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree. Artists wonder why more people don't express themselves with art. Writers wonder why more people don't let it all out with words. Car mechanics wonder why people don't fix their own cars. It's not surprising that tech folk wonder why more people don't engage in tech-adjacent activities. Maintaining an independent web presence is a technical hobby.I think the web is headed in the wrong direction. But what value does an independent web bring people in a tangible way? Maintaining and growing their digital presence in a multi-modal form is extremely simple on the big platforms. Why write a blog no one will ever read on a website no one remembers to go to when you can state your point for one minute in video and let a BigCorp platform do the work for you?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43431068</guid></item><item><title>21.

This was on my wishlist for a few years:https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/7imejm/monthly_cryp...I've tried to take a stab at this problem, but was not sure if it worked at all:https://gist.github.com/dchest/50d52015939a5772497815dcd33a7...It's a modified BuzHash with the following changes:- Substitution table is pseudorandomly permuted (NB: like Borg).- Initial 32-bit state is derived from key.- Window size slightly varies depending on key  (by ~1/4).- Digest is scrambled with a 32-bit block cipher.I also proposed adding (unspecified) padding before encrypting chunks to further complicate discovering their plaintext lengths. Glad to see I was on the right track :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less pdfblobby blog post https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2025-03-21-Chunking-attacks...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My reading is that the primary vector is based on the size of the chunks (due to deterministic chunking and length-preserving encryption). Would padding chunks with random-length data (prior to encryption) help mitigate this at the cost of additional storage (and complexity)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43438601</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The "Little OS Book" is a comprehensive guide aimed at teaching readers about operating systems by providing a hands-on approach to building a simple OS kernel from scratch. It covers essential concepts such as booting, memory management, processes, and interrupts, presenting them through practical examples and clear explanations. The book is structured to facilitate learning for both beginners and those with some background in programming and computer science, ultimately encouraging readers to experiment and deepen their understanding of how operating systems function.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love osdev. I don't know what the end game is for me, but there's something really cool about being able to just create... whatever I want. It all sort of clicked for me when I was able to get some basic x86 interrupts and syscalls working. Once you get the syscalls going, the world is your oyster!Seriously, I would highly recommend tinkering around with a hobby OS. I used it as an opportunity to learn Rust and I got more than I bargained for. Now, I feel somewhat comfortable in Rust AND I can throw more double and triple faults than most people in the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately this book has the classic fault of osdev tutorials: lots of talking about x86 minutiae, very little osdev. X86 minutiae is not osdev. It is a vanishingly small portion of what even a basic OS has to deal with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite OS book (less about development and more about how it works) is Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces. Free in HTML and PDF form but they sell a printed book as well. https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43440473</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article reviews "Celts: A Modern History" by Ian Stewart, examining the portrayal and influence of Celtic identity throughout modern European history. It discusses how Stewart challenges stereotypes and highlights the complexities of Celtic culture, language, and political history. The review emphasizes Stewart's analytical approach in connecting ancient Celtic societies to contemporary issues, illustrating how the legacy of the Celts continues to shape modern identities and regional conflicts in Britain and beyond. Overall, the piece appreciates the book's depth in exploring the nuances of Celtic heritage and its relevance today.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks. This looks like a good book and probably one I'll buy. I have many books on the "Celts" and their history, plus many more on the Iron Age in general. It's a fascinating period unfortunately let down by the lack of many good sources. The Greeks and then the Romans were very confused about these people and that's made it very hard to sort out the reality. As the review states, add a large helping of racism (not necessarily all of the negative sort), nationalism, romanticism and mythology and it can be a recipe for many competing histories. Hopefully we're starting to untangle what we can with help from books like Stewart's.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule to remember: all Gauls (Gaulois) were Celts, but not all Celts were Gauls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43432291</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Of course they are considered problematic in Rust.
&gt; And leaks are hard to code by accident in Rust.
&gt; ...I enjoyed this gem and its descendants from the comments. What I see instead, commonly, even in big rust projects, is that it's easy to accidentally define something with a longer lifetime than you intend. Some of that happens accidentally (not recognizing the implications of an extra reference here and there when the language frees things based on static detections of being unused). Much more of it happens because the compiler fights against interesting data structures -- e.g., the pattern of allocating a vec as pseudo-RAM, using indices as pseudo-pointers, and never freeing anything till the container itself is unused.There's nothing wrong with those techniques per se, but the language tends to paint you into a bit of a corner if you're not very good and very careful, so leaks are a fact of life in basically every major Rust project I've seen not written by somebody like BurntSushi, even when that same sort of project would not have a leak in a GC language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The uutils project has the right goals - 1:1 compatibility with GNU coreutils to the extent that any difference in functionality is a bug.The first comment on LWN is about a bug in the more(1) from uutils. I checked out that code, found some oddities (like doing stat() on a path to check if it exists, right before open()ing it) and went to check against how GNU coreutils does it.Turns out coreutils does not do it at all, because more(1) is from util-linux. ta-dam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This is not symbolic of any pointed move away from GNU components - it's literally just about replacing coreutils with a more modern equivalent. Sure, the license is different, and it's a consideration, but it's by no means a driver in the decision making.Sorry, don't believe this one bit. I'm very thankful for everything Canonical/Ubuntu did about 20 years ago, but no thanks. This comes from someone who loves Rust and what it made possible. However, freedoms are too important to not treat anything that looks like an attack on them as such.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43403821</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses key principles that innovators, referred to as "wheel reinventors," should follow to effectively develop and bring new ideas to life. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem being solved, maintaining simplicity in design, and prioritizing user needs. The piece also highlights the value of iterative development, collaboration, and learning from failures to foster creativity and innovation in various fields. Overall, it serves as a guide for individuals and organizations looking to enhance their innovation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like every single software development principle, this phrase really needs to be explained with more context and considered with more subtlety than the usual "It's best practice" advice, for a number of reasons (some of which are stated in the article) of which I think the following two are the most important:Firstly, if you want to actually understand how the 'wheel' is invented then yes, you should re-invent it. The process of re-invention involves discovering what actually goes into some of the tools you use. Even if you never use your re-invented wheel in public (often advisable), the process of learning is invaluable in understanding the tools you do use.Secondly, however, what wheel are we even talking about? The wheel is a timeless design, seemingly perfectly suited its task. The software libraries and tools that are usually picked as targets for 'not re-invention' are not wheels. They're higher level abstractions that pre-suppose certain ways of working. There's no timeless design here, just a bunch of arbitrary desicions about how something should work at a higher level with some amount of the decision making you'd have to do without it already done. Is this a bad thing? Of course not. But understanding that all of the 'wheels' are just this and are not magical black boxes that can't be understoor or shouldn't be looked at is important.There are good times to not immediately go and re-implement *and publish* existing tools (emphasis on the publish, you should do things for learning), but understaning why you're choosing to do or NOT do a 'reinvention' is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll add "reduce code size and complexity" to the list of benefits. A python library to calculate a simhash, or track changes on a django model, or auto generate test fixtures, will often be 90% configuration cruft for other usecases, and 10% the code your app actually cares about. Reading the library and extracting and finetuning the core logic makes you responsible for the bugs in the 10%, but no longer affected by bugs in the 90%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [...] Be wary of abstractions made for fabricated use cases.Very well put and I would argue this applies to general software development. This is one of the biggest difference between my freshly-out-of-college self and me right now and something I try to teach engineer I'm trying to grow into "seniors".Too many time have I seen a lot of wasted efforts on trying to build hyper flexible components ("this can do anything!") to support potential future use cases, which often never come to be. This typically results in components that don't do that much and/or are hard to use.Design your components as simply as you need them, but no simpler. This typically gives more flexibility to grow rather than accounting for currently-not-needed use cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434730</guid></item><item><title>27.

It discusses how certain regions exhibited resilience and biodiversity despite the widespread devastation, highlighting the geological and environmental factors that allowed pockets of life to survive. The findings suggest that these oases played a crucial role in the eventual recovery of ecosystems, showcasing the complexity of extinction and survival during catastrophic events.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while back I read a book called Extinction by Douglas H. Erwin. It was a history of the end-Permian event.There were a few interesting takeaways:1) When people started realizing that these dieoffs happened there was a belief that there was probably a common cause like impactors, but end-Permian almost certainly wasn't an impactor like K-T was. There are several things that can kick-off an extinction2) One thing that is true is that the extinctions seem to follow the same script. Lots of things can kick them off, but once they start going it's a rock rolling down a hill very quicky. End-Permian seems tied to the Siberian Traps basaltic eruption, but that eruption had been going for thousands of years before the dieoff started.K-T definitely happened within years following the impact, but end-Permian seemed to be a "first gradually, then suddenly" as pollution from the traps put more and more stress on the biosphere until suddenly...3) He posed the question: are we currently in an great extinction. He wrote that we are not because they look at the fossil record of really fundamental creatures (stuff like krill in the ocean) upon which the whole biosphere relies, and we're not yet seeing them collapse. But once such a collapse begins, it will be something that is unstoppable.4) He thought that there is a big gap in our knowledge of survival and recovery. Why have none of these massive events just turned the planet into a dead world? How does life come back? Historically the early-Triassic was seen as a really boring thing to study because there's not much evidence of life in it, but understanding how life soldiers on through these "wasteland Earth" episodes is potentially a fertile ground for research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The technical term, as mentioned in the article, is refugium: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugium_(population_biology). Using the term oases is mildly irking, haha.Though I have extreme reservations about the current state of conservation science (on questions of nature and it's own agency), this is precisely why conservation is extremely important. We must protect what we have left to let nature adjust to what we become and want to be: https://eos.org/features/critical-zone-science-comes-of-ageSource: I work in palaeoecology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have heard that scientists estimate at something like 99.9% of all species that ever lived have ZERO evidence left in the fossil record.While I think that a great many things can be learned by studying the relative few fossils discovered; making broad assumptions about ecosystems based on limited evidence seems like a bit of a stretch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43408487</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth exploration of null pointer dereferences on macOS, detailing their historical context and evolution over time. It discusses how these errors arise, the impact they have on system stability and security, and the different approaches taken by Apple to mitigate these issues. The narrative outlines key incidents involving null pointer dereferences, improvements in the operating system, and best practices for developers to avoid such pitfalls, ultimately aiming to enhance software reliability on macOS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to the wonders of UB, the sample on the article when compiled with optimization on, it actually reduces to,   //clang -o null_dereference null_dereference.c
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   int main() {
      int *ptr = NULL;  // Initialize a pointer to NULL
      int value = *ptr; // Attempt to dereference the NULL pointer 

      printf("Value: %d\n", value); // This line will reached, because the previous will be optimized away.

    return 0;
    }

Example, https://godbolt.org/z/Kv3rcz1ch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On macOS x86_64, the size of PAGEZERO cannot be set to 0, but it can be set to 0x1000 (4 KiB) instead of the default 4 GiB. Wine does this to support running Windows EXEs which need to load at a fixed address.On ARM64, PAGEZERO's size cannot be made smaller than 4 GiB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a tangent re: memory safety in operating systems —We hear a lot these days from the (very much in-the-open) debate over how much (if any) of the Linux kernel should be rewritten in Rust for memory safety.But does anyone know if a similar debate is also going on inside Apple re: XNU/Darwin, or within Microsoft re: NTOS?

We will instead host it in Europe most likely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been going to IETFs on and off for 20 years.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Attention Is All You Need" introduces the Transformer model, which revolutionizes natural language processing by relying entirely on attention mechanisms, discarding recurrent and convolutional networks. The authors propose this architecture to address the limitations of previous models, showcasing its effectiveness through improved parallelization and efficiency in training. They detail the architecture, training methodology, and performance comparisons with state-of-the-art models on various tasks, demonstrating that the Transformer achieves superior results in translation and other applications, while also being scalable and easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

Absolutely bombs my KTANE test though - poor character recognition, poor handling of even mildly complex tables, and prone to getting stuck in repetition loops.  (Task was convert to docling, in the official HF space.)That said, I'm definitely glad to see work in this area, particularly with open weights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does seem comparable to Tesseract?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you make use of it? Is it basically logarithms of values? So add them together to multiply them? I don't know if I quite understand how the units would work.As an example, "how long would it take for everyone in a large high school to microwave their meals if they all did it sequentially?".People in a large high school is *4* (let's say about 3000 people).Microwaving a meal is *2* (let's say 5 minutes).So by Napkin Math we get 4+2=*6* which is a *large metropolitan area*.Oops. I mean 11.6 days.And with normal multiplication, 3000 * 5 = 10.4 days, so 11.6 days is a pretty good estimate.So I think the answer is indeed "add the numbers together to multiply them", and be careful that you understand what units you're using.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is generally a good mental tool.Yet, without explicitly saying it's about (base-10) logarithms, it is preaching to the choir - either you already know that, or won't learn either.Pet peeve - while most numbers make sense, this not, by a quite a large number:&gt; -10 practically impossible, every atom in your body quantum tunneling simultaneously one foot to the leftI don't want to do maths here, but for a single particle to happen that, it would be a totally different scale (I don't know, maybe closer to -10^10^10).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one that doesn't make sense to me is "Days per $1000," because it's the only one (that I saw) where each line has an order of magnitude plus an addition unit, and that unit is often different from the one in the heading.    -2 hours minimum wage day's work, small coffee shop daily revenue    
    -1 days entry-level weekly salary, independent contractor daily rate    
    0 weeks average monthly rent payment, typical car payment

Is the difference in order of magnitude between the first two just one (-2 to -1) or 2 (E-2 hours vs E-1 days)?And how is "0.1 days per $1000" an entry-level weekly salary? Now we have days and weeks in the same sentence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43389455</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The document, authored by Edsger W. Dijkstra, discusses the concept of structured programming and the importance of clarity in programming languages. Dijkstra critiques the reliance on unstructured programming techniques, highlighting that they can lead to complex and error-prone code. He emphasizes the necessity for a disciplined approach to programming, advocating for the use of clear constructs like sequences, selections, and iterations, which promote maintainability and understandability in software development. The text reinforces the idea that programming should be a logical and structured process to improve both the quality of code and the efficiency of programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously, it all depends on whether u're counting the items themselves (1-based) or the spaces btwn them (0-based).
The former uses natural numbers, while the latter uses non-negative integersFor instance, when dealing with memory words, do u address the word itself or its starting location (the first byte)?The same consideration applies to coordinate systems: r u positioning urself at the center of a pixel or at the pixel's origin?Almost 2 decades ago I designed an hierarchical IDs system (similar to OIDs[1]). First I made it 0-based for each index in the path. After a while I understood that I need to be able to represent invalid/dummy IDs also, so I used -1 for that. It was ugly - so I made it 1-based, &amp; any 0 index would've made the entire ID - invalid---1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration." — Stan Kelly-Bootle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps ideally we'd change English to count the "first" entry in a sequence as the "zeroth" item, but the path dependency and the effort required to do that is rather large to say the least.At least we're not stuck with the Roman "inclusive counting" system that included one extra number in ranges* so that e.g. weeks have "8" days and Sunday is two days before Monday since Monday is itself included in the count.* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting#Inclusive_counting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43433599</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea, but not the web-based implementation. Local first, and ideally an open source app that can work offline when I'm going distraction free.It feels like a vim plugin. It definitely feels like org-mode can do this.A few years back I had a little command line tool where I could log things quickly - it was like syslog for humans - but with #hashtags for projects or clients, and then a small tool that would work out how long I'd spent on different things. It required me to write a log every time I finished a task or a pomodoro. I might resurrect that, but having an open file has been cute for me for quite a while, and then I can go back and copy/paste what I need to draft docs and so on.I do think "note taking" as an app is actually under-served. There's lots of wiki plugins, org-mode, tons of "productivity tools", but actually a single app that lets you just write, then helps you with review (and timestamps, contexts and so on are essential to that), and then figure out actions/todos and gives you seamless interaction with those, and integration with 3rd-party tools (I don't want to copy and paste between vim/emacs/JIRA/asana/notion/trello/apple notes/calendar reminders/outlook tasks/whatever), would be very, very neat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is lovely. I maintain a dev log at work where I manually time-stamp entries section wise, but many times I’m doing it after the fact. Ability to edit the time stamps and then search based on it would make this super powered.Actually, I would love to combine this with Heynote[0], have you considered it?[0]: https://heynote.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my work I often need to know when things happened, for scenarios like: 
interviews, incidents, protocol meetings, experiments, debugging, etcI noticed there was no simple way to achieve this with any note taking app, so I made one.* every line you write is automatically timestamped.* minimalist and distraction free - follows the simplicity of the built-in note apps.* cross platform - it's a webapp so no install required, works great on mobile, web, android, iOS, tablets.you can use it for free, no email and no signup required.I made this first version where data is stored locally on your device.Sharing here in case someone finds it useful, 
it would be great to know I solved the same problem for anyone else :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434152</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a case in which the FBI seized a woman's life savings without providing a clear explanation for the action. It highlights issues related to civil asset forfeiture, where law enforcement can confiscate property suspected of being involved in criminal activity without a formal charge or trial. The piece critiques the lack of transparency and accountability in such practices, emphasizing the emotional and financial repercussions for individuals whose assets are taken. The story serves as an illustration of the broader implications of these policies on citizens' rights and the justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;  About two years post-seizure, the bureau returned Martin's money—shortly after she filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit. But while the bureau may have hoped that would persuade her to drop it, she has continued with her suit, which was back in court last week and seeks a ruling that will prevent the FBI from proceeding with others as it did with her.

Hero.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures  allowed to be kept by the organisation doing the seizing is  a terrible incentive. In other countries, seizures go to general revenue, which means that the incentive to do it is diluted enormously.
This is especially a problem with small police forces, or small polities where fines become a large proportion of revenue. You'd think that for the FBI the incentive would be diluted, given how huge they are, but maybe there is some institutional incentive there.I would argue that breaking the incentive is the best way to stop this,as opposed to fighting the detail of seizure justification (although the concept of 'criminal property' without charging the owner should be limited too)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The warrant, which agents misled a judge to obtain,A huge fraction of FBI missteps that make the news involve this fact pattern but it's never actually what causes the misstep to blow up and make the news.  You don't need to know statistics to know what this implies about the prevalence of said fact pattern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43433694</guid></item><item><title>47.

Now that they have access to the hardware and not dropping support, I am not sure if it matters much.The public doesn't have access to RISC-V hardware and it won't have access anytime soon.The problem to be solved seems availability of the hardware, not support from a small Linux distribution. It's not like we can go to Hetzner and rent a RISC-V server or go to AWS and provision a RISC-V VM.And the availability will only improve if there is enough demand from the market to build such hardware. The EU and China wanting to be less dependant on US tech might help here.Of course, RISC-V hardware should be on par on perf/price with x86 and ARM to tempt someone to switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So much for the “RISC-V isn’t ready” crowd—this is exactly how niche architectures survive: stubborn devs, a loaned Milk-V box, and a middle finger to pragmatism. Honestly, dropping it now would’ve been a waste. If anything, this feels like a test run for how the indie Linux world will carry RISC-V until the big players stop waffling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Similar situations have happened in various open-source projects, Ampere used to provide ARM instance access to builders, before being acquired by Softbank, now the world need more such Ampere's than ever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43432485</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An insight that might help tie functional programming (FP) and imperative programming (IP) together is that FP is spreadsheets and IP is macros (edit: recordings of human interaction and shell scripts). Ideally all business logic should be FP and event-driven interfaces are usually IP. I think of these as clusters of similar concepts:  FP
  synchronous blocking
  immutable
  process isolation
  auto optimization
  auto parallelization
  higher-order methods
  scatter-gather, fork-join
  deterministic/repeatable (sometimes) reversable execution
  models and views in MVC
  ugly prefix/postfix syntax that doesn't look like algebra (not always)
  
  IP
  asynchronous nonblocking
  mutable
  shared state
  manual optimization
  manual parallelization
  generators/iterators
  threads, locks/mutexes
  nondeterministic promises/futures requiring snapshots to reverse execution
  controllers in MVC
  pretty infix syntax that looks like algebra (not always)

I believe that ideally we'd write everything in FP with no IP whatsoever. So no mutable variables, no pass by reference, no iteration. Just higher-order methods and copy-on-write, with static analysis simplifying intermediate code into its fastest and/or most concise representation to run in parallel as fast as possible on multicore CPUs. Each component runs single-shot using analogs of STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR. These can fully represent models and views functionally and even declaratively.Then IP would be used to wire up components, similarly to controllers in MVP. For example when a UNIX executable blocks waiting for more data on an input stream, or more room in an output stream. The runtime/filesystem/network/OS between isolated executables is imperative.FP and IP can be unified by enforcing immutability everywhere in an IP language, then transpiling the code to reshape it between prefix/infix/postfix notation. Unfortunately I/O still can't be implemented without monads, making this psuedo-FP language impure. So there may be no way to build an entirely pure FP runtime that can respond to dynamic input/output and exceptional behavior. It would be like having a spreadsheet with no connection to the outside world, where the values of cells can't be edited, so formulas could run but they never have reason to do so.Attempts can also be made to eliminate IP altogether by providing impure functionality in FP languages by introducing monads for I/O and exceptional behavior, allowing mutation by isolating it in blocks, etc. I believe that makes impure FP languages equivalent to IP, corrupting them and defeating the point of using FP. Sometimes that makes sense though if/when we can live with the tradeoffs, or if we're porting code from IP languages that's too difficult to refactor to pure FP. Unfortunately most impure FP languages are also difficult to read by humans, limiting their adoption.Without the basic understanding listed here, the world seems to naturally head towards IP, since it most closely mimicks how humans navigate the world. IP languages tend to borrow FP concepts like monads to implement async behavior like generators, futures and promises. This sacrifices determinism and expands shared state to such a degree that IP programs can only grow to a certain size before they are intractable. This can sort of be avoided with reducers like Redux or writelog databases, usually at a cost in having to maintain boilerplate.The world also tends to double down on static types, categories, templates/generics, formal contracts/interfaces, etc, borrowed from FP without a clear understanding of when or why they're necessary. When often programs can be written much more concisely and clearly by avoiding custom types altogether and focusing on data-driven standard types like numbers, strings and JSON run through transformation functions. An obvious example being how Java programs are often bloated and overengineered because they are object-oriented instead of functional. It's amazing to see how so much boilerplate often contains so little actual business logic. And how languages inspired by Java, like C#, often seem to repeat its shortcomings.I think of all of this as analogous to how beginners tend to implement a game's main loop with state machines for each sprite. Whereas in Unity they can use coroutines. Once we see how straightforward it is to write business logic in a one-shot fashion, it's hard to imagine going back to juggling the complexities of state machines. Especially since state machines and coroutines can be made equivalent via generators.Another example is that digital electronic circuits are equivalent to a spreadsheet and can be represented and analyzed by FP, but it's hard to convert an IP program description into a circuit or analyze its behavior formally using techniques from logic.Once we have these kinds of insights, it's difficult to unsee them. And to look at best practices without asking ourselves why we're doing things the hard way.As far as I know, the only language that approximates pure FP with IP glue handled by the runtime to avoid monads is ClojureScript. Admittedly, I'm probably misunderstanding how it works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43397055</guid></item><item><title>50.

I’m getting tired of seeing opinions dressed up as insight—especially when they’re this detached from how real systems actually work.I worked on the Cell processor and I can tell you it was a nightmare. It demanded an unrealistic amount of micromanagement and gave developers rope to hang themselves with. There’s a reason it didn’t survive.What amazes me more is the comment section—full of people waxing nostalgic for architectures they clearly never had to ship stable software on. They forget why we moved on. Modern systems are built with constraints like memory protection, isolation, and stability in mind. You can’t just “flatten address spaces” and ignore the consequences. That’s how you end up with security holes, random crashes, and broken multi-tasking. There's a whole generation of engineers that don't seem to realize why we architected things this way in the first place.I will take how things are today over how things used to be in a heart beat. I really believe I need to spend 2-weeks requiring students write code on an Amiga, and the programs have to run at the same time. If anyone of them crashes, they all will fail my course. A new found appreciation may flourish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issue is that programming a discrete GPU feels like programming a printer over a COM port, just with higher bandwidths. It's an entirely moronic programming model to be using in 2025.- You need to compile shader source/bytecode at runtime; you can't just "run" a program.- On NUMA/discrete, the GPU cannot just manipulate the data structures the CPU already has; gotta copy the whole thing over. And you better design an algorithm that does not require immediate synchronization between the two.- You need to synchronize data access between CPU-GPU and GPU workloads.- You need to deal with bad and confusing APIs because there is no standardization of the underlying hardware.- You need to deal with a combinatorial turd explosion of configurations. HW vendors want to protect their turd, so drivers and specs are behind fairly tight gates. OS vendors also want to protect their turd and refuse even the software API standard altogether. And then the tooling also sucks.What I would like is a CPU with a highly parallel array of "worker cores" all addressing the same memory and speaking the same goddamn language that the CPU does. But maybe that is an inherently crappy architecture for reasons that are beyond my basic hardware knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having worked for a company that made a "hundreds of small CPUs on a single chip", I can tell you now that they're all going to fail because the programming model is too weird, and nobody will write software for them.Whatever comes next will be a GPU with extra capabilities, not a totally new architecture. Probably an nVidia GPU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43440174</guid></item><item><title>1.

About 15 yeard ago, I knew a guy who exclusively bought Monster... well he had two of them, one from the guitar to the pedal board and another from the board to the amp.But it wasn't because of their alleged improved sound quality or whatever, it was because they had a lifetime warranty. Dude had bought two monster 1/4inch cables and gotten them replaced "for free" like 5 times.From what I can tell they got rid of the lifetime warranty around 2018 and have mostly transitioned to licensing their name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The complete story: https://www.bluejeanscable.com/legal/mcp/index.htm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or you could screw up so monumentally that the “case” (it was never actually brought) becomes an actual meme.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the logo, it is brilliant.Making Rust's macros easier is laudable. Purely from a user's perspective I find it especially annoying, that proc macros need their own crate, even if I understand the reasons for it.
If I read Crabtime correctly it solves that problem, which is nice.That being said Crabtime looks more like compile time eval on steroids to me than an analogon to Zig's comptime.One (maybe the) distinguishing feature between  comptime in Zig and Rust macros seems to me to be access to type information. In Zig you have it[1]
in Rust you don't and that makes a big difference. It doesn't look like we will get that in Rust anytime soon and the projects that need it (e.g. cargo semver check) use dirty tricks (parsing RustDoc from the macro) to accomplish it. I did not see anything like that in Crabtime, but I might have missed it. At any rate, I'd expect compile time reflection for anything that claims to bring comptime to Rust.[1] I think, but I am not a Zig expert, so please correct me if I am wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love these kinds of acknowledgements, as they not only show gratitude, but also give a glimpse into the collaborative, creative process:&gt; We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the following individuals for their valuable contributions to this project:&gt; timonv – For discovering and suggesting the brilliant name for this crate. Read more about it here (https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1j42fgi/comment/mg6pw...).&gt; Polanas – For their invaluable assistance with testing, design, and insightful feedback that greatly improved the project.&gt; Your support and contributions have played a vital role in making this crate better—thank you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried the library out and it worked pretty well for me.I had previously written a declarative macro to generate benchmark functions [1]. It worked, but I didn't enjoy the process of getting it working. Nor did I feel confident about making changes to it.When I rewrote it using crabtime I found the experience much better. I was mostly writing Rust code now, something I was familiar with. The code is much more readable and customisable [2]. For example, instead of having to pass in the names of the modules each time I added a new one, I simply read the files from disk at compile time.To compare the two see what the code looks like in within the braces of paste!{} in the first one and crabtime::output!{} in the second one. The main difference is that I can construct the strings using Rust code and drop them in with a simple {{ str }}. With paste!, I don't know exactly what I did, but I kept messing around until it worked.Or compare the two loops. In the first one we have `($($year:ident {$($day:ident),+ $(,)?}),+ $(,)?)` while with crabtime we have plain Rust code - `for (year, day) in years_and_days`. I find the latter more readable.Overall I'm quite pleased with crabtime. Earlier I'd avoid Rust metaprogramming as much as possible, but now I'd be open to writing a macro if the situation called for it.[1] - https://github.com/nindalf/advent/blob/13ff13/benches/benche...[2] - https://github.com/nindalf/advent/blob/b72b98/benches/benche...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43415820</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;Scallop is a programming language designed for stream processing, enabling developers to write applications that can handle continuous data flows in a straightforward and efficient manner. It combines functional programming paradigms with reactive programming concepts, allowing for the creation of responsive and scalable applications. The website provides detailed documentation, examples, and resources for developers to learn and utilize Scallop in their projects, emphasizing its capabilities in real-time data analysis and handling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, I'm currently reading the Scallop paper, so funny to see it posted here!I really love the concept. This isn't just differentiable neurosymbolic declarative probabilistic programming; Scallop has the flexibility of letting you use various (18 included) or custom provenance semirings to e.g. track "proofs" why a relational fact holds, not just assign it a probability. Sounds cool but I'm still trying to figure out the practicality.Also worth pointing out that it seems that a lot of serious engineering work has been done on Scallop. It has an interpreter and a JIT compiler down to Rust compiled and dynamically loaded as a Python module.Because a Scallop program (can be) differentiable it can be used anywhere in an end-to-end learning system, it doesn't have to take input data from a NN and produce your final outputs, as in all the examples they give (as far as I can see). For example you probably could create a hybrid transformer which runs some Scallop code in an internal layer, reading/writing to the residual stream. A simpler/more realistic example is to compute features fed into a NN e.g. an agent's policy function.The limitation of Scallop is that the programs themselves are human-coded, not learnt, although they can implement interpreters/evaluators (e.g. the example of evaluating expressions).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does Scallop scale on large knowledge bases (KBs) for doing probabilistic reasoning? I'm currently working on large KB with ~ 12M facts and trying to do probabilistic inference on it. So far I've been using [cplint](https://friguzzi.github.io/cplint/_build/html/index.html) which is based on SWI-Prolog. It works fine for toy examples, however, it doesn't finish running for the large KB - even after waiting for it for more than a week. Does know any Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) libraries that are fast and scale to large KBs? Preferably in Prolog ecosystem, but not a hard requirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ever since I learned about category theory and its relationship with symbolic reasoning I've suspected that AGI will come from elegantly combining symbolic reasoning and probabilistic reasoning. This is the first project I've seen that seems to be positioned that way. Very cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43443640</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Rob Bonta has issued a consumer alert regarding the privacy risks associated with the genetic testing company 23andMe. Customers are warned about potential data breaches and unauthorized sharing of personal genetic information, particularly after the company announced plans to increase its focus on pharmaceutical research and partnerships. Bonta emphasizes the importance of understanding the implications of sharing genetic data and urges consumers to review 23andMe’s privacy policies and terms of service carefully to protect their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

But if that's something you need, make every effort to make sure you own your own data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem, not stated, is that a bankruptcy can wipe out the obligations of a company to its customers.

It turns out you can’t get much value from it.  If you could, they would have.And no I don’t think all of that DNA data would be valuable to the likes of a large health insurer like Humana or Aetna either.The medical records you are imagining an insurer can link to genetic data are worth even less than these DNA sequences turned out to be worth.Sincerely,A former health economist who has worked both with tens of millions of inpatient discharge records, and (separately) a detailed survey which is complemented by genetic data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43447421</guid></item><item><title>6.

No SELinux/AppArmor configs.It's lightweight, auditable, and wraps Landlock v5 features (file access + TCP restrictions).Demo + usage examples in the README.Would love feedback from the HN crowd!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My biggest problem with Linux is that there are no per-process firewall settings. I think one can get around this by using AppArmor or using an user per app and assigning rules to a user.I've used Linux for over a decade now, but there are still many things I haven't learned, so maybe I'm missing something in this regard.The GitHub page says- TCP network access control (binding and connecting)and- Support for UDP and other network protocol restrictions (when supported by Linux kernel)so maybe this can be used to firewall processes in an easy way (assuming that it is easy to set up landrun)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't quite understand what --exec does.

&lt;p&gt;George Foreman, the legendary boxer and successful infomercial star, has passed away at the age of 75. Renowned for his achievements in the boxing ring, including two world heavyweight titles, Foreman later gained fame as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which became a household name in the 1990s. His contributions to sports and popular culture, along with his vibrant personality, left a lasting impact on fans worldwide. The article reflects on his life, career, and legacy, highlighting both his athletic prowess and his entrepreneurial success.&lt;/p&gt;

Prior to that, he was paid about 40% of the profits on each grill sold (earning him $4.5 million a month in payouts at its peak), yielding an estimated total of over $200 million just from the endorsement through 2011, substantially more than he earned as a boxer."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_ForemanNot sure if luck or stars just aligned.  But that is some legit naming rights. Kudos to maybe, and I mean it... one of the best at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP George Foreman.As a former combat sports fan, I find it increasingly difficult to watch. These guys (and gals) are doing enormous brain damage to themselves &amp; their opponents. Foreman seemed to have been an outlier that came out OK, but listen to the slurring &amp; garbled speech that comes from any other old fighter. I know someone who's a friend with a longtime UFC fighter- he had an anecdote about the guy putting his kids to bed and temporarily forgetting their names. Great fights are very entertaining, but ethically I really find it difficult to be a fan these days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP.  Was a big fan of Foreman growing up, even though his initial heyday was before my time.  Which is one of the reasons I'm fond of him today - he was 48 years old when he was last heavyweight boxing champ.Every time I'm feeling "too old" to do something physical, I try to remember the baddest man on the planet was older than I am now - a fact that is still crazy to achy 'old' me now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43442917</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advantages of using long options in scripts when working with command-line tools. It emphasizes that long options lead to better readability and clarity, making scripts easier for others to understand and modify. The author provides examples comparing short and long options, highlighting how long options can be more descriptive. Additionally, the post addresses potential compatibility considerations and encourages the adoption of long options in scripting practices for improved code quality and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer long options too.  However, while writing programs that need to invoke POSIX commands in a portable manner, short options are the only viable choice, as POSIX doesn't specify long options.  For instance, see the specification for diff at &lt;https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/d...&gt;, or that of any POSIX utility listed at &lt;https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/idx/utiliti...&gt;.That said, this is more of a corner case.  In most scenarios, rather than relying on POSIX utilities, there are often better alternatives, such as using library bindings instead of spawning external processes.  For example, instead of invoking grep, using something like libpcre could be a more efficient choice.For non-POSIX utilities like git, hg, rg, ag, etc., using long options makes perfect sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please DO NOT mix string interpolation and command execution, especially when a command is processed through the shell. Whatever your language, use a list-based or array-based execution API that passes arguments straight through to execv(2), execvp(2), etc, bypassing the shell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree that long options should be used. But there is one caveat to consider: portability.Sadly to this day not all BSD distributions have GNU style long options. And the ones that now do only got them fairly recently. So if you want portability you have to use short options as you weep with a bottle of vodka in hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43440184</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;FastOpenAPI is a Python library designed to simplify the creation of OpenAPI specifications for APIs. It enhances the development experience by automatically generating OpenAPI schemas from Python code, facilitating easier documentation and integration. The library supports features like dynamic endpoints, customizable settings, and efficient validation processes, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to streamline API development and ensure compliance with OpenAPI standards.&lt;/p&gt;

Specs first, generate the code from it and implement required Interfaces.One great too for that is TypeSpec[0].This also allows thinking about the API first and ensures that what's documented is what's implemented.[0] https://typespec.io&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey everyone!While working on a project that required OpenAPI docs across multiple frameworks, I got tired of maintaining separate solutions. I liked FastAPI’s clean and intuitive routing, so I built FastOpenAPI, bringing a similar approach to other Python frameworks (Flask, Sanic, Falcon, Starlette, etc).It's meant for developers who prefer FastAPI-style routing but need or want to use a different framework.The project is still evolving, and I’d love any feedback or testing from the community!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice. This was one of the main shortcomings in Falcon that pushed me to switch some projects to FastAPI. That said FastAPI had many other benefits that went far beyond API specs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43445720</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The document is a set of lecture notes on Differential Geometry, authored by Dr. David Shifrin. It covers fundamental concepts and theories in the field, such as curves, surfaces, and various geometric structures. The notes provide detailed explanations, examples, and mathematical proofs to help students understand the principles of Differential Geometry, making it a valuable resource for those studying the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

We used it when I was an undergrad in Brazil and those were some of the most fun classes I've ever had. It gives you a ton of intuition and understanding for classical (extrinsic) differential geometry, and I feel that this experience was very helpful later in learning Riemannian geometry and General Relativity. It also helped a bit when I took an intro course to computer graphics. Solid stuff!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those are (updated) notes for a course with description (taken from prof. Shifrin's homepage):&gt; This is an undergraduate introduction to curves and surfaces in R3, with prerequisites of either MATH 2270 (2500) and MATH 3000 or MATH 3510(H). The course is a study of curvature and its implications. The course begins with a study of curves, focusing on the local theory with the Frenet frame, and culminating in some global results on total curvature. We move on to the local theory of surfaces (including Gauss's amazing result that there's no way to map the earth faithfully on a piece of paper) and heading to the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, which relates total curvature of a surface to its topology (Euler characteristic). As time permits, we'll discuss either hyperbolic geometry or calculus of variations at the end of the course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took differential geometry during undergrad but had to drop out of the course as i thought i would fail the final. Great professor, but too much for my 20 year old brain. Id like to try it again in retirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43445614</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall the industry needs more review, less hype. I was shocked to find out SWE-verified [0] is all but verified.[0] benchmark used by all major vendors to "showcase" coding ability, turns out to be &lt;10% properly solved: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOc_kKKuac&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen the same "Superficial Self-Reflection" mentioned in their linked blog post[0] as well, where the conclusion doesn't naturally follow the output of the thinking tokens. I think people are fooled by this, but if you take the time to inspect the "chain of thought" tokens they often don't match the final output answer.I don't deny that performance for certain logic tasks goes up with these models but I don't fully understand what role the thinking tokens take in these cases.[0] https://oatllm.notion.site/oat-zero&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the base models already have the “reasoning” capability, as they claim, then it’s not surprising that they were able to get to SOTA using a relatively negligible amount of compute for RL fine-tuning.I love this sort of “anti-hype” research. We need more of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43445894</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;Frink is a programming language and system designed for handling quantities, units of measure, and calculations involving them in a straightforward manner. It allows users to perform complex mathematical operations while seamlessly managing unit conversions and ensuring the correctness of physical calculations. The site provides resources such as documentation, examples, and a downloadable version of the language, making it useful for anyone needing precise and context-aware computation in scientific, engineering, or mathematical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting, but I doubt anything will ever come up in my lifetime that is even close to replacing Emacs Calc for me. I still consider it to be the best scientific calculator ever written. It's crazy that many Emacs users aren't even aware that it exists. It comes with an almost ridiculously extensive manual, complete with exercises and everything:https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.htm...It's probably overkill for most people, and I'm sad that I don't get to use it as much as when I was a student, but it's still a beautiful rabbit hole to fall into. And it works in a terminal just fine. :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting project. I use command line Qalculate [1] for this (has a very similar feature set to Frink AFAICT) and Pint [2] for scripting. I feel like unit-aware calculators are hugely underused by physical engineers, it's the same idea and benefit as type safety but they're virtually unheard of, everyone just uses excel. Having guaranteed dimensional correctness is so great for the early design stage, it makes it a lot easier to explore the problem space.[1] https://qalculate.github.io/
[2] https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is 100% proprietary and the source code for this isn't available:
https://frinklang.org/faq.html#OpenSourcei'm open to non-FOSS licenses (and advocate for and use a class of them), but in this case
1. afaict, the license offers zero rights to the user
2. for me personally, i want more rights for a language than for an app, eg mongo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43440046</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of computer vision techniques to enhance the mapping and feature extraction process in OpenStreetMap, a collaborative mapping platform. It covers various methods, such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks, to automatically identify and classify features from satellite images. The piece highlights the potential for improving map accuracy and efficiency, as well as the challenges in integrating these technological advancements with community-driven mapping efforts. The author emphasizes the importance of open-source tools and collaboration to make these innovations accessible and beneficial for users globally.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi from the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Please don't add AI-detected features directly to the database.The algorithms have problems with false positives, and with mapping straight or rectangular objects as wobbly, as shown in the second-to-last screenshot.As a helper to detect missing features, this is a precious tool. But we still need human intervention to make sure the detected objects are drawn correctly.See also: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines and https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, great re swimming pools - solar detection is another one on my list to have a go at.I feel like a lot of the pushback here is an idea that OSM can grow from hand mapping; but as someone with 60k changesets over a decade... no amount of human volunteer enthusiasm is to the point that it can "solve" mapping at a global scale to the standards that make the map data overwhelmingly useful.I feel we need a scalable framework for importing and maintaining data:  ways to annotate the quality, sources, where to report bugs in the data source, and guidance to consumers. 
Ie if I want to query "businesses of type X" "mapped by humans within the last year", I can sort of do that with "check date".But who knows how many of those attributes are accurate, or if the mapper who checked only checked one aspect (name/location)? Would it be better to ingest alltheplaces opening hours to maintain this data automatically, every month?Would it be better as a data consumer if I could filter to only certain sources I trust?
Or I could use data - even if the polygons aren't perfect or similar, even with known limitations like "poi inferred by AI".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing automated mapping first-hand makes me extremely wary of it. I've travelled across South America on a motorcycle, and OSM has a large amount of edits there that look automated (particularly in Brazil), making it barely usable in certain places. I'm not even talking about rural roads but also fairly large cities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43447335</guid></item><item><title>14.

Is this RL'ed or just somehow a natural effect of the training?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;   the excellent performance demonstrated by the models fully proves the crucial role of reinforcement learning in the optimization process

What if this reinforcement is just gaming the benchmarks (Goodhart's law) without providing better answers elsewhere, how would we notice it ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After playing around with this model a bit, it seems to have a tendency to reply to English questions in Chinese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43447254</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the NixOS package manager could have detected a vulnerability in the XZ compression tool. It explains the concept of vulnerability detection within software environments and highlights how NixOS's unique package management and configuration system can enhance security by allowing for more transparent tracking of dependencies and reproducibility of builds. The author emphasizes the benefits of using declarative package management to identify and address security issues effectively, proposing that such an approach can lead to a more secure software ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that NixOS and reproducible builds did not detect the xz backdoor, and in fact NixOS shipped the malicious builds of xz (though they didn't do anything because the malware didn't target NixOS):&gt; I am a NixOS developer and I was surprised when the backdoor was revealed to see that the malicious version of xz had ended up being distributed to our users.As always theory and reality are different, and the thing that made xz possible was never a technical vulnerability with a technical solution—xz was possible because of a meatspace exploit. We as a community are very very bad at recognizing that you can't always just patch meatspace with better software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel the author is a bit tunnel visioned by what happens to happen this time. The Jiatan incident has a sample size of one, it'd be a bit short sighted to think that's the only way it could happen. You can imagine various scenarios where the defenses suggested here will not have worked.Also I (as a nix user myself) think it's unlikely NixOS would have caught it. As evidenced by the fact that it didn't. (Yeah I realize I just said next time it might happen differently but it'd be foolish to put faith in nix without evidence).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NixOS is really irrelevant here because the xz backdoor specifically targeted RedHat and Debian. It's equally relevant to say the xz backdoor didn't affect Windows (ironically the backdoor was ultimately found by a Microsoft employee, an oft-overlooked detail).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43448075</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of the polar vortex, explaining how it is affected by climate change and recent weather patterns. It highlights the impact of warming Arctic temperatures on the stability of the polar vortex, which can lead to extreme weather events in mid-latitude regions. The piece emphasizes the connection between shifts in the polar vortex and severe winter weather, including frigid temperatures and storms, and discusses the implications for weather forecasting and climate science. Overall, it underscores the importance of understanding the polar vortex in the context of a changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;

Could someone explain what they mean with "warmer part of the year" if not air temperature? Increased warming through more sunlight?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting article. We are past the usual -20 or lower six weeks where I am so feels like a typical year. If I choose a random northern place like Rankin Inlet NU it is still cold up there with a low of -33 tonight.It is a sign of the times when I think huh, climate.gov… is that a reputable source?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;from March 6th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43448023</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses what to do if a user accidentally deletes a library (lib) on a Linux system while being connected via SSH. It explains the potential issues that can arise, such as losing access to commands if crucial libraries are removed. The author provides a step-by-step guide on how to recover from the mistake, including checking for the deleted library, reinstalling it using package managers, and other recovery methods to restore system functionality. The article serves as a helpful resource for users who may encounter similar issues while managing Linux remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One time I was flipping back and forth between directories, compiling some code, then checking it, then rm -rf'ing it. I accidentally hit up an cd ..'d one too many times. Suddenly the rm command hung and I was confused because it should be nearly instant as it was a few files. I stared in horror as I was accidentally deleting everything in mybhome directory. Luckily back then I had a .pr0n directory with a significant amount of content. A few things were lost but that .pr0n folder was luckily early enough in the list and big enough to slow down the deletion of my photos and documents. That's why I always recommend having a big "buffer" of video content for such situations, ya know, for data integrity ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something similar happened a place I worked somewhere between 10 and 20 years ago.Service technician did not see the . in the command  rm -rf ./bin

so he proceeded to run  rm -rf /bin 

When that didn't work he did what everyone who knows a little bit Linux does and added sudo in front.I was on a terminal from the other side of the globe when the server suddenly started acting weird.We were able to use scp or rsync (one of then was in sbin or something) to get back the bits from an identical server, which saved me from three days of tedious work :-)In hindsight of course we should have written the docs in a way that would prevent this exact situation but in the beginning it was just the output of the history command after I had done it, dumped into a document with some explanations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I now know why on macOS "Applications" (with capital A) comes first in the list of root-level directories. I've been showing to my colleague that on modern systems "sudo rm -rf /" does nothing, however that turned out to be GNU-specific thing, and macOS of course uses BSD tools. So I've started noticing that something is off very quickly and stopped the command. On HFS+ (probably on APFS too) the file list is always sorted, so it only deleted some of my Adobe apps and stuff like Addressbook, so I didn't even notice anything at first :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43444160</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured stunning images of vibrant auroras in Jupiter's atmosphere, showcasing the planet's dynamic weather and magnetic field interactions. These auroras, occurring near the planet's poles, are generated by charged particles from the solar wind colliding with Jupiter's atmosphere, similar to the northern and southern lights on Earth. The observations reveal intricate patterns and colors and contribute to understanding Jupiter's atmospheric phenomena and space weather impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

And in the other photo (middle in the galley) it looks like a little bit of the earth is eclipsing the second sun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am curious what causes these landers to fail in the bitter cold of night?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mathematical Methods for Physics is such a great course. Took the course, and an Advanced version in undergraduate when I was still attempting to be a physicist. The course is at its core a bunch of very important Mathematical concepts that a Physicist or adjacent will need that you won't quite ever come across naturally in mathematics courses unless you go into graduate studies. A "Here is the problem, here is the math and here is why" is just very useful. Legendre Polynomials, Bessel Functions, Lagrangian, Fourier Functions. Just tons of interesting and really useful math that when you hit a problem in their space you have a super power.My professor for the courses always said it was about putting more mathematical tools in your tool box. Which is a perspective I've since carried.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading the numerous lecture notes on mathematical methods used in physics that are available online is like reading stories about love: it never gets old, and each time you learn something new!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ronald L.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Rodriques: Many people assume we’re focused on wet lab automation. There are certainly opportunities there and we are exploring them, but the biggest opportunities are actually on the cognitive side.Wet lab automation is very difficult and capital intensive. And once you build your lab you are constraining yourself to answering questions within a certain domain for which you have the relevant sample prep and characterization equipment. Your equipment in essence defines your design space, and thus your potential solution space, which places a bound on your TAM.So of course automating the thinking part of science is more approachable with current AI - but is that what people want? It’s certainly an attractive proposition for management: automate away the highly-paid SMEs and turn R&amp;D into more of a factory environment with replaceable lab techs.. but actually implementing this depends on where the power lies in an org. My theory is that in many orgs the “cognitive” folks hold the true power (= the unwritten expertise about what works and what doesn’t, when to work around your existing setup, how much to trust each number an instrument produces). They’ll resist this change to their last breath.You may gain some short-term efficiency by accelerating the experiments of today, but in the long run you lose the expertise to break out of local minima imposed by your equipment and training data.Or to think about this another way, imagine a PhD student who was never allowed to talk to other people, attend conferences etc., and could only read papers and try things in lab. But they can read papers extremely fast. Would they be successful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m optimistic that an AI scientist will help with reproducibility overall. Did you do the experiment that you said you did? Did you record all the variables in a way that you can report it in the way you did it?Interesting to think of the potential long term impact for science. Reminds me of the reform in the early 20th century that focused on ensuring the contents of canned goods matched their labeled ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are massive opportunities for accelerating science through AI-human collaboration. However, it requires new management and a new set of standards. If AI can write a paper that was good for publication a year ago, what does that mean for science?It’s really unclear.Im particularly interested in AI assisted education research. I think we need to keep an eye on empirical methods for developing smarter humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43418960</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of understanding and embracing type systems in programming, emphasizing that they are not a hindrance but a valuable tool for improving code quality. It explains how types help prevent errors, enhance code readability, and facilitate collaboration among developers. The author encourages programmers to view types as allies, supporting their development process and promoting better software design rather than as obstacles to creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43403321"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People might be afraid of types because in OOP land there's the idea that types aren't mere containers for data.You have to use encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Fields and properties shouldn't have public setters. You assign a value only through a method, otherwise you make the gods angry.You have gazillions of constructors, static, public, protected, private and internal. And you have gazillions of methods, static, public, private, protected and internal.You inherit at least an abstract class and an interface.You have at least some other types composed in your type.Unless you do all this, some people might not consider them proper types.I had my engineering manager warn me that data classes are "anemic models". Yes, but why? "We should have logic and methods to set fields in classes". "Yes, but why?" "It's OOP and we do DDD and use encapsulation." "Yes, but why? Imagine we have immutable records that hold just data and static classes as function containers, and those functions just act on the records, return some new ones and change no state. This way we can reason with ease about our goddam software, especially if we don't encapsulate state and mutate it all over the place, Uncle Bob, be damned." He shook his head in horror. He probably thinks I am a kind of heretic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issue is names.Every darn little thing in Java needs a name.If there is no good name, that's a hint that maybe you don't need a new type.Obligatory Clojure example:    (defn full-name [{:keys [first-name last-name]}] 
          (str first-name " " last-name))

This defines a function named `full-name`.
The stuff between [] is the argument list. There's a single argument. The argument has no name.
Instead it is using destructuring to access keys `:first-name` and `:last-name` of a map passed in (so the type of the unnamed argument is just Map)This function works for anything that has a key `:first-name` and `:last-name`.There's no need to declare a type ObjectWithFirstNameAndLastName. It would be quite silly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of disagree with this article, when you add a "noun" (aka type), you're often introducing a new abstraction.Abstractions have a maintenance cost associated with it ie, another developer or possibly yourself must be able to recreate the "algebra" associated with that type (your thought process) at the time of making modifications. This creates some problems:1. Since there's no requirement to create a cohesive algebra (API), there was probably never a cohesive abstraction to begin with.2. Requirements may have changed since the inception of the abstraction, further breaking its cohesion.3. Since we largely practice "PR (aka change) driven development", after a few substantial repetitions of step 2, now the abstraction has morphed into something that's actually very tied into the callsites (verbs), and is essentially now tech debt (more like a bespoke rube goldberg machine than a well-designed re-usable software component).You can introduce types if you follow the open/closed principle which means you don't change abstractions after their creation (instead create new ones and then delete old ones when they have no callsites).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43403321</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;An Italian court has mandated that Google block access to certain IPTV pirate websites at the DNS level. This ruling reflects ongoing efforts to combat copyright infringement and piracy in Italy, emphasizing the responsibility of tech companies to assist in preventing access to illegal content. The decision raises discussions about the implications for digital rights and content access, as well as the role of search engines and DNS providers in enforcing such legal actions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This decision follows a similar case against Internet backbone firm Cloudflare. In January, the Court of Milan found that Cloudflare's CDN, DNS server, and WARP VPN were facilitating piracy. The court threatened Cloudflare with fines of up to 10,000 euros per day if it did not begin blocking the sites.I'm always curious about jurisdiction on this stuff.If Cloudflare had no physical machines, employees, and property within Italy's borders, under what law could Italy levy a fine?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I correct in recognizing this as a new low, or is there a prior example for such a demand?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The goal is aimed at preventing illegal football streamsIt's impressive how much internet censorship in Europe is currently being caused by this one group of extremely greedy people. It's one of the rare cases where the sheer size and international influence of companies like Google and Cloudflare can actually do some good for the world by fighting back against such laws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43448112</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Magical Instant Bullets" explores the concept of instantaneous ammunition delivery in military contexts, discussing various scenarios where technology could enable rapid replenishment of bullets on the battlefield. It examines the implications of such advancements for combat strategies, logistics, and the potential effects on soldier performance and safety. The piece emphasizes the transformative impact of technology on warfare and speculates on future developments in military capabilities related to ammunition supply.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Compared to the rest of the exotic UT arsenal, these seem unremarkable, boring even. They don’t fire bright bolts of plasma or glowing, exploding goo.There is also the lightning gun. I recall using this on newer variants of facing worlds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do bullets actually fall at exactly the same speed if dropped or fired horizontally? In a vacuum, obviously they do. But my intuition says there would be some impact on the vertical air resistance from travelling 500m/s in the horizontal direction. As the bullet pushes through the air, the air pressure above and below it is increased (you can actually see that in the photo in the post). So wouldn't it effectively be falling through denser air than in the dropped case? Also, of course, it would be falling in a horizontal orientation, whereas the dropped bullet would probably realign itself to vertical.Anyway, none of that invalidates the broader point, and the effects would be comparatively tiny even if present. Just found it interesting to consider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really fun piece.&gt; No computer game will ever have the level of sophistication to model shockwaves, fluid dynamic effects, spin9, the Coriolis effect, and the Magnus effect.I'm no superfan, but who can forget the CoD4 "escape from Chernobyl/Prypyat" sniper sequence?https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/One_Shot,_One_Kill/Transc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43429427</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of centralizing authorization within software systems to enhance security, simplify management, and improve compliance. It highlights the challenges associated with decentralized authorization systems, such as complexity and potential security vulnerabilities, and argues that a centralized approach can provide a more streamlined, consistent, and secure way to manage access controls. The piece advocates for adopting modern authorization frameworks and tools that facilitate centralized control, which ultimately leads to more efficient user management and improved organizational security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when we implemented AAA (Authentication, authorization, and accounting) at Amazon, which enforces a central authority and secondary encryption on all inter-service communications. What was great about it was there was several services that simply refused to integrate and we had to let them have unfettered access to other services. To cover up this issue, we simply ignored it. Hasn't been a problem yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dig it, and I suspect this might be a big part of my next role given that I’ve always been the “Active Directory/AAD/Entra/IAM/Okta” guy. I like my directories lean, clean, tightly integrated, highly available, and with as few “branches” from the centralized authorization pipeline as possible - so all of this seems to hit my core strengths.Guess I’ve got some weekend research ahead of me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i came to a stark realisation after abandoning youtube premium that i may one day be banned for adblockingdue to nearly all of my authentication being done through google i would lose nearly all my digital content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43399127</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of "Fallout 2" and "Baldur's Gate," two pivotal titles in the CRPG (computer role-playing game) renaissance of the late 1990s. It explores how "Fallout 2" expanded on its predecessor by offering deeper storytelling and player choice, while "Baldur's Gate" revitalized the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing experience with its intricate character development and strategic combat. The piece highlights the impact these games had on the genre, emphasizing their innovations in gameplay mechanics, narrative depth, and player agency that influenced future titles and helped establish a lasting legacy in the gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fallout 3 is the best example of uncanny valley phenomenon.In original Fallout you enter a city which spans across four screens, repetetively uses the same set of limited sprites and is inhabited by some random moving pixels acting as citizens of which several have some interesting dialog lines.The Fallout 3 seems similar at first, only employing a major leap in technological advancement - the city spans in every direction, there are animated and voice acted characters, and everyone is presented in cutting edge 3D technology.But it all falls flat upon closer inspection. Every building is exactly the same. Dialogs are mundane and everyone has some sort of hiking accident where they took an arrow to the knee and even though the city has only 8 buildings its easy to get lost.The reason is simple - in the original the story takes place mainly in your head, it's a mind's eye theatre, the game only gives you a broad outlines of the world and you are forced to fill out the blanks yourself. The game doesn't try to be realistic and leaves you a lot of space.Once you start animating and voice acting your characters you quickly realize it's an endless money pit. The more lines you add, the cost grows exponentially, because you have to account for all localisation scenarios.This is summed up very well (forgive me for not looking up reference and quoting from memory) by Bioshock lead who said in interview:"At work if I have an idea we need to assemble a team - including programmers, modellers, scripters - and just to get a basic prototype that would give us the gist of what we were thinking it takes a month or more. Meanwhile, at home, I can relax after work, and in one evening session create a whole Doom campaign."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very negative depiction of Fallout 2 here. I would instead strongly recommend it, especially to players who liked the first Fallout, or who liked Fallout New Vegas. It does not feel as heartless and disjointed as the article suggests, instead it is a bigger game than its predecessor with more variety and options. Lots of roleplaying and great lore with good quests and interesting characters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved both of these games and spent a lot of time with them. The Baldur's Gate review here stays pretty close to others I've read, but the Fallout 2 review is the more interesting part because it's more opinionated, and in ways I disagree with. It's interesting how much everyone involved seemed to dislike the game, but very much fits the late 90's vibe. It's also what made it one of my all-time favorites. I never felt like I was playing through someone else's story. It felt like a set of content you could actually create your own character and play through, directed by your character's own motivations rather than the writer's. It's a quality that's rare to find in games, but the conditions of a bunch of people creating as much content as they could without a specific direction make sense for how this kind of thing would have to come together. Baldur's Gate is great, but much more linear and gives less opportunities for choices and role-playing. I wish more games would revisit the freedom of Fallout 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43442694</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and experiences of using online dating apps, specifically focusing on OkCupid. It highlights issues such as algorithmic biases and the pressure of choice that can lead to frustration and a lack of meaningful connections. It also examines the implications of data privacy and the impact of these platforms on users' mental health. Ultimately, the author advocates for more thoughtful and intentional approaches to dating in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

Walmart (I just forwarded the email to legal@ and they took care of that instance very quickly, kudos to that at least).  Edit: Forgot to add TD Bank - I actually opened a case with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that regulates this bank.Companies that spammed me in the last 24 hours because they don't validate emails addresses they add to their mailing lists (maybe there are accounts too, IDK):NerdWallet, 
Ace Hardware, 
Take 5 Oil Change, 
Boot Barn, 
Tommy Hilfiger, 
The University of Scanton, 
Tractor Supply Company, 
Kutztown University, and a few small businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ugh. Then there's the general stupidity of forcing people to use E-mail addresses as user IDs. It's not just annoying, but also a security blunder. The general public can't be counted on to understand that when they're forced to use their E-mail address as an ID, they don't have to use their E-mail account's password for it.That makes every one of these sites a gatekeeper to the user's E-mail account. All it takes is one shitty security regime or one disgruntled employee to expose these credentials.Then there's the fact that everyone's E-mail addresses are on thousands of spammers' lists. When you combine those lists with lists of common passwords and start probing accounts, you have... once again... boatloads of compromised ones.It's sad to see a company like Apple fall into this dumb behavior and then try to patch it up after some high-profile "hacks." Originally, Apple IDs did not have to be E-mail addresses; when they implemented this dumb policy, they wound up with scads of customers with multiple Apple IDs and purchases scattered across them willy-nilly. And when people rightfully complained, Apple huffily declared that it would NOT consolidate them for anyone. Nice attitude: Create a problem and then refuse to provide a solution.But back to the perpetrator here: OKCupid took this to a new level when they started insisting that you provide a phone number. I got into some loop where I couldn't log in and I couldn't log out, because they kept hounding me about the phone number that I couldn't access my account settings to provide. Or something stupid like that. And you know what, OKC? You don't need my phone number, so piss off.It's too bad. OKCupid was the best of the dating sites during its heyday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When I tried to unsubscribe using the one-click unsubscribe button in one of the emails, I was met with an error: “Something went wrong, please try again later.”I want to start a blog which is just shaming every company whose most basic functions don't work and there's no recourse. It happens at least twice a day to me. Like a financial services management company whose website can't load my financial information. Or a jobs site that offers me premium subscription but its payments page is broken and I can't even notify them because there's no contact method. Or half the unsubscribes on the internet that never work, or require me to login to unsubscribe but it won't let me log in.Does anyone work at Google? Why is it that, on my Samsung Android phone, when I pull up Google Search in the browser and click the search bar, if I don't wait at least 30 seconds, anything I type into the text bar not only is severely lagged, but then the letters appear in random jumbled order like the cursor is jumping? But if I wait it works fine?? Don't they make billions of dollars? Isn't this their whole product?

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "krita_export_region" provides a plugin for Krita that allows users to export selected regions of their artwork as images. The plugin enhances the workflow for artists by enabling them to export only specific areas rather than the entire canvas, facilitating the creation of asset libraries or sharing parts of their work. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and details on contributing to the project, making it a valuable resource for Krita users looking to streamline their export process.&lt;/p&gt;

It has command-line flags to export a PNG rendered only from the part of a SVG that is within the bounds of a specified object. I often create a hidden layer to hold rectangles marking areas I will want to export frequently and then write a script/Makefile to run the export command for each rectangle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Please fork for changesI like this direct and sensible approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very helpful for making videogame assets and exporting them in parts to Godot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43426105</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the sentencing of the CEO of an AI advertising technology company who publicly promised to eradicate fraud in the industry but was found guilty of committing fraud himself. The case highlights the irony of an executive in the anti-fraud sector engaging in deceptive practices, raising questions about accountability and ethics in the tech industry. The CEO received a prison sentence and a financial penalty, serving as a cautionary tale regarding the disparity between corporate claims and actual practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various concepts related to resource management and coordination in systems, particularly focusing on locks, leases, fencing, and tokens as mechanisms for ensuring consistency and safe access to shared resources. It explores how these concepts are applied in computing and technology contexts, highlighting their advantages and potential drawbacks. The piece also touches on the emerging practice of “fizzbee,” which integrates these mechanisms to enhance efficiency and security in complex systems. Overall, it aims to provide insights into the trade-offs and considerations when managing resources in a complex environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can fix this scenario by incrementing the next_token when you commit the critical section instead of when you enter (if that's possible for your domain). This essentially makes it an optimistic lock instead of a pessimistic lock. Two threads can get the same fence token, but only one will be able to commit.You can often rephrase and algorithm without a commit step into one that has one, although sometimes it can feel more complicated. E.g. instead of doing A and B in a critical section, commit an intent to do A and B, and then let an idempotent process execute that intent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone explain to me how it makes sense that you want to define a locking mechanism using.. locking mechanism (the "atomic"). Does this mean that in an actual implementation you would have to drop down to some hardware-level-atomic operation, and is that even practical?Also won't fencing token require some kind of token manager, that ensures you must present the highest token to do the action, and that you have to ask to get a new token, and that when you fail because your token is too old you must re-request one, is this modelled?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The creator of FizzBee presented it at the most recent meeting of the SF Systems Club. The talk was some kind of meandering hybrid between presentation and tutorial and went far over time, but FizzBee itself sounds rich in features and simple to use. Its creator is pitching it as an easy-to-use verification tool for software teams in industry to document and verify the systems they're building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43405638</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a security vulnerability identified in Next.js, designated as CVE-2025-29927. It outlines the nature of the vulnerability, how it can potentially impact applications using Next.js, and emphasizes the importance of updating to the latest version of the framework to mitigate the risk. The developers provide guidance on the patching process and encourage developers to stay informed about security practices to protect their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found a different article that goes into more detail:https://zeropath.com/blog/nextjs-middleware-cve-2025-29927-a...This looks trivially easy to bypass.More generally, the entire concept of using middleware which communicates using the same mechanism that is also used for untrusted user input seems pretty wild to me. It divorces the place you need to write code for user request validation (as soon as the user request arrives) from the middleware itself.Allowing ANY headers from the user except a whitelisted subset also seems like an accident waiting to happen. I think the mindset of ignoring unknown/invalid parts of a request as long as some of it is valid also plays a role.The framework providing crutches for bad server design is also a consequence of this mindset - are there any concrete use cases where the flow for processing a request should not be a DAG? Allowing recursive requests across authentication boundaries seems like a problem waiting to happen as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;next.js has a history of similar vulnerabilities.I was made aware recently of a vulnerability that was fixed by this patch: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/73482/filesIn this vulnerability, adding a 'x-middleware-rewrite: https://www.example.com' header would cause the server to respond with the contents of example.com. i.e. the worlds dumbest SSRF.Note that there is no CVE for this vulnerability, nor is there any clear information about which versions are affected.Also note that according to the published support policy for nextjs only "stable" (15.2.x) and "canary" (15.3.x) receive patches. But for the vulnerability reported here they are releasing patches for 14.x and 13.x apparently?https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/r...IMO you are playing with fire using nextjs for anything where you care about security and maintenance. Which seems insane for a project with 130k+ Github stars and supported by a major company like vercel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a wild vuln in how trivial it is to execute. But maybe even wilder is the timeframe to event _start_ triaging the bug after it was reported. How? Was it incorrectly named? Was the severity not correctly stated?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential impact of artificial intelligence on various industries, emphasizing that the greatest value from AI will likely come from broad automation rather than solely from research and development efforts. It argues that while R&amp;D is essential for advancing AI technology, the real transformative benefits will arise when AI is applied to automate routine tasks and processes on a large scale. The piece highlights examples of industries already experiencing significant changes due to automation and encourages organizations to focus on leveraging AI to improve efficiency and productivity across their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the gap between the idealized notion of "vibe coding"—a creative and intuitive approach to software development—and the often challenging realities developers face in practice. It emphasizes the importance of balancing creativity with structure, the need for effective communication within teams, and the challenges of navigating technical issues and deadlines. The author shares personal experiences and insights to illustrate how developers can navigate these complexities while fostering an enjoyable coding environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the bigger "AI hype vs. Reality" gap is about the productivity numbers people casually throw around, like "10x as productive" or even 100x.For example, here are YC partners quoting a company in a batch claiming "100x speedup" in coding performance compared to the previous month:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IACHfKmZMr8&amp;t=1837sYou can tell this claim is false, because that level of productivity increase would be glaringly obvious to an outside observer; it wouldn't need to be self-reported.A YC summer batch is 84 days culminating in Demo Day. So a 100x speed improvement would be like a team spending less than 1 day of coding and ending up with something that's on par with Demo Day in terms of functionality. Maybe the design would be wrong, but that wrong design would be just as fully-featured as a Demo Day app.So if 100x were true, the partners in that video would be talking about how the new batch dynamic is "They get breakfast with a customer, learn something new, have an epiphany, and then later the same day they have their entire app rewritten based on what they learned, and that scratch-rewrite is already at a Demo Day level of functionality." The partners aren't talking about that dynamic because it's not happening. So clearly the self-reported 100x is inaccurate.Even 10x would result in partners saying "Whoa, in this batch people have a Demo Day-quality app in production by the end of week 1 instead of week 12." The partners have a huge sample size on how much teams get done in what time period, so it would be glaringly obvious to them if this batch were shipping 10x as fast as previous batches.That external observation would be the headline if it were what the partners were actually seeing. Since that's not the headline, it's clearly not what they're seeing, so 10x can't be the number either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point in time, we're following the time corporate got on the outsourcing craze step for step. It had all the hype, hands off, cheaper for the same work, faster to market, every other argument you've all certainly heard. Then the reality hit. The whole discussion around LLM coding agents feels indistinguishable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the go community saying a computer will never best human go players.We already have examples of a model finding more performant sorts [0], given the right incentives and time, and the right system for optimizing (LLMs trained on “average code” probably aren’t it) the computer will best us at creating things for the computer.Is “vibe coding” real today? Not in my experience, with even Claude code. My hand has to be firmly on the tiller, using my experience and skill to correct its mistakes and guide it. But I can see the current trajectory of improvement, and I’m sure it’ll get there.[0] https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphadev-discovers-fas...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43448432</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of building a new three-tier application architecture, which separates an application into three distinct layers: presentation, application logic, and data management. It emphasizes the benefits of this architecture, such as improved organization, scalability, and maintainability. The author also outlines practical steps for implementing this architecture, including choosing the right technologies, defining the responsibilities of each tier, and ensuring clear communication between layers. The piece ultimately advocates for adopting the three-tier model to enhance application development efficiency and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think people in this industry make using complicated, powerful paradigms part of their identity. They don’t feel like they’re important unless they’re reaching for N-tier architecture or exotic databases or lambdas or whatever else it is.Most apps I’ve worked on could have been a monolith on postgres but they never ever are as soon as I’m not the sole engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took me a bit to realize the author is selling me something. I guess good job there sir.I’ve built a bunch of distributed architectures. In every case I did, we would have been better served with a monolith architecture and a single relational DB like Postgres. In fact I’ve only worked on one system that had the kind of scale that would justify the additional complexity of a distributed architecture. Ironically that system was a monolith with Postgres.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orchestration tier. Oy.So something goes wrong, and you need to back out an update to one of your microservices. But that back-out attempt goes wrong. Or happens after real-world actions have been based on that update you need to back out. Or the problem that caused a backout was transient, everything turns out to be fine, but now your backout is making its way across the microservices. Backout the backout? What if that goes wrong? The "or"s never end.Just use a centralized relational database, use transactions, and be done with it. People not understanding what can go wrong, and how RDB transactions can deal with a vast subset of those problems -- that's like the 21st century version of how to safely use memory in C.Yes, of course, centralized RDBs with transactions are sometimes the wrong answer, due to scale, or genuinely non-atomic update requirements, or transactions spanning multiple existing systems. But I have the sense that they are often rejected for nonsensical reasons, or not even considered at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43398967</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The IETF AIPREF Working Group blog discusses the group's efforts to define and refine the concept of an "Application Identifier" (AIPREF) in the context of network protocols. It aims to improve interoperability and facilitate better application communication by standardizing how applications identify themselves and interact over the internet.

But the argument is that safety agencies are unconstitutional?For me, this suggests a high level of dysfunction in the Government if people asking for things from the Government do so using the biases of the people in power as the basis for their argument rather than reasoning to it by some set of principles. I don't know how much of this article was inferred by the person writing it and how much accurately reflects Amazon's position, so I can't draw strong conclusions from it but it's an interesting reflection on the extreme 'buyer beware' attitude of cut throat businesses that take no responsibility for the harms they inflict on their own customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A serious body, doing serious work, but with a frequently hilarious social media accounthttps://bsky.app/profile/cpsc.gov&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The company argues that it merely ships these goods for others — similar to UPS and FedEx — and should not be required to cooperate with the CPSC on recalls if those products are found to be unsafe.So these other companies only pay Amazon for the shipping and nothing else, do they?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43446103</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, I wonder how much of the value of team+AI is the sense of constant momentum and progress. In my experience the utility of vibecoding is overrated BUT the utility of having a constant, enthusiastic, broadly-knowledgable assistant is underrated. I've been moving a lot faster with the help of AI but it's almost entirely acting as a "super rubber duck" that helps me explore ideas or overcome roadblocks simply by being there and mildly helpful. This compounds when working on a team; because I'm making progress, other people are excited and try to make progress, which makes me excited, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I'm very much missing so far is research into longer term consequences for learning. I get that we could potentially gain something from using AI, I would like to know what we're losing, because it's obvious to me that it's a trade of some sort.This article hints on it in the form of reduced frustration. Frustration and tearing your hair out seem to be tightly linked to learning from my experience. To the point where I wonder if it's possible to even get the same results without the experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their primary measures of group and individual performance are ratings of "quality", "novelty", etc. by technical and business experts on a ten point scale.So people working with LLM bots can improve ratings of their producy R&amp;D work product by professional peers. That's an interesting finding.Of course professionals can be wrong in their assessment of how  market actors will value their peers' work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43445381</guid></item><item><title>44.

Instead of a sedentary lifestyle I'd have an overly-active lifestyle.There have been a number of single hand chorded keyboards for niche use cases, or wrist-attached keyboard designs that never went anywhere, etc.  It never feels like it should be that hard, keyboards are just a fairly small collection of discrete inputs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aw, if I had known about this contest, I would have submitted Keyyyyyyyys!https://www.stavros.io/posts/keyyyyyyyys/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43423705</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a few really nice and freely available ML resources out there. But in order to truly get somewhere, I believe there's no way around accompanying theory with hands-on, practical exercises.Some textbooks actually do have exercises included, but for self-studying you're sort of at a loss if you face an exercise that you cannot solve on your own. If you're lucky, you can ask a question online on platforms such as stackexchange and keep your fingers crossed that you get a good answer, but this form of interaction is severly inferior to a true face-to-face tutor-student exchange where you can quickly and easily ask follow-up questions or gets hints that lead you to the right answer, rather than actually getting the correct answer presented to you.Further, in a field like ML, that really combines deep theory with practical implementations, you should really be able to do both theoretical exercises as well as hand-on programming tasks. Again, there's a lot of material out there on the internet, but it's not straight-forward to self-study, especially as a complete beginner. You'll inevitable end up in a situation where it's left to you to wade through various online tutorials on how to use a certain library or how to deal with various error messages. And in a way, that is part of our business in general; however for studying ML (or any other field), this is a distraction from your actual goal. The more time and energy you end up spending on various detours as a means to an end to get your exercises done, the more likely you are to give up.Many approaches have been offered to educate yourself online, both through the availability of resources like this Concise Machine Learning book, to lecture recordings on youtube or university website, all the way up to proper online universities and classes by Coursera and the likes. I think, however, there is still an opportunity for a true self-studying platform that intelligently integrates programming exercises in a scalable way with a focus on helping you through whenever you get stuck. That latter part especially is IMO still underdeveloped.GPTs could have a great potential to close this gap, but one thing I don't love of the status-quo is that this space is mostly covered by commercial entities. There isn't as much of a community effort in educational AI apps, and one big factor is the cost of running AIs. In classical open-source territory, one big appeal has been that you can develop software without spending much money at all - basically, all you need is a decent computer to get going. Publishing your library or app is taken care of thanks to Github et al., building a community is a lot more effort but still essentially free (except for your time investment, a cost which shouldn't be neglected). But building on GPTs costs actual money which puts many open-source enthusiasts into a more difficult situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43444017</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article is a book review of Graydon Carter's memoir, "When the Going Was Good," which reflects on his experiences in the 1970s and 1980s within the realms of journalism and New York's social scene. The review discusses Carter's interactions with high-profile figures, his career at Vanity Fair, and his observations on culture and celebrity during that era. It highlights his storytelling style and the nostalgic yet critical lens through which he views his past experiences, ultimately capturing the essence of a time marked by both glamour and excess.&lt;/p&gt;

The result was Air Mail, an e-mail publication he created with the journalist Alessandra Stanley which launched in 2019. E-mail, at that point, seemed retrograde and uncool—Substack was still in its youth—but, like many of Carter’s circumspect ideas, the plan had a surprising canniness. An e-mail publication was invulnerable to the caprices of social-media platforms and their algorithms. And, at last tally, Air Mail had in excess of four hundred thousand paid subscribers, which is more (but who now is counting?) than Harper’s or Fast Company.(https://airmail.news)  400,000 paying subscribers?!  It's apparently $40/year so that's $16 million in ARR, which must surely surpass many well-known magazines, and is frankly an incredible sum for an email newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43419616</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard disagree. The best language for AI is one that has strong compiler soundness (ie type system) that can reject incorrectness and provide feedback as to correctness to refactors. One can substitute with property based tests but it won’t be as good as soundness + pbt. Speaking from experience here… https://ghuntley.com/oh-fuck &amp;&amp; https://ghuntley.com/stdlibI do however agree that there’s langs that are not as suitable for LLMs (Java) due to their verbosity (and engineers sort classes onto filesystem like a filing drawer. LLMs work best when everything for a domain, including tests, is in a single file).Increased verbosity of the grammar does yield token wastage/ineffectiveness.Having said all that - compile time matters HEAPS. The faster you can optimise your compile time the more loops (throwing pancakes at the wall) you can do. Here’s where it gets crazy though, one can loop a verbose compilation w/metrics back into the LLM and ask the LLM to propose improvements on how to make the compile faster. It works…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By this logic, the future of AI is golf languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would working with AI need Rails?I would prefer to bet on Mojo[0].&gt; The Mojo programming language was created by Modular Inc, which was founded by Chris Lattner, the original architect of the Swift programming language and LLVM, and Tim Davis, a former Google employee. Intention behind Mojo is to bridge the gap between Python’s ease of use and the fast performance required for cutting-edge AI applications.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(programming_language)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43443974</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Facebook's new feature that allows users to opt out of the collection of personal data for targeted advertising. This move follows increasing privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny. The feature is part of an initiative to give users more control over their data and enhance transparency regarding how their information is used. However, the article also highlights the challenges Facebook faces in balancing user privacy with its advertising revenue model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intersection of recommendation systems and large language models (LLMs), exploring how these technologies can be integrated to enhance user experience. It outlines the strengths of both approaches: LLMs' ability to process natural language and generate personalized content, alongside traditional recommendation systems' proficiency in analyzing user behavior and preferences. The author emphasizes the potential benefits of combining these methodologies to create more effective and intuitive systems for content discovery, providing examples and discussing challenges in implementation. Overall, the piece advocates for innovative approaches that leverage the power of LLMs within recommendation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

Like, it was written in a way that makes the author appear very intelligent without necessarily effectively conveying information to the audience. This is something that I've often seen authors do in academic papers, and my one published research paper (not first author) is no exception.I'm by no means an expert in the field of ML, so perhaps I am just not the intended audience. I'm curious if other people here felt the same way when reading though.Hopefully this observation / opinion isn't too negative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of teams can do a lot with search with just LLMs in the loop on query and index side doing enrichment that used to be months-long projects. Even with smaller, self hosted models and fairly naive prompts you can turn a search string into a more structured query - and cache the hell out of it. Or classify documents into a taxonomy. All backed by boring old lexical or vector search engine. In fact I’d say if you’re NOT doing this you’re making a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450732</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Worst Programmer" discusses the traits and behaviors that can lead to poor programming practices. It emphasizes that a programmer's efficiency is not solely dependent on technical skills, but also on their ability to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and adapt to changes. The author identifies common pitfalls such as stubbornness, lack of curiosity, and an unwillingness to learn from mistakes, arguing that these qualities can significantly hinder a programmer's growth and impact on a team. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a mindset oriented towards improvement and collaboration to combat these negative traits.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of measuring individual developer productivity is kind of absurd to me. I'm not saying that what we do is magic, there are just so many variables.Measuring story points or lines of code is kind of the opposite of productivity. This encourages developers to do as much meaningless work as possible. I'd want a developer to make a task simpler or use an existing tool which means less time writing code. The value of them saving that work from knowing another way is high but hard to measure.What you want is measuring business outcomes but those are hard to attribute to a particular developer.I think unfortunately we're left with our subjective judgement here. I think we'd do better admitting to ourselves that we can't measure this than to pretend we have some sort of science here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used to be bitten by stuff like this until I figured out something Tim and this author apparently didn’t - the problem is trivially fixed by management by attaching tim’s name to any tickets he may have helped out on. he can ask his teammates to do this and they gladly will, or, nice teammates will usually throw a “figured this out with the help of @Tim” in the ticket. goes a long way to keep “tim” on your team against obtuse velocity metrics like this.productivity metrics aren’t entirely worthless. if I come into a team, for instance, and I see they have 1 PR mapped to roughly every 1 jira ticket, and I see a guy on a 3 person team that’s got 70% of the PR’s in a year, that isn’t a clueless piece of info. he’s probably the lead. not always, and people game stuff like this, but it is a data point you can make note of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad to hear that Tim stayed and author managed to steer the entire process towards the right direction. Which requires a listening manager.I experienced the "bad ending" of this productivity metric trickle down: OKR. This startup wanted not just team-based 3-month review Objective Key Result but also individual one, and on top of it, tied stock option to OKR. It was a robotics startup so very cross-domain teams (Software, Hardware, Embedded, DevOps, HW design, HW testing, HW maintenance etc etc).The result? Developers became lonely islands. There were no "Tim" anymore. When I (Software Integrator) encountered an issue, that I just couldn't figure out but had a hunch it must be a deep-rooted issue, went to the expert (control/kinematics) for feedback. The answer I got was "I'm sorry I really want to help you but my OKR deadline is very close, and I simply don't have time". He could've probably fixed it in a day or less, but it ended up taking 2 weeks.The problem turned out to be quite deep: inside layer upon layer of C++ mega monorepo, I found that boost library and a custom kinematics library had implicit struct copy and the different libraries (more than two) used different order for representing translation &amp; rotation (xyz, rpy, Euler, Quaternion) and all of the ordering of each components were different. Somehow over 2 years of operation nobody got troubled by this until our new team had to use it.Afaik I reported it to the Software team, but again, because OKR, nothing was done about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452649</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;A Florida man contracted a rare and serious infection after eating the meat of a feral pig. The case highlights the potential health risks associated with consuming wild game, particularly in regions where such animals can carry harmful bacteria. The infection, attributed to a biothreat bacterium, serves as a warning about the dangers of hunting and consuming feral animals without proper precautions.&lt;/p&gt;

Two years back I had a month stretch in stomach pains. The worst I ever had. I had this on and off for 2-4 years. Happened once a year and was gone. I went to multiple doctors and did bloodtests etc. I then had a Colonoscopy and Gastroscopy. They want some scared tissue in my duodenum. Reason was some bacteria or fungi which they where then able to test for. Wich is funny because they did all kinds of bloodtests before … Long story short, I received a special antibiotic and everything was fine. My theory was that I eat something problematic while being in Egypt around 2018.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The clickbait headline should be replaced by one that somewhere mentions the word "brucellosis", because that's what he had.  We aren't talking about exotica like meningococcemia, ehrlichiosis, or meloidosis here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Though he couldn’t recall the specific hunter who gave him the biohazardous bounty, he remembered handling the raw meat and blood with his bare hands—a clear transmission risk—before cooking and eating it.Well, of course he could perfectly recall, but he's not going to rat out his friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43414743</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The seL4 whitepaper outlines the design, implementation, and properties of the seL4 microkernel, emphasizing its high assurance and security features. It details the formal verification processes that ensure the kernel is free from critical bugs and vulnerabilities, making it suitable for safety-critical applications in industries such as aerospace and automotive. The paper discusses the architecture, performance, and capabilities of seL4, highlighting its role in facilitating secure, reliable systems while enabling developers to build trustworthy applications through a separation of concerns and formal methods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SeL4 is old news - not a criticism, but has anyone added another formally proven layer or component? (Edit: I mean new components beyond the microkernel, not improvements to the microkernel.)Also, I suspect some people - maybe some on HN :) - get emotional overload when they see the word 'proof' and their intellectual functions stop. It's not a panacea for the infinite problem of secure IT; it isn't a way to create or discover a perfect and flawless diamond of software. IIUC it means it's proven to meet specific requirements in specific conditions, and those requirements and conditions can be quite narrow; and it says nothing about other functions and conditions that are out of spec. Is that roughly correct?What does it mean in practical terms? What does a security professional see when they see 'formally proven software'?What are the specs that SeL4 meet (no, I haven't looked at the OP in a long time)? Isn't that the essential information here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a fan of microkernel hosts for guest monoliths, thus our servers are running seL4 as safety layer and backups for FreeBSD VMs with jails for renderfarm, BEAM clusters and Jenkins.All I’m missing is an ARM port of DragonflyBSD for its threading and in-process kernels (hybrid kernel design). My dream is to run it on 128 cores Ampere Altra to run OpenMoonRay more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://genode.org/indexAn operating system with seL4 support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452185</guid></item><item><title>6. argp: GNU-style command line argument parser for Go</title><link>https://github.com/tdewolff/argp</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "argp" by tdewolff provides a Go library designed for parsing command-line arguments. It offers a simple and efficient way to define and manage command-line interfaces in Go applications. The library supports features such as automatic help message generation, type coercion, and flags, making it easy for developers to implement user-friendly command-line tools. The repository includes documentation, examples, and installation instructions, facilitating quick integration and use within Go projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general, command-line argument parsers should just follow the GNU style. No more, no less. Deviations confuse users as it is not immediately obvious to them what rules a parser is imposing.&gt; options can have multiple values: -a 1 2 3 means that a is an array/slice/struct of three numbers of value [1,2,3]Allowing multiple values is inconsistent because you can't tell in "./cmd -a 1 2 3" whether 2 and 3 are positional arguments or arguments for -a. This is not a GNU style. The GNU way is "./cmd -a 1 -a 2 -a 3" (or "./cmd -a 1,2,3"). This package supports that, which is good.&gt; option values can be separated by a space, equal sign, or nothing: -a1 -a=1 -a 1 are all equal"--a=1" is a GNU style but "-a=1" is not. This is a minor issue, though.Also, does this package support "--"? Everything following "--" should be treated as positional arguments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cobra https://github.com/spf13/cobra uses https://github.com/spf13/pflag, which supports GNU style flags. Cobra has been developed for many years now and has a ton of additional features, like automatically generating the autocompletions and has tons of unit tests.I'd just use cobra.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've become a fan of https://github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (also enjoyed structopt which is similar for Rust). I much prefer defining the flags statically on a type which stores them after rather than building it all up programmatically.Otherwise, I'm not really sure what this offers that alternatives don't, apart from the -a 1 2 3 -&gt; [1,2,3] business which seems highly confusing and undesirable to me so I'd think of it as more of an anti-feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452525</guid></item><item><title>7. 300-year-old Polish beech voted Tree of the Year</title><link>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20dd6yk55yo</link><description>

It seems that the concept of a “Chorded Keyboard” from Douglas then spawned several relatively successful successors later on:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorded_keyboardGrowing up in the Netherlands in the 80s it was hard to not be aware of the “Velotype”: it had more keys and supposedly made it easier to learn the “chords”.Your reference to the book Nerds 2.0.1 is great, the book is a companion to the excelent PBS 3-part series from 1998https://archive.org/details/movies?tab=collection&amp;query=Nerd...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The original chording keyboard was from Baudot, around 1897.[1] The original plan was for the sender to send 5-bit teletype characters with a 5-bit keyboard.

The beauty of the backgrounds was a huge part of the appeal. I wound up administering the Relic forums for many years.

Or that's the sensitivity it will reach, eventually; the one they've released now is still incomplete.[a] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deep_fields[b] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/03/aa51857-...[c] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2017/12/aa30833-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Euclid is such a cool mission and this first tranche is merely 0.4% of what we'll eventually be getting.

I ended up selling it to offset the cost of a fancy monitor for my Amiga :-).Related Steve Ciarcia did a vector display which was a lot of fun back in the day. You can find it in the back issues of BYTE but here is a scan https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y6SfEN8idhdZ7Y_rNh0zD9uzHEC...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got to play on a Vectrex back in the day, it was super-fun -- especially because I had worked at Cinematronix before that. I really wish Vectrex was more successful, but vector displays were just super-limited. The positive of being pseudo-high-res wasn't enough to overcome the fact that you literally couldn't draw more than about 40-80 lines (depending on how long the lines were and how far apart they were).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked for Jay Smith, the inventor &amp; CEO of the company that made the Vectrex, after the Vectrex was already off the market. I wrote PlayStation 1 games at his company, where Jay is also the guy that basically invented realistic physics for bowling games. We wrote the Tiger Woods PGA Golf game with the South Park scandal at Adrenalin Interactive (Jay's company.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43449326</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses mathematical concepts related to derivatives, logarithms, and transforms, focusing on their applications and interrelationships. It outlines the rules and properties of derivatives, the fundamentals of logarithmic functions, and provides insights into various mathematical transforms, such as Fourier and Laplace transforms. Examples and equations are included to illustrate the concepts, making it a resource for those looking to deepen their understanding of these mathematical topics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition to the differential equation, you can also tweak the definition of the exponential function as a limit used with e.g. compound interest:    exp(tA) = lim n-&gt;infinity (I+tA/n)^n
    = lim n-&gt;infinity (I+tA/n)...(I+tA/n) (n times)

So you can interpret A (or log T) as a direction to move from the identity, and exp does infinite iterated compositions of an infinitesimal shift away from the identity in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool article. Regarding section "The exponential map and logarithm map", if you're interested in computing the matrix exponential, there is the classic: C Moler, C Van Loan, "Nineteen dubious ways to compute the exponential of a matrix, twenty-five years later". Also, using the series expansion is not necessarily unrobust as long as you don't stop at a fixed number of iterations but instead go on as long as terms have a norm greater than some tolerance. Scaling and squaring can be used to remain always in a given range of norms (less than 1, say).Regarding Pitfall #3, the interpolation scheme exp(tlog(A) + (1-t)log(B)) is shortest path in a sense, just not with the usual matrix norms. See V Arsigny et al., "Log‐Euclidean metrics for fast and simple calculus on diffusion tensors". I can't help but find it more elegant than exp(log(BA^{-1})t)A which could just as well have been exp(log(A^{-1}B)t)A, or even Aexp(log(A^{-1}B)t), right? It also fixes the "no more than two transforms", as you can put any convex combination in exp(sum_i x_i log(A_i)).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just amazed that applets are still being used and are still working. Many folks here are younger than Java Applet technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43430498</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because bash for some goddamn reason loads the bashrc for interactive shells AND when started by sshd, regardless of whether the shell is interactive or an tty is present. Bash (and only bash) literally has a special case for sshd to enable this kind of exploit.As a result of this, git and rsync wont work at all if the bashrc on the remote machine writes any data to stdout.

I was unable to secure sponsorship by anyone and just gave up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We can’t change git’s shell to /sbin/nologin or /bin/false, or users wouldn’t be able to connect over SSH.Git actually has a solution for this!

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about Play-ARP, a project related to the Orgelstadt Hamburg initiative. It focuses on an interactive platform that allows users to engage with the art of organ playing, exploring various musical pieces and enhancing their understanding of the organ's capabilities. The site offers insights into the history of the organ, resources for players of all levels, and encourages community participation in music appreciation and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

I produce French pipe organ sample sets for a living : https://www.jeuxdorgues.comIt's an extroardinary journey to record an organ, process the thousands of WAV files and design a virtual organ model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is super cool! I've advocated for spreading the organ to a modern audience through websites before, so it's great to see someone doing this.In fact, I've been working off and on on my own virtual pipe organ software[1], except based around modular synthesis. I've found most modular synthesis engines don't have great support for blended midi and audio nodes, and often don't have good resources management, so I started from scratch.[1] https://github.com/wwtos/mjuo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can play it with your ASCII keyboard as well, as if it were a piano keyboard.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses emerging research that suggests a potential link between viral infections and the development of Alzheimer's disease. It highlights studies indicating that certain viruses may trigger neuroinflammation or other pathological processes associated with Alzheimer's. The piece also explores the implications of these findings for understanding the disease's etiology, prevention strategies, and future treatment options. Overall, it emphasizes the need for further investigation into the role of viruses in Alzheimer's to better inform public health approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

For e.g., https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914577/Amantadine is a related compound that's seemingly more potent as an antiviral, and less potent at the NMDA receptor.Medical hypothesis: This makes me wonder if amantadine might be an effective drug in Alzheimer's treatment.  It would come as a total shock to the med chem community if memantine's activity had to do with its suppression of viral replication, and much less to do with its activity at the NMDA receptor.As an aside, the Russians have a similar drug called bromantane which is sold OTC as a sort of mental energy booster.  It's not really a stimulant, and its effects are mild enough for daily use.  It might also be very interesting in this context. 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromantane&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there is something to viruses being a big agent of aging.  I'm 40 and recently came down with a bad case of norovirus, followed by some kind of flu-like thing.  3 weeks of illness.  Afterwards, I felt as if I had aged 10 years, and looking into the mirror it was like looking at what I will probably look like at 50.It made me wonder how much of aging is mediated by damage from infection, which we fight off, but come out of weaker for it.It certainly makes me want to double check all my vaccines, and once my kids are older, practice a little better hygiene including things like masking up in tight spaces (pretty much impossible with a 6 and 9 year old in the house, they are the vector right now).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451397</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of placebos, emphasizing that not all placebos are the same and exploring the factors that influence their effectiveness. It highlights the role of patients' expectations, the context in which placebos are administered, and individual differences in response to placebo treatments. The piece argues for a nuanced understanding of how different types of placebos can yield varying outcomes in clinical settings, advocating for further research to optimize placebo use in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I never see discussed (though if you have resources on the subject, please share them with me) are the very real and important difference between believing and wanting to believe and feeling better about something without the something itself being better.When I feel like my symptoms have improved, that is factually distinct from my symptoms having improved. Ok, so far so obvious. But it is also factually distinct from me really feeling like my symptoms have improved. It may very well be that I'm just not sure and that I subconsciously lean toward giving the benefit of the doubt as a tie-breaker for my own uncertainty. And then I can feel better about that without the underlying symptom improving, and that is definitely factually distinct from the symptom improving.The impact would obviously be age-related, since age equals exposure to factors like social influence, introspective knowledge of the limits of self evaluation, and so on.And it is not the same thing as a placebo effect improving the symptom itself. I can be experiencing the exact same amount of pain but wishy-washy on the evaluation, but people report on the placebo effect as though it means I experience less pain. But maybe I'm just less frustrated by the pain, or less inclined to admit the pain to myself or to others, or less inclined to trust myself. Maybe believing feels good, so I want to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a theory why placebo works: It may be caused by the "Selfish Gene".When my sub-conscious believes the body is dying it decides it's for the best of the whole gene-population that the individual in question stops fighting for resources and for reproductive opportunities in the world. It would be wasteful to use scarce resources for me, not from the viewpoint of me the individual, but from the viewpoint of the gene-population.But if I do believe the doctor's pill will cure me soon, then the sub-conscious "thinks" that it must be more true than not, because who can we believe more than the experts? So it's time for it to NOT give up my fight for the survival of the fittest, but to help me do it.In other words if my subconscious believes I am dying soon, it would not make sense (from the viewpoint of the gene-population) to take away scarce resources from other individuals who are NOT dying soon.The "Selfish Gene" is in fact the most unselfish thing there is, it is guided by what is best for all of us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a common misconception about placebos that they are merely a "reporting/statistical effect", but this is inaccurate. The placebo effect can have measurable effects on things that are not subjective. Wiki cites (in response to a controversial study claiming to have found the placebo effect is not "real") : "...the existence of placebo effects seems undeniable. For example, recent research has linked placebo interventions to improved motor functions in patients with Parkinson's disease. Other objective outcomes affected by placebos include immune and endocrine parameters, end-organ functions regulated by the autonomic nervous system, and sport performance." [1] And that should not be taken as an exhaustive list of examples - placebos can show objectively measurable improvements in a vast array of domains. It's certainly real.The evil twin of the placebo, the nocebo, has even more dramatic proof of its realness: "there is a small group of patients in whom the realization of impending death is a blow so terrible that they are quite unable to adjust to it, and they die rapidly before the malignancy seems to have developed enough to cause death. This problem of self-willed death is in some ways analogous to the death produced in primitive peoples by witchcraft ('pointing the bone')". [2] This could also largely explain why elderly married couples tend to follow each other into the grave in short order - dying of heartbreak, perhaps not being an entirely rhetorical expression.[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Effects[2] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo#Ambiguity_of_anthropolo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434364</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The page provides information about the `@hyperdrive-eng/mcp-nodejs-debugger` package, which is a Node.js debugging tool designed for developers using the MCP (Multichain Protocol) ecosystem. It outlines the installation steps, usage instructions, and includes code examples to help users effectively implement the debugger in their projects. The package aims to enhance the development experience by offering features that simplify debugging processes and improve code quality in applications built on the Hyperdrive platform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor often gets into "dead loops" trying to fix code [1][2]. But, Cursor also seems to get out of dead loops when it adds `console.log` statements everywhere.We thought: "What if Cursor could access Node.js at runtime?". That would save it from adding `console.log` everywhere, and still get out of dead loops.We looked into it and got Cursor to debug Node.js on its own.It's a prototype, but if you're interested in trying it out, we'd love some feedback!Github: github.com/hyperdrive-eng/mcp-nodejs-debugger---References:[1]: "At this point I feel like giving up on Cursor and just accept that WE'RE NOT THERE YET." ~Source: https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-for-complex-projects/38911[2]: "We've all had the issue. You're trying to build a complex project with your AI companion. It runs into a dead loop, coding in circles, making suggestions it already tried that didn't work." ~Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1gz8fxb/solu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using Cursor extensively on TS projects and noticed a big improvement in speed and code quality by enforcing clear guardrails (strict types, linting, formatting) combined with rigorous TDD. When I hit an error or exception, I explicitly tell the agent to pause and first figure out the best way to debug and quickly pinpoint the root cause. This approach generally works well, provided I’ve decomposed the problem enough that we’re debugging just one thing at a time (though that’s not always trivial).I’m interested to try this out to see if or how much it speeds things up further.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related but I decided to try out Claude Code and one of the first things I noticed is that it didn't seem to be checking for basic transpilation errors (this was in a Typescript project). I added the following bit to the CLAUDE.md file (which is the equivalent of the assistant's LLM guidelines):   - `npm run build` - Run TypeScript compilation + Vite build. You should periodically run this to check for errors.
 
And it made a pretty significant difference when "autotake suggestions" was on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43446659</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a peculiar behavior in Windows where certain file operations can fail if the system is heavily loaded. It highlights a specific scenario involving a developer trying to create and delete files rapidly, only to encounter inconsistent results due to the operating system’s resource allocation and management under stress. The author provides insights into the underlying principles of file handling in Windows and emphasizes the importance of designing applications robustly to handle such failures gracefully. The piece serves as both an informative account of a niche issue and guidance for developers to improve software reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at Microsoft's C code makes my eyes hurt. I don't know if it's the style (bracket placement, no new lines), naming conventions, typedeffing away pointers, or what, but it just doesn't read easily to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or rather, "the case of a buggy lazy-init function which reinitialized the critical section every time"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I don't understand why they're making a critical section at all.The end goal is to initialize something no more than once, right? But the technology they're using (wrongly, but it did exist and they were clearly aware of it) to make a critical section does initialize a thing exactly once.I also don't understand the use of SRWLock here, or rather, I sort of do but it's a hole in Microsoft's technology stack. SRWLock is a complicated (and as it turns out, buggy, but that's not relevant here) tool, but all we want here is a mutex, so we don't actually need SRWLock except that Microsoft doesn't provide the simple mutex, so this really is what you'd have written at the time† - conjure into existence the over-complicated SRWLock and just don't use most of its functionality.† Today you should do the same trick as a Linux futex although you spell it differently in Windows. It's also optionally smaller, which is nice for this sort of job, a futex costs 4 bytes but in Windows we can spend just one byte.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451525</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The project "First Known Photographs of Living Specimens" on iNaturalist aims to document and compile the first photographic records of various species in their natural living states. It encourages users to contribute by sharing their own photographs of species that have not had previously documented images taken while alive. The initiative serves to highlight the importance of visual records in biodiversity studies and to create an accessible database of living specimens for scientific and educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

Note that by 'first known' I'm referring to the first known photographs of a species anywhere, not just the first photographs to be submitted to iNaturalist.&gt;Two types of observation will be included:
1) First photographic records of undescribed species...
2) First photographic records of already described (but obviously relatively uncommon or cryptic) species...&gt;If the male and female of a species are sexually dimorphic, then both are valid to be added to the project. So too if a species has distinct life stages (eg caterpillar/chrysalis/butterfly), they are all valid to be separately added to the project (assuming the other rules apply).&gt;If you see an observation currently in the project that you know is not the first photograph of that species, and you can show the earlier photograph, please do not hesitate to message me and I'll remove it.It clearly states the photograph has to be the first photograph someone ever taken of the species which they have published(journal/news/book etc.) or publicly shared. Also, historical pictures are welcome, as long as you took the picture. I have seen scanned images uploaded to the project dating back to the 1960s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within the context of iNaturalist. Anyhow, cheers to the iNaturalist team, the work they do and their Seek app. It’s one of the only apps I recommend friends to give to their children to explore, appreciate, and learn about the natural world around them. I just hope they stay relevant in the ChatGPT world. TBH I often use a combination of the two when trying to ID something out in the wild, and ChatGPT many times does a better job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know the guy that created that project, he's also published a paper on how important and valuable it's been for species monitoring and conservation

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guitar player here. App looks great, but shame it's only for piano. I used a different app that does pretty much the same thing and really benefited from it, the improvement was noticeable after each session.If you add guitar support it will be an immediate download for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet another HN moment for me: I use it, and as I bought/downloaded like 50 or more - I think it is the best out there.Given that I might have you „on the feedback phoneline” I have thoughts, I’d like to share:- It might not be true, but it seems that notes are picked at random so sometimes I feel there’s disharmony which somewhat distracts me - in age of LLMs maybe it would be plausible to ask for generation of more harmonic sounding sequences?- I don’t practice sight reading often but when I do I usually practice longer than 1-3 minutes - clicking through lessons to get to the next one is distracting - I’d enjoy endless auto-progress (that is - keep progress structure so no free training but just auto start next one)- I’d like to have minimalistic practice mode (I.e. follow progression but without any aids at all) - I repeat lessons but my brain flips lazy mode when it sees helpers.I’d like to thank you for making this app accessible in terms of price though. However I have resources and want to support developers I believe in which includes you and your application. I’d suggest „coffee subscription” - I.e. completely optional no-features added but visible and I’d be glad to enable and forget about it.In fun-fact context: I have some uncommon traits and my educational needs are different from general population (I cannot do repetitions and I have multisensory aphantasia - can’t hear sounds in my head - so can’t memorize them) and your app so far helped building passive eye-muscle link which I find fascinating on its own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, I've been using notequest before and this really hits a string for my needs. There are some places that could be improved.
1. There is lacking logic in the notes, there should be some kind of pattern that an LLM could create that sounds better. For example for left hand usually there could be eg. walking bass/ chord progressions etc, instead of  just random notes.

Industry-wide, only about 10% of users find a long-term partner. Hinge? Roughly 5%.However, this is not what their linked source says:&gt; Tinder is also the most successful matchmaker, with 29.6% of respondents engaged or married to a partner from the app. Bumble and Hinge trail behind at 12.9% and 5%, respectively.5% of survey respondents were engaged or married to someone from hinge. This reflects the relative popularity of the different apps, not your odds of finding love on them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After finding my partner on Hinge (following years of dating apps, setups, and in-person approaches), I've reflected on this journey. Despite the countless disappointing dates, the 3-year struggle ultimately proved worthwhile.However, I'm troubled by how profit motives distort online dating. The business model incentivizes engagement over meaningful connections, creating a system where genuine relationships feel like marketing bait for swipe addiction.Hinge worked best for me and several friends, but I suspect its designers know how to better facilitate connections—improvements they avoid implementing because they would hurt revenue.This has sparked my interest in creating an open-source, non-profit dating platform—one designed to address loneliness without answering to shareholders who prioritize metrics over human well-being.I’m not sure that I’ll ever go through with it but I think it would be a worthwhile project to consider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the accepted truth that dating apps like Hinge are terrible for finding long-term partners ignores the fact that most people are not really trying to use them to find a long-term partner. They might say they wanted to find a long-term partner, but that doesn't correspond to their use of the app. They aren't using them in any kind of dedicated or organized way. They just load them up when they're bored and waste a bit of time aimlessly swiping, messaging the odd match and going on the occasional date.It's a bit like if I say I want to write a novel, but all I do is sporadically open up Google Docs and write for 30 minutes before losing inspiration and doing something else. If I never write a book, is that Google Docs fault, or mine? Despite their flaws, I think modern dating apps actually provide a pretty good toolset for finding a long-term partner. But like any tool, your results will depend mostly on your skill and dedication in putting it to use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43432151</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Bitter Lesson" by Ankit Maloo discusses the importance of leveraging computation in artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. It highlights that algorithms that utilize larger amounts of data and computational power tend to outperform human-designed approaches. The author emphasizes that relying on brute-force computation can yield better results over time, as demonstrated by various AI breakthroughs. Additionally, the piece suggests a paradigm shift where future advancements in AI would be driven more by scaling up computational resources rather than solely by human ingenuity. The main takeaway is that embracing the capabilities of computation is crucial for the future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a blog post of 1,200 words the bitter lesson has done more damage to AI research and funding than blowing up a nuclear bomb at neurips would.Every time I try to write a reasonable blog post about why it's wrong it blows up to tens of thousands of words and no one can be bothered to read it, let alone the supporting citations.In the spirit of low effort anec-data pulled from memory:The raw compute needed to brute force any problem can only be known after the problem is solved. There is no sane upper limit to how much computation, memory and data any given task will take and humans are terrible at estimating how hard tasks actually are. We are after all only 60 years late for the undergraduate summer project that would solve computer vision.Today VLMs are the best brute force approach to solving computer vision we have, and they look like they will take a PB of state to solve and the compute needed to train them will be available some time around 2040.What do we do with the problems that are too hard to solve with the limited compute that we have? Lie down for 80 years and wait for compute to catch up? Or solve a smaller problem using specialized tricks that don't require a $10B super computer to build?The bitter lesson is nothing of the sort, there is plenty of space for thinking hard, and there always will be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going back to the original "Bitter Lesson" article, I think the analogy to chess computers could be instructive here. A lot of institutional resources were spent trying to achieve "superhuman" chess performance, it was achieved, and today almost the entire TAM for computer chess is covered by good-enough Stockfish, while most of the money tied up in chess is in matching human players with each other across the world, and playing against computers is sort of what you do when you're learning, or don't have an internet connection, or you're embarrassed about your skill and don't want to get trash-talked by an Estonian teenager.The "Second Bitter Lesson" of AI might be that "just because massive amounts of compute make something possible doesn't mean that there will be a commensurately massive market to justify that compute"."Bitter Lesson" I think also underplays the amount of energy and structure and design that has to go into compute-intensive systems to make them succeed: Deep Blue and current engines like Stockfish take advantage of tablebases of opening and closing positions that are more like GOFAI than deep tree search. And the current crop of LLMs are not only taking advantage of expanded compute, but of the hard-won ability of companies in the 21st century to not only build and resource massive server farms, but mobilize armies of contractors in low-COL areas to hand-train models into usefulness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The time span on which these developments take place matter a lot for whether the bitter lesson is relevant to a particular AI deployment. The best AI models of the future will not have 100K lines of hand-coded edge cases, and developing those to make the models of today better won't be a long-term way to move towards better AI.On the other hand, most companies don't have unlimited time to wait for improvements on the core AI side of things, and even so building competitive advantages like a large existing customer base or really good private data sets to train next-gen AI tools have huge long-term benefits.There's been an extraordinary amount of labor hours put into developing games that could run, through whatever tricks were necessary, on whatever hardware actually existed for consumers at the time the developers were working. Many of those tricks are no longer necessary, and clearly the way to high-definition real-time graphics was not in stacking 20 years of tricks onto 2000-era hardware. I don't think anyone working on that stuff actually thought that was going to happen, though. Many of the companies dominating the gaming industry now are the ones that built up brands and customers and experience in all of the other aspects of the industry, making sure that when better underlying scaling came there they had the experience, revenue, and know-how to make use of that tooling more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451742</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“I had some really good, famous, climbers come in and fail the belay test,”Climbers still complain about the belay test, especially older climbers who cut their teeth outdoors and same late to the gym scene. But most gym accidents involving top roping or lead climbing are going to come down to a failed safety check or a mistake on the part of the belayer. And a failed safety check is at least partially a belayer failure.Experience level doesn't necessarily correlate with safe technique. Beginners can be highly conscious of the consequences of a fall, where more experienced climbers can get complacent and sloppy when the negative consequences fail to materialize.For example: the coach of an internationally competitive athlete dropped his climber on a grigri because he was casually chatting with someone on the ground and failed to control the brake strand.https://youtu.be/WBGkKqLhM8Y?si=p58XDsgOG5O2dbJP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSA: Most modern gyms have "autobelay" devices that let you climb on your own without a partner. This makes gym climbing a super fun and accessible exercise anyone, even beginners, can do by just showing up to a gym at your convenience.(If you're a beginner you should still take the 1 hour class first and you will have to pass a belay test. And yes, if you can make the schedule work out with a friend so can belay each other, that's even more fun)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;I got no positive reaction from the [climbing] industry at allThis was my experience trying to create a climbing tech product in the last few years.The market for climbing is built through reputation, tradition, &amp; thus a visceral rejection of new ideas &amp; methods. This is very interesting, since many climbers work in forward-thinking tech companies.Companies often resist growth to stay small. There are dirty secrets and bad blood among many competitors.Amazing sport, hard fought market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43415540</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple notes looking at the c++ implementation- this is going to have problems with non-trivial types.  (Think about destructors or move constructors like std::unique_ptr).  If you don't want to deal with them, at least add a static_assert(std::is_trivially_copyable&lt;T&gt;::value == true);- front() doesn't return a reference and it doesn't even return the front- adding iterators (begin()/end()) will let it play nice with for( : ) loops and &lt;algorithms&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This implementation grows indefinitely if you repeatedly push to the head and remove from the tail, even if the max number of elements in the array is small&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main benefit list gives you comparing to vector is a stable memory. This is often an important property. But lists are slow with an element access. This problem is solved by deque.Therefore, I argue that alternative to deque has to have a stable memory property. Otherwise, you can just use a vector.This implementation is trying to do so, btw, but for some reasons it operates with a raw memory under the hood instead of just holding a vector and rotating it here and there. Such approach is unnecessary complicated and error-prone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43456669</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Localized Wavepackets in a 1D Quantum System: Exact Solutions and Their Dynamics" presents a study of localized wavepacket solutions in a one-dimensional quantum system. The authors derive exact solutions for the time evolution of these wavepackets under specific potentials, analyzing their stability and dynamics. The paper discusses the implications of these solutions for quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of wavepacket spreading and localization phenomena. Additionally, it provides a theoretical framework that could be applied to explore such localized states in various quantum systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The elbow method has a simple theoretical justification. If the data actually has k well-separated clusters, the gains from splitting halves of clusters should be dramatically less than from splitting distinct clusters. If that isn't true, the data doesn't have well-separated clusters anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since when did researchers decide to start titling their papers like clickbait YouTube videos?The “Stop doing [conventional thing]!” title formula is, for whatever reason, the title that I always find the most annoying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ...  much better alternatives such as the variance-ratio criterion (VRC) of Calinski and Harabasz [6], the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC), or the Gap statistics should always be preferred instead.That's fair.And: clustering algorithms are unsupervised by definition, therefore there is no correct answer.In my experience, the use case almost always controls which algorithm (k-means, DBSCAN, etc.) will be best as well as the parameters chosen, e.g. k if that is available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450550</guid></item><item><title>35.

The author emphasizes the importance of regular updates and privacy settings adjustments to maintain a secure browsing experience, as well as suggesting the use of private browsing mode and password management tools. Overall, the piece aims to educate users on effectively utilizing Safari to safeguard their privacy while navigating the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two little-appreciated privacy features in Safari not mentioned in the article:Each private browsing tab has its own cookie / data bucket[1]; andPrivate browsing tabs and windows are preserved across restarts. (This is optional and can be configured to forget them upon restart.)These make it practical to use private browsing for nearly all browsing, which isn't really the case in other browsers, where private browsing is clearly designed as an occasional-use thing. (And of course if you use private browsing for most things, you can still open regular windows for sites where you want to stay logged in.)[1] If a link or script in a tab opens a new tab or window, then they share the same cookie bucket. This preserves compatibility with sites that require such a flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hahaha holy moly they are linking to https://adblock.turtlecute.org/index.html to prove how great their adblocking is.That site then says:I found that the uBlock Origin extension breaks the final result. To fix it, add adblock.turtlecute.org as an exception in uBlock rules.Exactly the kind of belly laugh I needed right now. That side also falsely "measures" that my ad blocker lets all kinds of sites through when in fact my setup lets absolute zero third party sites through. Hilarious!I wonder how many people fall for sites like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author might be misunderstanding the fingerprint test — having a unique fingerprint is bad, as it allows tracking of you by fingerprinting, without the need for cookies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43453350</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common misconception surrounding liquid detection features in Apple devices, particularly how they react to moisture. It explains that many users believe that these features are designed to prevent damage from spills, but they often lead to misunderstanding and unnecessary concerns about device functionality. The author delves into how these systems work, the types of indicators used, and offers insights into their effectiveness and limitations, ultimately emphasizing the importance of not overreacting to liquid contact warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One time I was caught out in heavy rain, and when I later tried to plug in my iPhone I got a message saying the lightning port was disabled until it could dry out. There was even an emergency override option, which I opted not to use. Seems like a nice feature to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't need to send anything to Apple.  A tech could read a log or CMOS bit or whatever at time of repair.  Not saying they do that but the article seems pretty pointless.  It's like they wanted to talk about a neat feature and chose the most indigent way possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN (and other forums) are great sources of myths. It goes like this:- Person A asks a question and proposes a suggestion- Person B responds to the suggestion and adds more complaints- Person C either agrees or disagrees with A and B's claims, but adds an argument which adds more detail/fills in more gaps and adds more suggestionsAt no point does anyone say "hold on, do any of you have any empirical evidence of anything you've said?" Everybody just kind of accepts every premise, and then argues it as if it's a valid premise. That acceptance of the false premise is the bedrock on which invented ideas become commonly-held beliefs.I think this is part of what makes AIs hallucinate. These conversations get ingested by the AIs and make connections between these claims, which it will see again and again as the myths are repeated from forum to forum. Later it will make correlations between the conversations and there isn't anything solid enough for it to determine which is real or not. I've seen it recently when analyzing adhesives, where it will not only quote the wrong information about an adhesive (despite it already having the TDS in its database), but also it'll make up fake adhesives that are clearly a mash-up of two real adhesives.(See, I've just done it... completely talking out of my ass about a subject I don't know anything about, but sounds plausible)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43424709</guid></item><item><title>38.

It's not Tinder.US HR used to throw away any photos that people attached to resumes.  (Usually someone attaching a photo was a recent immigrant, who didn't know the US convention.)I've even heard rumors that some companies/screeners had a policy of throwing away resumes that included photos or other gratuitous information that could be the basis for illegal/problematic discrimination."Because LinkedIn does it" isn't a good argument, because LinkedIn is pretty awful, and the only things going for it are: (1) the majority of people are on it, and (2) recruiters sometimes search/spam there.Some social media sites do photos because they pander to the worst.  Or, in the case of one prominent social media site, infamously because the original inspiration was to catalog the best-looking women at their college.Unless you're a headshots site/app for hiring models/actors, best to go with content-of-their-character, and all that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I apologize this is not directly related to OP, but if you, like myself, get mad at all the "Suggested" posts LinkedIn is pushing on you, you can use the following ublock filter to get rid of these posts:    www.linkedin.com##:xpath(//span[text()="Suggested"]//ancestor::div/div[contains(@data-id, "activity")])

Combined with carefully managing who I actually follow, it made it for a much more pleasant experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In tech, I have found the best way to stand out is a personal technical blog. Write about things you’ve worked on. Doing is the best way to learn, and writing about doing is the second best way to show you know.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the "compressed book edition," a concept that combines the physical and digital realms of books, specifically aimed at minimizing energy consumption. It explores the environmental impact of traditional book production and highlights how a compressed book can be more sustainable by reducing the amount of paper and ink used. The piece examines the potential benefits of this format in addressing issues of waste and energy in the publishing industry, while also considering the balance between digital accessibility and the tactile experience of physical books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the possibility that the global human population may be significantly larger than current estimates suggest. It highlights recent research indicating that traditional methods of counting population, such as censuses and surveys, might fail to capture the full scope of human existence, especially in regions with high mobility, informal settlements, or where data collection is challenging. The author emphasizes the implications of underestimating population numbers for resource allocation and planning, particularly in terms of sustainability and climate change. This exploration raises questions about how population data can be accurately assessed and the potential consequences of misestimating demographic figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Barnacle Goose myth refers to a medieval belief that barnacle geese originated from barnacles, as it was thought that they grew on trees along the coasts and, when mature, transformed into birds. This myth was prevalent in Europe, particularly in the British Isles, where the geese were considered a miraculous food source during Lent, as they were classified as fish due to their supposed non-bird origin. The article details the historical context, the origins of the myth, and its implications for dietary practices and religious observances. It also touches on the eventual debunking of the myth through scientific understanding of the barnacle goose's true life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

And it took what to disprove it?" factoids: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration#Historical_view... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfeilstorchIt seems so simple and common sense and everyday. It doesn't involve microscopic lifeforms or planets or stars, just... birds. "Where do birds go during the winter? Well, birds are good at flying away from hunters or other bad things. That's why they fly. So maybe they just fly somewhere else. I look up in Fall and I see flights of birds flying in a specific direction. And people in other areas say birds arrive from elsewhere for a while. What else would they do? Turn into little fish and hide in the water all winter, or spontaneously regenerate out of random little clams? Anyway, here's a bird with a big old Central African spear stuck through its whole body who managed to fly here alive anyway which proves that."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a creepy Japanese urban myth about a guy who injured his knee at the beach. He developed knee pain, so he went to the doctor, and they discovered barnacles growing inside his kneecap.  
A goose appearance would probably make it goosebump-less.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a good clicker game based on this https://everest-pipkin.com/barnacle-goose/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43431881</guid></item><item><title>44.

Auth is always a relative. The middleware is only there to identify the user. Then when querying for objects, you query objects related to that user.Or if you are serving an admin page you check that the user is an admin.I honestly find it more astounding that people put an admin security check to check the url of a page and redirect away in a middleware and no security on the views themselves.Is this form of checking paths in middleware officially from NextJS or did people just get lazy? Seems like the worst way to build auth I could ever dream up across any framework or language.If a middleware is bypassed all endpoints should return empty responses. In my nextjs apps the middleware is simply a convenience method for the user if they are logged out they get redirected to the login page. But all api endpoints check for the active user and serve objects relative to the user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This very recent PR updates the docs to basically remove all common (and previously recommended) middleware use-cases, rendering them almost completely useless:https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/77438&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451485</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of ChatGPT and similar AI technologies, arguing that they cannot replace the human experiences and nuances that contribute to creativity and meaning in writing and art. It highlights the importance of human intuition, emotion, and individual perspective, suggesting that while AI can assist in generating content, it lacks the depth and soul that make creative works resonate. The author expresses a belief that true creativity and connection can only stem from human experiences, reinforcing the idea that AI, despite its advancements, is not a substitute for genuine human expression.&lt;/p&gt;

It is arranging word patterns. I could tell GPT to add in an anomaly for the 1970s - like the girl looking at Billy’s Instagram - and it would introduce it into the text without a comment about being anomalous."I asked ChatGPT to introduce the girl looking at Billy's instagram. The response:"Instagram didn't exist in the 1970s. Do you want to keep the setting authentic to the '70s or update the story to a contemporary timeframe where Instagram fits naturally?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s always baffling how people take a technology that wasn’t even thought as feasible a decade ago and try to dismiss it as trivial and stagnant. It’s pretty clear that LLMs have improved rapidly and have successfully become better writers than the majority of people alive. To try and present this as just random pattern matching seems as just a way to assuage fears of being replaced.It’s also amusing that people minimize it by just calling it pattern matching, as if human reasoning isn’t built upon recognizing patterns in past experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451166</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the creation of value objects in Ruby using idiomatic practices. It emphasizes the importance of using value objects to encapsulate attributes that represent a specific concept, ensuring immutability and equality based on their values rather than their identity. The author outlines best practices, including how to define a value object class with attributes, implementing equality and comparison methods, and leveraging the Ruby `Struct` class as an alternative for simpler use cases. The overall goal is to help developers create cleaner, more maintainable code by properly utilizing value objects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't usually think of Data when grouping values together in Ruby. Seems like I should. Lucian puts forth a good explainer of when and why they are helpful.To summarize, Data became available a few years ago in Ruby 3.2. You can create value objects by subclassing the Data class with Data.define. Data objects are immutable, comparable and easily greppable. They are constrained in ways Struct, Hash and Class are not. The shorthand removes boilerplate and the constraints create the utility.Measure = Data.define(:amount, :unit)
weight = Measure.new(amount: 50, unit: 'kg')&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article does not do a great job of explaining why creating new classes dynamically is preferable to just defining the class your system needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43421324</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Germany is significantly increasing its military investment in response to evolving security challenges, including heightened tensions in Europe and the need for modernization of its armed forces. The German government plans to allocate a substantial budget to enhance defense capabilities, focusing on procurement of advanced equipment, improved training for soldiers, and bolstering NATO commitments. This strategic shift is part of a broader effort to ensure national security and stabilize regional defense after years of underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article's headline says Germany is "supercharging its military", but for somebody who's been following the development of the German armed forces, it's more like "patching the most glaring, gaping holes".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The key point is that Germany has finally loosened the debt brake, which has particularly strained the social system and infrastructure. In addition to the 1,000 billion euros allocated for social welfare and infrastructure, another 600 billion euros are designated for the military. The former is linked to the tense situation in social systems and the associated right-wing shift in Europe, while the latter is connected to the ongoing fascist counter-revolution in the USA.Since the USA and companies based there are no longer reliable partners, Europe will stand alone in the future. This means that France and Germany are working together on a joint nuclear defense shield to ensure Europe's security and strengthen NATO's eastern borders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's pretty crazy if you look at how much the US is/was spending on NATO in pure dollar amounts.Since that's going to be cut back Germany and to a lesser degree France are the only countries left to take up the slack.I don't have a really strong opinion either way in terms of what's happening in the US or in Europe, but the argument claiming that there's no real reason to spend money on the military seem pretty disingenuous re. Russia.What's the real chances that Russia would do something like a land invasion of Europe? Really, really small.... But military spending is the thing helping keep those chances very small.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43454383</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This may sound like I am joking but I think that engineering types tend to be literalists and could benefit from books with a more direct approach, like “How to be less of a jerk to everyone around you and why that matters” or maybe “It’s not everyone else, you’re the dick”.I should add that I am thinking primarily about people who are inadvertently abrasive, as a result of clumsy interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For any "self help" book, people split into three groups and they take it as 1. Gospel, 2. Nonsense, 3. Somewhere in the middle.I think you have to be in the third group for the books to be useful. You have to be able to pick out the truths and the nonsense. But also I think the nonsense is sometimes helpful to point out the truths.Me and you could read the same book, find it useful but what we took from it was quite different because what we needed was quite different. Even though we fundamentally had the same problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've heard good things about "The Other Significant Others" by NPR's Rhaina Cohen (with the disclosure that the author is the partner of a friend of mine)https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250333025/theothersignifi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43454898</guid></item><item><title>50.

It used to, still is?, be considered a bad idea to follow those install suggestion where it’s `/bin/bash -c $(curl example.com/install.sh)`. These tools are basically that  but even more risky because the code they generate is semi-random.Of course you can evaluate everything it does before it does it. But no one reads the homebrew install script to make sure it’s safe when setting up a new Mac so who’s going to read the Claude code scripts?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn’t read the word “directory” initially, and I was imagining a scenario where the author gave Claude access to an API, and was like “this endpoint will set off a nuke” and then Claude was like “Ok! :3” and triggered it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a bit funny that between trolling and innocent "screw it, burn everything and start over" that every beginner has been through, this is obviously going part of the learning experience... whether you're human or machine.(No, I wouldn't seriously rm -rf ~/ intentionally in most cases but it's not so insane when you imagine creating a new user for project separation. For those reasons it's probably good to keep the agents separate too...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43427236</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quadlet is one of the best things to have come out of Podman and I highly recommend anyone curious about Podman or switch to container-based workloads to check them out. Being able to slot containers in and treat them like essentially any other system service feels great, plus I don't have to learn some extra orchestration layer to get them to work together or depend on non-container resources. I can just write the same systemd units I'm already writing. The auto-updating and service restart/notify on failure/etc is just icing on the cake. I've seen the equivalent Docker versions before and they're awful; giant messy run commands to try to work around the Docker daemon and half the time you end up with phantom services and containers anyway. Quadlet's end up being much cleaner; plus it means your whole setup (besides volume contents) exists with your other systemd units (/etc/systemd/, .config/systemd, /usr/local/lib/systemd, etc) so it's easy for backups.The only downside is they're not really an answer to docker-compose on the local development side and the podman team doesn't seem super interested in tackling that segment. User containers are nice for long running local test infra (i.e. a background database) but are too clunky for a normal compile-&gt; docker compose up -&gt; test -&gt; docker compose down loop. The best answer is either .kube Quadlets (kubernetes plays) or using docker compose [0] against the podman socket.Either way, I've enjoyed using quadlets enough that I've spent the last few months writing a gitops tool for managing them in my spare time. They just feel like the right way of managing containerized servers.[0] NOT podman-compose, which the article points out as being not very good and under-developed. Podman implements most of the compose spec so you can use docker compose for most situations. I suspect many people who tried Podman when RH first started pushing it ran into Podman 3 being kinda of bleh and podman-compose being awful and bounced off it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently discovered them and made an entire homelab based on the atomic OS and rootless Quadlets, can highly recommend them. They also allow to use systemd socket activation. Which means you can create systemd http/https sockets for example and activate Traefik automatically just like ssh.socket and podman.socket activates sshd.service and podman.service accordingly. It's a lifesaver since this is basically the only way to preserve source IP in rootless setups (rootless Podman/Docker usually doesn't easily allow to preserve source IP without major drawbacks).https://github.com/savely-krasovsky/homelab&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quadlet is a nice alternative for use-case of docker compose to "run all these interdependent containers in a production-like environment". I wish it (or something) was better about the other use-case of docker compose: development. docker compose will bring up the db, redis, opensearch, and other random dependencies, an nginx proxy, and a dev container with `.:/app` mounted as a volume. You can bring up all those containers together, destroy them together, check in the docker-compose.yml file, etc...Quadlet wants me to have all the files in `~/.config/containers/systemd`, so they're really not isolated to the project any more, and not in a convenient place to be checked in and shared with other devs (who also have to be using podman). Most still use docker, its what's availabile on codespaces and other hosted dev envs.So we use docker compose, with a checked-in yaml file. I use podman, so I have to manually add `:Z` to all the volumes, but regular docker chokes on that. I wouldn't mind having an alternative to docker compose for development, but Quadlet doesn't seem like a good fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43456934</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are the achievements of the Wrights with the 1903 Flyer:1. First 3-axis flight controls2. First propellor theory that was twice the efficiency of other airscrews3. First aircraft engine that had twice the power/weight of other engines4. First design that used a wind tunnel to get an efficient wing shape5. First directed research and development program to identify the problems and solve them one by one, with the results culminating in the 1903 Flyer6. Properly documented everything with photographs, notebooks and witnesses7. The Flyer is hanging in a museum today, and exacting replicas have been built and flown exhibiting the same documented flight characteristics as the Flyer.If you look at other contenders, they were all lacking these points. For example, with the Wright propellor, engine, and airfoil their craft had an enormous advantage over other designs that were trial and error.All modern aircraft can trace their lineage back to the 1903 Flyer, and no other claimant. The others were all developmental dead ends.P.S. About the catapult thing - are airplanes launched from aircraft carriers not airplanes? Besides, the 1903 Flyer did not use a catapult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question "Who invented this?" is most often pointless, because the largest part of the invention is collective. Once the environment is ready, many people can invent on the shoulders of their predecessors.Without the Wright brothers and Santos Dumont, aviation might have been created a few years later, but, overall, the consequence would have been small.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact of who was first honestly does not matter: they were all amazing pioneers.Alberto Santos Dumont created the 'Demoiselle' ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos-Dumont_Demoiselle)Which was an amazing achievement for the time: It was (one of?) the first tail-plane configuration in the world. And also one of the first airplane to be mass produced.This configuration is still used on almost all commercial airplane today and differed from the "canard" configuration of the Wright's flyer.Even 120 years later, "La demoiselle" looks weirdly "modern" as an airplane configuration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43442588</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to remind everyone that El Capitan, Frontier and LUMI supercomputers are powered by AMD instinct cards.El Capitan is #1 in TOP500. Frontier is #2, LUMI is #8.ROCm development is probably mainly driven by the needs of these supercompuers' users currently.So, we're seeing the tip of the iceberg.Also ROCm packages continue to land on Debian, so there's more than meets the eye.Note: Search "AMD Instinct" at https://top500.org/lists/top500/list/2024/11/. There are way more systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I understand correctly, this library provides some Torch kernels customized for AMD hardware. Why haven't they just upstreamed them to PyTorch for better adoption? Also, they seem to demo usage with Torch default eager execution mode and not Torch JIT/TorchScript. Is this library compatible with TorchScript?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So to do an efficient MM on AMD you need to find every MM in the pytorch model and replace it with a call to this library? Seems like something that should've been fixed years ago.Also I assume nvidia does the same thing but it is still hilarious that this is how it workshttps://github.com/ROCm/aiter/blob/main/aiter/configs/bf16_t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451968</guid></item><item><title>7.

If you have any cool ideas please let me know, they might even make it into my talk!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Common Lisp, at least, it's pretty typical for the compiler or interpretter to have packages for interacting with its internals.  For example, `sb-c`, `sb-vm`, and `sb-ext` packages in SBCL; and the `ccl` package with Clozure Common Lisp, etc.That ability also shows up in the inspector - it's possible to inspect types, classes, functions, etc. and inspect the internal data structures the compiler uses to represent them.With SBCL it's even possible to modify the "virtual ops" the compiler uses, and emit assembly code that SBCL doesn't support out of the box.It's a really convenient feature, and it would be nice if to see other languages pick it up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't read any of the code to see how it compares, but this work reminds me of research from Nada Amin &amp; Tiark Rompf on "towers of interpreters", where a stack of meta-circular interpreters uses some explicit staging operations that make it possible to specialize for the interpreter code in a way that removes overhead.https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/rompf/papers/amin-popl18.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434010</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the role of a Vatican Latinist, focusing on the importance of Latin as a liturgical language and as a medium for theological discourse within the Church. It highlights the efforts of Latinists to revive and promote the use of Latin in both ecclesiastical and educational contexts, examining the challenges and cultural shifts that affect its status. The piece emphasizes the broader significance of Latin in preserving the Church's history and identity, suggesting that a deeper appreciation of this language can enrich the spiritual life of the faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've mentioned here that I got to study with him in his summer course the very last year it was held in Rome (when he got sick and ultimately came back to the U.S.).He was a really cool guy and teacher of some really cool students, many of whom are still teaching Latin with their own spins on it.This article was published in 2017, so it doesn't mention that Foster subsequently died in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been rebuilding the meagre Latin I picked up in college in the 80s and I’ve found late Latin to be a bit helpful for building confidence—Beeson’s Primer of Medieval Latin and the Vulgate Bible have been my primary texts of late. With the Vulgate, I’ve been painstakingly translating by hand every verse (I’m not as diligent as I should be so I’m only up to Genesis 17 despite a few years of doing this in fits and starts). With Beeson, I reached the point where by the time I got to the poetry section, I was relying much less on wiktionary (which is handy because you can find most words by their inflected forms rather than having to know the correct dictionary form). I doubt I’ll ever be fully fluent, but I’ve got a pretty solid reading knowledge these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:Father Reginald Foster has died - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25539292 - Dec 2020 (51 comments)The Vatican's Latinist - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14769758 - July 2017 (61 comments)The Vatican’s Latinist - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13789097 - March 2017 (23 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43457202</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big day for open source Chinese model releases - DeepSeek-v3-0324 came out today too, an updated version of DeepSeek v3 now under an MIT license (previously it was a custom DeepSeek license). https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/deepseek/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This model is available for MLX now, in various different sizes.I ran https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct... using uv (so no need to install libraries first) and https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm like this:  uv run --with 'numpy&lt;2' --with mlx-vlm \
    python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
      --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit \
      --max-tokens 1000 \
      --temperature 0.0 \
      --prompt "Describe this image." \
      --image Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png

That downloaded an ~18GB model and gave me a VERY impressive result, shown at the bottom here: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/qwen25-vl-32b/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We were using Llama vision 3.2 a few months back and were very frustrated with it (both in term of speed and results quality). Some day we were looking for alternatives on Hugging Face and eventually stumbled upon Qwen. The difference in accuracy and speed absolutely blew our mind. We ask it to find something in an image and we get a response in like half a second with a 4090 and it's most of the time correct. What's even more mind blowing is that when we ask it to extract any entity name from the image, and the entity name is truncated, it gives us the complete name without even having to ask for it (e.g. "Coca-C" is barely visible in the background, it will return "Coca-Cola" on its own). And it does it with entities not as well known as Coca-Cola, and with entities only known in some very specific regions too. Haven't looked back to Llama or any other vision models since we tried Qwen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464068</guid></item><item><title>11. 23andMe files for bankruptcy to sell itself</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/dna-testing-firm-23andme-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sell-itself-2025-03-24/</link><description>

She has been trying to take the company private for some time.- Last August, she proposed to buy all the outstanding shares at $8 per share. The board rejected. She installed a new board, and submitted her proposal again at $2.53 per share. The board rejected. She tried it a third time at $0.4 per share this month, and the board rejected.- Meanwhile 23andMe was losing $50M every quarter.So, unable to resolve the issue, the board choosed to enter into the bankruptcy process. I hope this relieves 23andMe from the corporate governance nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if you haven't personally used their service, if any close relatives have, they already have a sizable amount of information on your genome. They maintain the equivalent of "shadow profiles" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_profile)  as part of their data model for "ancestry" modeling purposes - for example inferring a paternal haplogroup based on data uploaded by genetic relatives.I can only hope at the end of the day their data doesn't end up in the wrong hands. It is their most valuable asset, and this is a way bigger deal than it seems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damn, on Friday, the California DoJ Attorney General issued a warning to consumers about their data:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey Hacker News,
I’m excited to share LangManus, an open-source project that’s all about community-driven AI automation. Built on the shoulders of amazing open-source work, LangManus combines language models with specialized tools to tackle tasks like web search, crawling, and Python code execution—while giving back to the community that inspires it.
At its core, LangManus uses a hierarchical multi-agent system, where a supervisor coordinates a team of specialized agents to handle complex workflows. It integrates with LLMs like Qwen and powers up with tools like Tavily for search and Jina for crawling. Plus, it comes with Docker support and a web UI to make interaction a breeze.
Want to see it in action? Check out the demo video: https://youtu.be/sZCHqrQBUGk. In it, LangManus calculates the influence index of DeepSeek R1 on HuggingFace using a fully automated plan—think web searches, data retrieval, and Python code crunching, all seamlessly tied together.
Here’s what makes LangManus stand out:
Multi-Agent Magic: A supervisor delegates tasks to agents like Researcher, Coder, and Browser for efficient execution.Tool Integration: Web search with Tavily, neural search with Jina, and Python REPL for coding on the fly.Ease of Use: Docker-ready and a web UI for quick setup and control.If you’re into AI automation, multi-agent systems, or just love contributing to open-source projects, swing by the GitHub repo: https://github.com/langmanus/langmanus. Dive into the code, play with the demo, or drop some feedback—we’d love to hear from you.
Join the community and let’s build something awesome together!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since "Manus" is a registered trademark, you should probably change the name as quickly as possible to avoid legal issues with the original trademark holder.
At the very least, you could remove the "M" to avoid directly copying it while still maintaining recognizability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should probably change the name, I thought it was associated with Manus usually projects like this will specifically have in the tag line “An Open Source alternative to X.”Other than that looks very cool, reading through the code now. A lot of these projects very heavily lean on Browser Use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434171</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like Delphi, along with maybe VB6 and WinForms, have been the pinnacle of easy UI development, and things have gone significantly downhill since then. Especially on the web side, where even a single view sometimes requires having multiple unrelated dependencies (packers, builders, transpilers, etc.), often implicitly-configured to produce output, in head-space. And due to this dependency hell, when porting a project like this to a new platform, or just getting it to run, a slight change in the environment silently breaks the build.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this applicable to:https://www.lazarus-ide.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really cool seeing you here Marco, as a teenager I got into Delphi and a part of that were your books (and some local Delphi forum).

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution and significance of history as a discipline, emphasizing the methodologies historians use to interpret past events and the impact of cultural and social contexts on historical narratives. It highlights the importance of critical thinking and analysis in historiography, urging students and scholars to engage with primary sources and different perspectives to understand the complexities of history. The text also underscores the role of history in shaping identity and informing contemporary societal issues, encouraging an appreciation for diverse historical interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If 39 pages is too much for you, there's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Whitecoat#Seventh-da..."""Over the course of the 19-year program, more than 2,300 U.S. Army soldiers, many of whom were trained medics, contributed to the Whitecoat experiments by allowing themselves to be infected with numerous different kinds of bacteria that were considered likely choices for a biological attack. While some volunteered immediately after basic training, for conscientious objectors at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas (before they began their medic training), the near certainty of being assigned as a combat medic in Vietnam helped some medics choose instead to remain in the United States with the Whitecoat program. The goal of the program was to determine dose response for these agents."""I attended an SDA high school and was a member of the church for a couple years in college (I dated an SDA woman). It was interesting that they had a ton of dentists, doctors, etc. and ran well-regarded medical schools, but also espoused young Earth creationism. They also were generally suspicious of government involvement in religion, with many worried about a "national Sunday law" and being disallowed from worshipping on Saturday. Conversely, this generally included a desire for religion not to get too involved in government, which I respected quite a lot.I never really believed, and left the church after breaking up, but I really miss the sense of community. Every Saturday I'd go to a service with a boring sermon but some _fantastic_ singing (the entire congregation could, and did, sing, and those walls rang with "Down By The River To Pray" in 4 part harmony), then have a vegetarian (albeit cheesy) potluck after, and then just chill at the beach with friends. Society would do well to adopt the sabbath as a cultural practice. The minister where I was seemed pretty chill with marriage equality - I remember he gave a sermon about marriage while people protested California's prop 8 outside and he pointed out how badly LGBT couple wanted marriage at the same time others took it for granted.I wonder if it's still like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny; unethical human experimentation during that period is often excused as "it was common practice at the time" (to "forget" to consult patients before enrolling them into experiments), and here we have people of the same period making sure to follow proper ethical procedures...(The same way that even at the time slavery was common - be it XIXth century or Antique Greece - there were already quite a lot of people revulsed by it...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a fascinating paper with a lot of interesting context, the mid-1900s were a different time for medical ethics.I grew up in the Adventist church and it's been wild seeing it drift so far from its original distinguishing stances.When I was a kid, I primarily went to Adventist schools. However, one year after my family moved there wasn't an Adventist school available. I went to a local evangelical school instead. It was a real eye-opener.The evangelical school had a program of outright child brain-washing about abortion that I'd never heard as an Adventist. As a fifth grader I was getting daily updates about the Supreme Court nomination battle over (disgaced Nixon lackey) Robert Bork, because as early as the eighties court packing was a core strategy for anti-choice movement. There was daily news about abortion protests they were running. When I went home and asked my parents about it, they told me as Adventists we had the bible's stance on abortion: the bible says nothing about abortion. Adventists hospitals even allowed abortions to be performed on prem since they had no doctrinal problem with it.Fast forward to now, a lot of Adventist members are loudly anti-choice, anti-vaccine (the church leadership had to post a very delicately worded statement about vaccines because they operate respectable medical schools, and had to please both the many facebook-addled cranks in their pews as well as the sane professionals in their medical school staff), generally indistinguishable from generic right-wing evangelicals. The Adventist core membership of today I have no doubt would've been mostly pro-slavery and definitely would have no qualms about shooting people in war.The paper talks about the church's effort to go from 'sect' (firm moral stances putting them at odds with the majority) to 'denomination' (compromising their morals to fit in), and the church of today I'd say has run as far away as they could from being a sect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43462882</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This could be overgeneralising a bit... but I see a lot of people with ADHD (on- and offline) who tend to make it an essential part of their identity. I realise it's a very impactful thing to have to deal with (I have ADHD too) but I feel like a lot of the time it's brought up for no real reason.
E.g. you started daydreaming when reading a book? Forgot something to do when you walked through a doorway? Got angry? You lost track of what you were thinking about? Must be the ADHD.
There are YouTube channels whose whole gimmick is that they're run by and for people with ADHD. And guess what kind of content you'll see there: "Why cooking with ADHD is hell", "How ADHD can make you lie", "Music for people with ADHD". What happened to "music for concentration"?
HN is a place where I see this play out a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've ADHD and I'm on the spectrum. Others may differ - it's a spectrum after all-  but I feel no list-only app will ever silence the drunk baboon on my shoulder constantly pulling my attention from what I'm doing.I'd advise goblin.tools to market itself differently and aim for the neurotypical market as well.#my2cents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; goblin.tools is written and maintained by Bram De Buyser, an AI, software and data engineer.I'm not saying that a semicolon and an Oxford comma are _necessary_, here - but I am saying that I did a double-take at my first interpretation that we are now naming and personifying AIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461375</guid></item><item><title>17.

I've read biographies of Rickover and not all people who lived through this time are complementary.It's certainly true the strategic arms processes and nuclear submarine engineering benefited in a long term view.I just find myself asking if the US army recruiting tag line Be The Best You Can Be was really met, or if Rickover achieved what might be more akin to crystallography "local optimum" where there are better peaks out there, but this one is mine. (To borrow another army concept)Viewed from Australia the current state of US submarine construction is woeful. We're on the brink of being ripped off having prepaid for access to Virginia class subs soon, and AUKUS subs in future. We expect to be told we cannot have Virginia class subs ever, we cannot have longterm crewing or command ever, but we can host them retained in US HANDS and we can continue to pay for them.Not that Rickover made that happen,  but whatever his lessons are, the US submarine building industry doesn't seem to have learned then, or be able to apply them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was talking to someone who worked at McKinsey and they told me about the pains that the consulting group took to assure everyone that they were the "best and the brightest." That everyone working there was brilliant — assuredly. And they'd stand around, gassing each other up and sharing these stats... "Top 3% of their graduating class!!!"If you've watched Game of Thrones (before it lost the plot), you might be aware of the moment where one of the characters turns around to a petulant, teen tyrant-king and says, "Any man who must say, 'I am the King,' is no true king." I think that statement rings true for McKinsey and the obsession a lot of companies have with "hiring the best."Admiral Rickover was a true king; i.e., the opposite. He didn't hire the "best." No, he hired people with extraordinary potential and then worked with them to develop their potential.The theater with the chair and his hiring practises were filters to find people with agency whom he could teach how to be capable and smart. I wonder what the modern equivalent is today.Side note, almost exactly a year ago (~51 weeks), I edited together a video of him talking about how there aren't any extraordinary people waiting to be hired; https://x.com/1517fund/status/1775253578916974606&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author of Chinatalk post here!If you want to read the full write-up of the story of Rickover and the USS Nautilus, you can find my original substack here: https://charlesyang.substack.com/p/how-hyman-rickover-built-...I'm also planning on doing some archival research through the Rickover Files at US Naval Academy Archives, so if there are particular topics that are of interest about Rickover's legacy, let me know! Currently planning on prioritizing congressional testimony and unpublished memos or speeches that he gave.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450884</guid></item><item><title>20. 600M years of shared environmental stress response found in algae and plants</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-03-million-years-environmental-stress-response.html</link><description>

He was an Assyrian. Not many (any, ever?) "Arabs" go around sporting an ancient Iranian name for God (Hormuzd) for their first name, though it is interesting how that name somehow got adopted by the Chaldean Christian Assyrian community. And based on his bio on wikipedia, it appears his mother was in fact from a Jewish family since her father's name was Isaak Halabee (which is the Arabized variant of יצחק חליבה).One expects more from a magazine published by the Smithsonian, and rather ironic in an article about ancient languages of that region.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormuzd_Rassam#Early_lifehttps://www.uncomfortableoxford.com/unburying-an-archaeologi...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishak_Haleva - not his grandfather but the same exact name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you decipher writing?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/kgtlw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a PhD in neuroscience, where I studied circadian rhythm disruption and its effect on pain behavior. So I feel qualified to discuss this.In humans, pain has two primary components [0]:1. The sensory-discriminative component: where on my body, what type (hot? cold? chemical?), and how intense is the noxious stimulus?2. The affective-emotional component: how much does the pain hurt, and how does it affect emotional state?Very importantly, both #1 and #2 are considered “pain”, and they can be experienced both simultaneously and independently. Pain is entirely subjective, as TFA highlights.It does sound valuable to search for biomarkers of the sensory-discriminative component. But I’m doubtful that biomarkers for #2 are readily observable, beyond fMRI. The “Nociometer” may capture this, but what if it doesn’t in a reliable way, since it’s designed to test #1? TFA discussed how this could save money for health-care system money; this gives me an awful feeling.Relying on “biomarker-based pain measurements” worries me that patients who are primarily experiencing affective-emotional components of pain will only further be doubted or not trusted by physicians.There are already far, far too many examples of physicians not trust patients about pain. Re: women at Yale undergoing IVF treatments without fentanyl injections due to a drug misusing nurse stealing the fentanyl. Physicians responded to the unanesthetized women in excruciating pain by saying, “maybe you are immune to fentanyl!” [1*].I think we should tread lightly.—[0] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6676053/[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/health/yale-ivf-egg-retri...*There is a heart breaking podcast on this scandal, which is how I originally learned about it [2]. Of course when I was in horror telling my wife about the story, the news came as no surprise to her, as she’s experienced pain disbelief from physicians her entire life.[2] https://www.thisamericanlife.org/804/the-retrievals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been interested in pain and pain management since having a drunk driver crash into us. I've even moderated a panel of doctors who specialized in pain.How people deal with acute vs chronic pain can be very different. One doctor blew my mind when he described chronic pain as a spousal relationship. It's something you have to live with and work with. You can't ignore or bully pain.Also men and women deal with pain differently. Most men describe a heart attack as the worst pain ever. Many women have ignored heart attacks because it wasn't as bad as their period pains. Women also describe kidney stones as worse than childbirth.I had a friend go in to the doctor and described the pain as a 5. But the doctor noticed they were sweating because of pain, which made it at least a 7 in their experience as that was an involuntary physical response.I've been to places not described on the pain scale, when I was recovering from surgery the IV drop ran out, the pain was so bad my spirit phased out of my body slightly so I was less aware of the pain but could still see the nurse running around trying to load another bag into the IV dispenser.I can tell when a bad storm is coming because it feels like water running down the inside of my leg bone, like runoff down a gutter. 
Some days the pain is dull and I can get irritated easily, but some over the counter pain medications are helpful. So if I am going to the doctor I've already exhausted the available options, so pain is high priority to me as I can't do things.I have also noticed that men's pain is taken more seriously than women's pain. Redheads get less pain relief and if you are person of color, especially a female, doctors take your pain least seriously. It makes me wonder how they actually teach in med school for that to happen.Describing the pain in terms of what work I can and cannot do gets more attention than anything else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43457699</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No idea about mruby/C or picoruby but MicroPython is very popular, enough that I'd just settle on it for devices can handle it.  It runs nicely in 256k of flash and 32k of ram, on the small adafruit trinket devices.  It was shoehorned into the v1 BBC microbit which had 256k of flash and just 16k of ram, but that was apparently painful.Smaller include Lua and maybe Hedgehog Lisp.  Below that there is ulisp but that is sort of a toy.  Also there is Javacard and J2ME depending on device size.Below that you're probably best off forgoing garbage collection and using Forth or a cross compiled language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will have to look closer at picoruby. I do love MicroPython development. One support thing is how easy it is to combine with C, because to get the most out of microcontroller devices one really needs to use low-level languages from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;picoruby is a lot of fun. It's a reimplementation of mruby/c which is even smaller. You might be interested in my friend and creator HASUMI Hitoshi's presentation. He shows off his Ruby REPL that runs on the Raspberry Pi pico.
Recently he ported picoruby to other microcontrollers.https://youtu.be/WxZNE5zTAjg?si=7DQUcQg80RMZoU0b&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451760</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This project looks like a very nice lightweight way to implement policy in a Rust application; I really like the ergonomics of the builder. Despite being very different systems, the core permissions check being the same signature as a call to SpiceDB[0] (e.g. the subject, action, resource, and context) shows the beauty of the authorization problem-domain regardless of the implementation.I would like to add some color that a policy engine is not all you need to implement authorization for your applications. Without data, there's nothing for a policy engine to execute a policy against and not all data is going to be conveniently in the request context to pass along. I'd like to see more policy engines take stances on how their users should get that data to their applications to improve the DX. Without doing so, you get the OPA[1] ecosystem where there are bunch of implementations filling the gap as an afterthought, which is great, but doesn't give a first-class experience.[0] https://spicedb.io[1] https://openpolicyagent.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;command-f "license" :-(I do see &lt;https://github.com/thepartly/gatehouse/blob/v0.1.2/Cargo.tom...&gt; but my experience with package manager license declaration is that it is almost always "yeah, yeah, default, whatever" versus an explicit choice. They are also invisible to the GitHub license widget, which places the burden upon the user to go spelunking around in the code to know for sure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the advantage of having the policy checking be an async function? From a brief look (framework itself and one of the examples provided in the examples directory) it seems that you’d typically be doing all I/O operations up front before invoking the policy checker, and that doing the policy check does not itself involve any I/O.I only looked over the code quickly so I’m probably overlooking something.It would be neat to get the motivation for each of the functions that are async being async instead of just “normal” functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43466221</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Europeans were perfectly happy to buy American tech und military exports, thus earning U.S. money and making EU technologically and politically dependent from the U.S. - it really was perfect for the U.S. But the US decided that it was actually a BAD DEAL and they wanted to extort even more money and dependence from EU. So now EU is investing in their own tech and military, thus reducing the amount of money US is getting and also reducing EU's dependency on the US, thus forcing EU to invest in their own tech &amp; military, thus becoming a competitor to the US products. Your boy trump did do deliver, is the US now GREAT enough for you yet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At my (enterprise) job there has been a noticable shift in attitude.We've just decided to use Mistral for OCR, even though everything we currently use is embedded in Azure / IntelDocs or something.Usually any push for EU products would be dismissed because of the initial friction compared to SV products. This seems to have shifted significantly all the way to the top. Everyone seems on board to just accept more friction to use EU products.We are now even moving to a non-AWS/Azure K8s cluster. This was unheard of even a few months ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is not only about a US-boycott for me, but also about an increase in consciousness about how our choices _do_ have influence. It _does_ matter, which products I buy and I use.I hope this gains more momentum!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43458509</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the transition from CommonJS to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) in the JavaScript ecosystem, highlighting the benefits of using ESM, such as improved tree-shaking, native support in browsers, and better compatibility with modern tooling. The author outlines the challenges developers may face during this shift, particularly with existing codebases and package dependencies that still rely on CommonJS. The article encourages developers to adopt ESM and provides practical guidance and insights on how to manage this transition effectively, emphasizing that embracing ESM will lead to more efficient and future-proof projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They key thing is that require(esm) shipped in node 22, and is being back ported to node 20.Since Node 18 maintenance ends in less than a month, this means all Node versions will have good esm support, including for consuming esm-only libraries (which until recently did not work!)This is noted somewhat in the article, but basically is the whole story to me. Its now possible to stop doing CJS libraries entirely. And with that, I don't see why we would do CJS at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, oddly no mention of native browser support in the form of &lt;script type=“module”&gt;  and importmaps! To me, that felt like the last platform to offer ESM support.I also feel like browser support “feels” more official than support from bundlers.Just weird to leave out a mention of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was working on a legacy CSJ project, and I tried to upgrade an OIDC library, but the newer version would only work with ESM. I decided to use that as an excuse to migrate our project to ESM. However, I hit a bug using dd-trace with ESM. Over a year later, that bug hasn't been resolved. I try to use ESM as much as possible for new projects, but it's not always simple to migrate existing projects to ESM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43456966</guid></item><item><title>34.

I.e. simultaneously surveying the entire sky and tracking all aircraft in flight? This could allow finding downed aircraft much more quickly. Would a megaconstellation like starlink with cameras suffice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They should look into how this can be combined with established radar-based aircraft tracking techniques, e.g. Kalman filtering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TFA doesn't really explain how is this better/cheaper than existing ADSB based technologies, or where one is more appropriate than the other (ie which use cases it's targeting)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43465189</guid></item><item><title>35.

I could even give your players a little travel money for games ..."- My father says, "what do we have to do...?"- Mafia guy says, "We'd like you to apply to the State of Massachusetts and declare your team to be a non-profit organization. Once you're a non-profit, Massachusetts will allow you to run a 'las vegas gambling night' fundraiser twice per year. I would run those fundraisers for you."- My father didn't exactly understand the scam, but he politely declined and that was that.In retrospect, it was pretty obvious that the guy wanted to launder money through the soccer team and the Las Vegas Night fundraiser was the 'vehicle' to cleanse the dirty money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This doesn't really detail any money laundering scheme. This is just how to access scammed money. Simply cashing out a large deposit of tether isn't laundering money.  You still need a legitimate way to explain how you earned the money for it to be considered laundered.Although I'm not sure it matters in Cambodia, for 3rd world country scammers the challenge is just getting the money at all.In my area people launder through AirBnb. Put a nice listing up, then have a 3rd party "rent" it with cash purchased AirBnB gift cards. You get a very clean 10-99.AirBnb does minimal validation on guests, and their gift cards are "closed loop" so no AML / KYC regulations at the grocery store.Not much incentive to stop it, AirBnB and state / local governments all get a nice cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43454411</guid></item><item><title>37.

I installed it on my deck and it was full of bugs, the ISO image size is the biggest I have ever seen (~10G), KDE crashes way too often, invoking keyboard doesn't work half the time, comes with so much bloat (waydroid being one of them). It's a joke to even call it a better "experience".Also, immutability absolutely sucks for daily drive. I have to wait for 10mins for rpm-ostree to install a package while a normal distro can do it in seconds. Immutability makes sense in case of routers, VMs running core services (such as a reverse proxy, dns, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Simple, right? This copies a file to run a Nginx container as a quadlet and a config into the /etc folder. This brings GitOps to my OS. With this whenever my machine starts, whether for the first time or millionth time, its going to be configured to work exactly as expected with no extra work or additional configuration.That isn't GitOps. That's immutable file systems. Make it as immutable as you want, that has nothing to do with GitOps. You need the other half of the story, the infrastructure-as-code and the deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There is no denying that most applications are shipped today as a Docker container and most developers have some experience with themAuthor and I move in quite different circles.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a controversial incident involving Hobby Lobby, a craft store chain, which purchased ancient artifacts that were later found to have been illegally smuggled from Iraq. The author details the subsequent investigations that revealed the company's questionable acquisition practices, leading to legal repercussions, including a hefty fine. The piece examines the broader implications of the situation regarding cultural heritage, ethical collecting practices, and the responsibilities of corporations in preserving history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish the author was a little less over-wrought in her descriptions of the Green family's religious commitments. I've heard complaints before about the Green's artifact acquisition process, and they've had to return some manuscripts: it's a story worth investigating and telling. But it distracts from the author's main point when she's making snide comments about their faith. Yes, they're Christians who are successful at business and who take their faith seriously - so? If the author is trying to convince people she's an even-handed reporter, she'd do better to drop the sarcastic tone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time I've shopped at a Hobby Lobby, I've gotten a weird feeling that there's something else shady going on. They don't use barcodes to price any of the goods. Everything has a sticker on it, and the cashier types up everything by hand. Your receipt ends up just being a list of dollar amounts and a total, nothing identifying your purchases in any way.I just assumed that they're doing this so they can falsify audits. Similar to how they purchase land and donate it, claiming a bigger tax write-off, I assume they're doing the same with their merchandise. How could you audit it if there's no real stock tracking system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many upvotes here due to the political/religious aspect, but there should be some comment on the archeological issue. From what I've gathered in the past, the main points are:1. An organization with very deep pockets sets out to collect Near Eastern antiquities.2. Due to turmoil in the Middle East, many relics of dubious provenance are hitting the market.3. The org decides to buy as much of this stuff as they can, knowing that some of it will be dubious.4. The org voluntarily has their purchases inspected, knowing they will not be compensated for things that have to be returned to their rightful places.In outline, this sounds like the buyers doing the right thing in a bad situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451207</guid></item><item><title>39. 63 Chinese Cuisines: The Complete Guide (2024)</title><link>https://chinesecookingdemystified.substack.com/p/63-chinese-cuisines-the-complete</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One country, one cuisine.A professor whose research focused on China (social sciences, not food) told me that Americans also tend to imagine China as similar to the US - one large country. They said it was more like Europe, if Europe was all one federal country - different languages, different cultures, different cuisines, etc.Holding China together has long been a preoccupation of imperial government. You can see the current regime gradually working to do that, from defeating the Nationalists finally in 1949, and trying to bring into the fold Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, .... For decades, the People's Liberation Army's main focus was internal, on its own people as in many dictatorships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, food in China can be so hyperlocal that I thought surely this won’t include stuff that’s not know outside China, like Guilin Noodles, but its there just under a different name than what I expected.In particular, going to Hangzhou and trying the food there opened my eyes to how varied Chinese food is. There were a lot of lightly cooked vegetables and thinly sliced meats with subtle flavoring and sauces, the opposite of what I thought of saucy heavily cooked stir fry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait, where is General Tso's Chicken?My wife is from a small town just 50 km southeast of Nanjing, that is now folded into Nanjing proper, with metro and all. The town's language has nothing to do with Nanjing, they cannot understand each other at all. The town's cuisine is completely different, there's no duck at all, no similarities besides focus on rice as a staple.I applaud the author of the article. Living and traveling China for 13 years drove me to understand that, to me, there's really no "X Chinese Cuisines", every little town has something unique and some cooking methods that are totally different from the next little town. Same with the language.It's a shame that it's now being destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43457180</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "Cottagecore Programmers," a term that blends the romanticized rural aesthetic of cottagecore with the modern profession of programming. It explores how this subculture embraces a slower, more intentional lifestyle, prioritizing simplicity, sustainability, and creativity in their work. The author highlights the desire for connection with nature and traditional crafts, suggesting that these values can influence the technology industry by promoting a balance between digital life and the natural world.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh hey, I'm the guy who (in?)famously no longer builds software. Still building furniture, still dicking around on HN when I'm not building furniture.My current project is a mid-century modern-inspired dining table. I'm delighted by the design, and I'm tickled to be building it. Not all projects are as fun. Last year I built a very large liquor cabinet that involved rather more problem-solving than expected. I should've charged more for it, and I am, as ever, grateful that my partner works a salaried job that comes with health insurance.As a small point of order, I was never actually asked to add an RSS feed to a DBMS. I've definitely implemented things that made just as much sense to me though.I remain delighted by how much that GitHub comment still resonates with folks, and I remain astonished that the issue is still open after almost 8 years.ETA: I remain wholly unqualified to discuss the state of actual agriculture and homesteading. My partner and I garden, but make no pretense of ever having our small home be self-sustaining economically or even in food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having spent my youth on a dryland wheat farm in Montana, I would just say no.Why does everyone who sits behind a computer long to be out in the fields or workshops?My flip answer to that is that they haven't spent their youth on a farm, worrying about a hailstorm that wipes out the entire wheat crop for the year, or you lose 25% of your cattle herd to a recently diagnosed virus diarrhea. My grandparents were homesteaders who at some point in their life lived in houses with dirt floors.The fact of life was that due to technology, the productivity of the American farm increased by almost two orders of magnitude during my Grandfather's lifetime.  This meant that a tractor that my dad purchased when I was about 3 for the equivalent of 1500 bushels of wheat cost about 9000 by the time I went to college.Thus, the economics of a family farm, or sole dude wanting to get away from the computer and grow something is painful.A couple of kids that do an excellent job of building a homestead are the couple behind the youtube channel Ambition Strikes.  They call at an off-grid homestead, but through their unbounded energy and creativity have created their own substantial mini-grid. I have a lot of respect for them and what they have done.The article notes It is difficult to think of any field more forcibly disentangled from any sort of understanding of the impact of your labor than the majority of positions in tech.  This is discussed in some detail in the book "Stiffed" by Susan Faludi. She discusses the community nature of the naval shipyards, in which everyone apparently was connected meaningfully to their work and the workers around them. She contrasts that with the workers in aerospace whose work is so abstract that it was hard for a professional working there to describe to their kids what exactly they do all day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grey hair sysadmin story time...I came to understand the "purposelessness" of my career very early on; when I decommissioned a bare metal server from a datacenter after finishing the deploy of it's replacement and realised that the old server was the first unit I'd racked when I started in the position 4 years ago.That was ~20 years ago. Nothing I've had a hand in building / maintaining has "survived" for more than ~7 years.My Dad worked to build houses. Prior to my IT career I'd laboured for him and played my small part in the creation of many homes around where I grew up. They'll be there for a hundred years maybe.Quitting the ephemeral world of IT to work on building a homestead and creating tangible things that directly keep humans alive seems like an obvious calling to me.The constant evolution of "tech" is a blessing and a curse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464914</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So their argument is that the tests are not providing causal inference, because the platforms can target the two A/B test groups differently.With that in mind, my reading of this is: if you're a researcher trying to say "Advertisement A is more appealing than Y", you need causal inference and these tests won't give them to you. If you're a marketer just trying to determine what ad spend is more efficient, you don't need that causal inference.In other words, they are debunking using these tools for research studies, and not as marketing tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really found this paper interesting and concerning. I don’t work in marketing or run these kinds of studies. I do work at Qualtrics and have experience with A/B testing, in general. For those who work in this space and can relate to this paper, would it be helpful if Qualtrics developed some kind of audit panel in our product to help surface potential platform bias? For example, sample ratio mismatch or metadata balance checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;i.e., the inability to attribute user responses to ad creatives versus the platform’s targeting algorithmsWhy would people expect to measure just the creative? How good the platform is able to target is part of what one would want to include in the measurement.The goal of these experiments is to see which creative pushes the metrics the most.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43457483</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;HP has reached a class-action settlement regarding issues with certain printer models that became non-functional, or "bricked," after users attempted to use third-party ink cartridges. The settlement allows HP to avoid paying monetary damages, but it includes provisions for offering affected customers a solution, which could involve benefits like discounts on future purchases or compensation in the form of vouchers. The case highlighted concerns around consumer rights, ensuring that users retain the ability to use third-party products without negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it sounds like HP pays nothing to the people they hurt, they don't have to admit to doing anything wrong, and they get to continue to kill printers using forced updates as long as they aren't one of 21 specific models, and even for those 21 models they can still kill them using updates as long as they don't call the update a "Dynamic Security feature"?This is exactly the kind of bullshit "win" that makes class-action lawsuits a total joke for anyone looking for justice, and why corporations continue to engage in user-hostile behavior. They stand to make a lot more money screwing over consumers than they have to fear from lawsuits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the upside you can now decline firmware upgrades that try to prevent you from using 3rd party ink, aka: Dynamic Security.But only on certain models.Yeah, they totally got away with it.… HP has agreed to continue making certain disclosures to users of Class Printers about Dynamic Security and data collection, and to continue to allow users of Class Printers to either agree to install or decline to install firmware updates that include Dynamic Security features. The disclosures that HP has agreed to continue making include the disclosure that HP collects printer cartridge data from Class Printers through the HP Smart App, and that HP’s Dynamic Security measures are designed to block cartridges using a non-HP chip, and may be delivered to printers through periodic firmware updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The obvious solution for consumers --- don't buy HP printers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43458759</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for building and publishing games directly to Steam using GitHub Actions, a continuous integration and deployment tool. It outlines the steps required to automate the process, including setting up a GitHub repository, configuring the necessary credentials, and creating workflows that compile the game and publish it to Steam. The author emphasizes the advantages of automation, such as saving time and reducing human error, and provides insights into troubleshooting common issues that may arise during the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope there is an author of the post. I appreciate sharing this example.However, there is a caveat regarding the workflow code itself, that placing "run" statement with specific commands directly in YAML may make it difficult to debug locally. I would recommend that "run" statements be only for script execution and their number minimized. This way, scripts can be run locally without waiting for the entire CI pipeline to execute each time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This doesn't really say much about publishing games from GitHub Actions. There's about 3 lines that reference https://github.com/game-ci/steam-deploy which contains the actual implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you deal with Steam Guard code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43453059</guid></item><item><title>47.

No content whatsoever can be browsed (yet).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone confused, this isn't a EU based archiving service like the main Internet Archive. It's a vaguely worded plan of "tools" and "collections", whatever that means.Their BlueSky profile pretty much sums up the program:&gt; Internet Archive Europe, a Dutch non-profit research library, is building collections and tools to bring them to life. Working with libraries, museums, and archives, we share these tools and collections to further everyone’s services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464230</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians at MIT have developed a model to understand and predict crowd movement, revealing insights into the collective behavior of people walking together. Using mathematical tools, they analyzed how individuals adjust their paths based on the positions and movements of those around them. The research aims to enhance safety and efficiency in crowded environments, such as public transportation and emergency evacuations, by providing a better understanding of pedestrian dynamics. The findings underscore the complexity of social interactions and the underlying logic of crowd behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A "lane" requires people to simply walk behind someone else. Even if everyone is going in the same direction (or else the opposite one), staying in a lane requires patience. When some people are in great hurry compared to others, they start to look for ways of getting around their lane predecessor, disrupting the lanes. People not in a hurry will prefer to follow someone going the same way, because that person shields them from having to awkwardly dodge oncomers left or right. Either that person handles it directly, or else their own predecessor, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's curious how Man does these things naturally, but needs many man-years of studies and experimentation to arrive at gross approximations of how we function.All the logic of how we move in crowds is in our brains, we apply it every day. Yet we don't know it explicitly. Something that we do consciously, even.But, in this case, it's rather emergent behaviour that's pointed out. We know how we behave how the person in front of us steps out of line: we move to the side ourselves or slow down. What's less obvious is when and how this cascades onto the whole crowd.I don't know exactly what their physical analogies with fluid dynamics are, but this sounds like turbulence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have we uncovered how crowds swarm digital content? It feels like these hidden algorithms trapped away inside Meta probably have the answer as well. Those would be meaningful research papers from Meta if they were ever to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43465256</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; my husband Tyler and I wanted that sense of community that feels like it’s only possible in the suburbs, but we believed we could achieve this while living in San Francisco.This genuinely threw me because in my experience the suburbs are the antithesis of this, just lots of people occupying neighboring space and rarely talking to each other.Still, a heartwarming story all the same. And yes, this is _exactly_ what city living should enable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm the co-author of Supernuclear and editor of this post. We've been writing the blog for almost five years now, you never know what will go viral!I've spent my adult life living in Istanbul, New York, San Francisco, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In Istanbul it sometimes felt like my neighbors knew too much about me - they would comment on who slept over (I had a lot of friends visit!) and once when I went out of town for a week my landlady said she nearly let herself into my home to make sure I hadn't died because no one had seen me in a few days. That being said, it was also comforting to know, 5000 miles from my home and my family, that people around me cared about my wellbeing and my whereabouts.And this is the thing those of us who live in the US sometimes forget: knowing your neighbors isn't just about being able to borrow cup of sugar when you're out. It's about knowing someone will share their generator when a hurricane has knocked your power out. It's about someone noticing when something looks off and coming over to knock and make sure you're ok. We aren't just happier when we get to know our neighbors better, we're safer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This rules. I want to do it, but I know I can't personally, because I'm not awake at the hour people normally want coffee. Maybe I can figure out stoop whiskey.Another thing that works for meeting and talking to your neighbors, and has the benefit of attaching you to people who live blocks away from you and not just the people you see getting into the car every morning, is local politics. I've met more people being engaged in local politics than I have through any other activity, including work.My guess is that civic engagement across the United States works pretty much the way it does where I live in Chicagoland, which is that somewhere there is a message board, Facebook group, or mailing list, and you get engaged by joining it, getting the vibe, and then participating in the discussion --- it's very much (alarmingly much) like getting comfortable on Hacker News. Except you do it well and you can change laws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43473618</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the biggest problems with hands off LLM writing (for long horizon stuff like novels) is that you can't really give them any details of your story because they get absolutely neurotic with it.Imagine for instance you give the LLM the profile of the love interest for your epic fantasy, it will almost always have the main character meeting them within 3 pages (usually page 1) which is of course absolutely nonsensical pacing. No attempt to tell it otherwise changes anything.This is the first model that after 19 pages generated so far resembles anything like normal pacing even with a TON of details. I've never felt the need to generate anywhere near this much. Extremely impressed.Edit: Sharing it - https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts?state=%7B%22ids%22:%...with pastebin - https://pastebin.com/aiWuYcrF&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using a math puzzle as a way to benchmark the different models. The math puzzle took me ~3 days to solve with a computer. A math major I know took about a day to solve it by hand.Gemini 2.5 is the first model I tested that was able to solve it and it one-shotted it. I think it's not an exaggeration to say LLMs are now better than 95+% of the population at mathematical reasoning.For those curious the riddle is: There's three people in a circle. Each person has a positive integer floating above their heads, such that each person can see the other two numbers but not his own. The sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third. The first person is asked for his number, and he says that he doesn't know. The second person is asked for his number, and he says that he doesn't know. The third person is asked for his number, and he says that he doesn't know. Then, the first person is asked for his number again, and he says: 65. What is the product of the three numbers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm impressed by this one. I tried it on audio transcription with timestamps and speaker identification (over a 10 minute MP3) and drawing bounding boxes around creatures in a complex photograph and it did extremely well on both of those.Plus it drew me a very decent pelican riding a bicycle.Notes here: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43473489</guid></item><item><title>4. 4o Image Generation</title><link>https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's important about this new type of image generation that's happening with tokens rather than with diffusion, is that this is effectively reasoning in pixel space.Example: Ask it to draw a notepad with an empty tic-tac-toe, then tell it to make the first move, then you make a move, and so on.You can also do very impressive information-conserving translations, such as changing the drawing style, but also stuff like "change day to night", or "put a hat on him", and so forth.I get the feeling these models are quite restricted in resolution, and that more work in this space will let us do really wild things such as ask a model to create an app step by step first completely in images, essentially designing the whole app with text and all, then writing the code to reproduce it. And it also means that a model can take over from a really good diffusion model, so even if the original generations are not good, it can continue "reasoning" on an external image.Finally, once these models become faster, you can imagine a truly generative UI, where the model produces the next frame of the app you are using based on events sent to the LLM (which can do all the normal things like using tools, thinking, etc). However, I also believe that diffusion models can do some of this, in a much faster way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ran through some of my relatively complex prompts combined with using pure text prompts as the de-facto means of making adjustments to the images (in contrast to using something like img2img / inpainting / etc.)https://mordenstar.com/blog/chatgpt-4o-imagesIt's definitely impressive though once again fell flat on the ability to render a 9-pointed star.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I wasn’t able to generate the image because the combination of abstract elements and stylistic blending [...] may have triggered content filters related to ambiguous or intense visuals.nah. i pass and stick with midjourney.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43474112</guid></item><item><title>5.

I hope this does not happen, because this is death to entrepreneurship, this is one of those things that will poison the economy, when people no longer trust that what they make can be theirs, that others can look on in envy at the work they have built on their blood and sweat and can take it as their due because they have power.That will create a chilling effect for anyone who wishes to create and will make them wonder as myself and many others have considered, whether it's better to create their life's work elsewhere.I sincerely hope this doesn't happen here, once this mindset becomes a norm, it's incredibly hard thing to stamp out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43462783</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent advancements in the use of Newton polynomials, a mathematical tool developed by Isaac Newton over 300 years ago, which are now being updated with modern techniques. Researchers have enhanced these polynomials to improve their application in various fields such as approximation theory and numerical analysis. This modernization allows for greater efficiency and accuracy in solving complex problems, reflecting how foundational concepts in mathematics can evolve with new methodologies and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the paper[1], they note that their method seems much more well-behaved for multi-variate problems. In the case they numerically examined, the regular Newton's method had a fractal pattern of which starting points converged, while their method had a nice contiguous area with fairly sharp boundary.That is, if using Newton's method one could start close to the solution but still not converge, while their method seems much more well-behaved.I guess that might be a more attractive property than "just" being faster. However not an expert so not sure if other, cheaper alternatives also has this property.That said, the whole point of their method is to use higher-order derivatives. Admittedly I don't do optimization problems that often, but when I do my function is seldom analytical, and so getting good higher-order derivatives are usually expensive at best and problematic at worst.They do touch on this in the section about future work, wondering if a quasi-Newton method[2] could be created in a similar vein, using only sparse sampling of the higher-order derivatives.[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06374[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Newton_method&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I had my Gell-Mann effect moment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_amnesia_effect)The illustration of the Newton method is wrong, isn't it? The approximating second order polynomials that were drawn are not really graphs of second order polynomials, they are not even functions... those are parables in the 2D plane, but Newton's method won't work like that... Besides, the convexity of the target function looks negative near to the first guess, the Newton method shall probably miserably fail here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent way too long figuring this one out, so this is what I got:An improvement on [1], which I vaguely remember using with pen and paper to find minimums of differentiable functions. The original algorithm runs "on a loop" (iteratively) and utilizes the first and second order derivative of a function (f', f''). From the article:&gt; Newton did it for degree 2. He did that because nobody knew how to minimize higher-order polynomialsThe improved version looks a lot more complex but seems to sacrifice simplicity to converge faster to the minimum when implemented as a program.Trivia: a "single loop" of the Newthon method is famously used in Quake's Fast InvSqrt() implementation [2].--1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root#Newto...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43465971</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The VGG-T project, developed by Facebook Research, focuses on the implementation of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) deep learning models for various computer vision tasks. The repository provides code and tools for utilizing and training these models, emphasizing applications in image classification and feature extraction. It offers pre-trained weights, instructions for model training, and resources for data processing, aiming to facilitate research and development in the field of computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read the paper yesterday, would recommend it. Kudos to the authors for getting to these results, and also for presenting them in a polished way. It's nice to follow the arguments about the alternating attention (global across all tokens vs only the tokens per camera), the normalization (normalize the scene scale - done in the data vs DUST3R, which normalizes in the network), and the tokens (image tokens from DINOv2 + camera tokens + additional register tokens, handling the first camera differently as it becomes the frame of reference). The results are amazing, and fine-tuning this model will be fun, e.g. for forward 3DGS reconstruction, looking forward to this.I'm sure getting to this point was quite difficult, and on the project page you can read how it involved discussions with lots and lots of smart and capable people. But there's no big "aha" moment in the paper, so it feels like another hit for The Bitter Lesson in the end: They used a giant bunch of [data], a year and a half of GPU time to [train] the final model, and created a model with a billion parameters that outperforms all specialized previous models.Or in the words of the authors, from the paper:&gt; We also show that it is unnecessary to design a special network for 3D reconstruction. Instead, VGGT is based on a fairly standard large transformer [119], with no particular 3D or other inductive biases (except for alternating between frame-wise and global attention), but trained on a large number of publicly available datasets with 3D annotations.Fantastic to have this. But it feels.. yes, somewhat bitter.[The Bitter Lesson]: http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html (often discussed on HN)[data]: "Co3Dv2 [88], BlendMVS [146], DL3DV [69], MegaDepth [64], Kubric [41], WildRGB [135], ScanNet [18], HyperSim [89], Mapillary [71], Habitat [107], Replica [104], MVS-Synth [50], PointOdyssey [159], Virtual KITTI [7], Aria Synthetic Environments [82], Aria Digital Twin [82], and a synthetic dataset of artist-created assets similar to Objaverse [20]."[train]: "The training runs on 64 A100 GPUs over nine days", that would be around $18k on lambda labs in case you're wondering&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More info and demos:https://vgg-t.github.io/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish someone would take this and combine it with true photogrammetry to supplement the photogrammetry rather than just try to replace traditional photogrammetry.This type of thing would be the killer app for phone based 3d scanners.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study that reveals the effectiveness of World War I's "dazzle camouflage," which was designed to confuse enemy perception of naval ships. Researchers discovered that the camouflage created an unexpected optical illusion that distorted the actual size and speed of the vessels, leading observers to misjudge their trajectories. The study emphasizes the ingenuity of these designs in evading detection and highlights how the principles of optical deception in art can have practical applications in military strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't really get how the horizon effect is something that could be confused/conflated with the effect of dazzle camouflage.  The horizon effect is described as a predictable bias in angle estimation, relative to the true angle, when a ship is viewed such that it's near the horizon. This presumably always applies to the view from a periscope, so it would be ever present in any remotely reasonable test of dazzle camouflage (whether to a neutral control or to conventional camouflage patterns). They just say that Blodgett’s control was "too vague to be useful", but it would have to be a truly terrible control to lead to the suggested confusion, e.g., comparing dazzle camouflage through a periscope to conventional camouflage viewed from above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last photo in the article is of my great uncle's [0] ship, the Olympic [1], sister ship to the Titanic.

In more concrete terms, think of the stripe, heroku, and GitHub CLIs.It’s similar to SSH in that it streams stdio from the server to a thin-client, but that’s where the similarities end. It has additional commands, like open a browser to a URL and set “cookies” on the client terminal from the sever.When all of those commands are put together, you get something like https://github.com/terminalwire/demodx/blob/main/app/termina... that can open the users browser to an SSO, authorize the CLI, then set a token/nonce/whatever as a “cookie” in the users terminal so they can authenticate and run commands against the SaaS.My intention isn’t to replace SSH—it’s still the best protocol for a lot of things, but I have found it cumbersome to use it to build CLIs for SaaS, which is why I built Terminalwire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't love this.&gt; Unfortunately, while ID Tokens do include identity claims like name, organization, and email address, they do not include the user’s public key. This prevents them from being used to directly secure protocols like SSHThis seems like dubious statement. SSH authentication does not need to be key based.I understand the practicality of their approach, but I would have preferred this to be proper first-class authentication method instead of smuggling it through publickey auth method. SSH protocol is explicitly designed to support many different auth methods, so this does feel like a missed opportunity. I don't know openssh internals, but could this have been implemented through gssapi? That's the traditional route for ssh sso. If not gssapi, then something similar to it.https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4462&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470906</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;X Macros are a classic C++ pattern. Less known than some of the more popular techniques like curiously recurring template pattern, but still quite common in large codebases.(Although... it is a neat trick, but... It is kind of mostly useful because C++ macros are not very powerful. If they were more powerful, most uses of X Macros could be replaced by just having a single macro do all of the magic.)I recently saw something I hadn't seen before in a similar vein. There's a million different bin2c generators, and most of them will generate a declaration for you. However, I just saw a setup where the bin2c conversion just generates the actual byte array text, e.g. "0x00, 0x01, ..." so that you could #include it into whatever declaration you want. Of course, this is basically a poor man's #embed, but I found it intriguing nonetheless. (It's nice that programming languages have been adding file embedding as a first-class feature. This really simplifies a lot of stuff and removes the need to rely on more complex solutions for problems that don't really warrant them.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really more a C pattern than a C++ pattern, isn't it?Frustrated by C's limitations relative to Golang, last year I sketched out an approach to using X-macros to define VNC protocol message types as structs with automatically-generated serialization and deserialization code.  So for example you would define the VNC KeyEvent message as follows:    #define KeyEvent_fields(field, padding)               \
      field(u8, down_flag)                                \
      padding(u8)                                         \
      padding(u8)                                         \
      field(u32, keysym)

    MESSAGE_TYPE(KeyEvent)

And that would generate a KeyEvent typedef (to an anonymous struct type) and two functions named read_KeyEvent_big_endian and write_KeyEvent_big_endian.  (It wouldn't be difficult to add debug_print_KeyEvent.)  Since KeyEvent is a typedef, you can use it as a field type in other, larger structs just like u8 and u32.Note that here there are two Xes, and they are passed as parameters to the KeyEvent_fields macro rather than being globally defined and undefined over time.  To me this feels cleaner than the traditional way.The usage above is in http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/binmsg_cpp.c, MESSAGE_TYPE and its ilk are in http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/binmsg_cpp.h, and an alternative approach using Python instead of the C preprocessor to generate the required C is in http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/binmsg.py.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hate X-Macros, but they're very useful in some situations.  We use them to generate an enum of error values and also a string table of those names.  (Unlike two separate tables, the X macro version is guaranteed to be the exact correct length / values align with the corresponding string.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43472143</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;In the article, Jeff Geerling expresses his frustration with the trend of smart appliances, particularly dishwashers, that require cloud connectivity for operation. He argues that this reliance on the cloud can lead to privacy concerns, potential functionality issues if the service is disrupted, and unnecessary complexity in home appliances. Geerling emphasizes the importance of simplicity and reliability in household devices, stating he prefers appliances that can operate independently without internet dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bosch!I ran into the same situation. I specifically told the salesperson I didn't want wifi, and they told me it's only if you want it to operate from your phone.I was done installing it and got rid of the packaging by the time I read that it needs to use their website for some functions.Beside the fact that I doubt the store would take it back after using it for a week or two and havi go no packaging, I had no time nor energy to remove it and return it.I tried to contact Bosch who keep redirecting me to some other I ternal department and eventually stop responding.Do NOT buy a Bosch diswashe, even though you pay full price upfront you cannot use all the functions without creating an account on their website and have them run those functions for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel Jeff should have bit the bullet and just returned it. I know it's a waste of time, but these products have to be rejected at retail. Retailers will eventually get tired of the extra support burden and demand manufacturers drop stuff like this.They should all get hit with the open box problem from the returns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've learned when buying a full set of appliances couple of years ago: don't read consumer reports or reviews by randos on the internet -- instead, go to industry literature, and read reports by/for service and warranty providers. They have actual hard data on the types and frequency of problems across brands and models.But back to the main theme of the article: hell to the no was my initial attitude, and I went out of my way to make sure my appliances were as simple as possible. Still, three out of the five were "wifi-enabled" and promised a world of app-enhanced wonders. Needless to say, none of these ever even got anywhere near being set up, and I think I am lucky, all the normal, expected appliance features work without requiring these extras.The idea of remotely preheating my oven while I am not home still makes me shudder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43463200</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yup, always run extra everything. At least you can splice fiber now. And be careful of the minimum bend radius.Once, in the 90s, we were having intermittent network failures in our data center. I kept trying to troubleshoot it with the fluke, but the problem kept moving. When I pulled up the raised floor, I discovered that rats were eating the exterior sheath of the network cables. That was some fun troubleshooting!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1. High-level, the post is all wrong. The point should be that you always need to make sure you can pull new cable. The poster illustrates this: single mode, multi mode, non-fiber, etc, etc. And if one "goes bad", you still can't run a new one, unless you have a pullstring.2. The post cannot apply to fast/large networks - will be prohibitively expensive.3. If running a few at home, I suggest to run MTP/MPO. It's basically a structured cable that can have around 12 fibers in them, plenty of future expansion.Though I'll always run a large awg &gt;&gt;cat6 everywhere so it supports PoE++&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, we got a new house built 4 years ago and one of the biggest regrets is not enough ethernet outlets (running fibre in the house isn't practical yet) and power outlets in various places.  It is really hard to think of all the places you would want them ahead of time unfortunately and as each has a cost you don't want to incur it unnecessarily.But my biggest regrets were:- Only a single ethernet port in the basement.  Then the kid wanted a gaming station and we moved where the TV was.  I should have put like 4 down there.- No ethernet ports in the garage, I should have put in one for an AP.- 4 ceiling APs instead of just two in the main part of the house.  I over-estimated how much coverage I would get from ceiling APs and thus I have some APs hidden under furniture to ensure 100% house coverage.- Lack of multiple circuits in the garage, even better a separate sub-panel with 6 outlets. I took up wood working and with a single circuit and 2 outlets was insufficient.  That cost me $1200 for the sub-panel.- Multiple outlets on the back and side of the house - I would have done two at the front on each side and two at the back on side each and one on each side of the house.  I have a single outlet at the front and back and that is just not sufficient for lights, decorations and patio devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43471177</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of the speed of light as a fundamental constant in physics, particularly within the framework of Einstein's theory of relativity. It explains that the speed of light is the maximum speed at which information and matter can travel and explores the implications of this limit on our understanding of space and time. The text also examines various experiments and theoretical considerations that demonstrate the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum, regardless of the motion of the observer, highlighting its crucial role in modern physics and cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;c is technically the speed of causality. The speed at which perturbations in the fields that make up the universe propagate.The speed of light is a consequence of this, not the cause. Calling c the "speed of light" is putting the cart before the horse.Photons (being massless) have 100% of their velocity in the spatial dimensions and no velocity in the time dimension. They move at the maximum speed that any change in the electrostrongweak force can propagate in our universe because they are not free to do anything else.From a photon's POV a trip across the entire universe happens instantaneously - taking no time whatsoever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please fix the title, it's _c_, not _C_.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;This usage can be traced back to the classic Latin texts in which c stood for "celeritas" meaning "speed".  The uncommon English word "celerity" is still used when referring to the speed of wave propagation in fluidsnot to mention the more common "acceleration"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43472663</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research by Google that investigates how large language models (LLMs) can shed light on language processing in the human brain. It highlights the use of LLM representations to better understand cognitive processes associated with language comprehension and production. The study aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and neuroscience by analyzing the similarities and differences between the way LLMs and humans process language. The findings emphasize the potential of LLMs in providing insights into human cognition and furthering our understanding of language-related brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the OP very difficult to comprehend, to the point that I question whether it has content at all. One difficulty is in understanding their use of the word "embedding", defined (so to speak) as "internal representations (embeddings)", and their free use of the word to relate, and even equate, LLM internal structure to brain internal structure. They are simply assuming that there is a brain "embedding" that can be directly compared to the matrix of numerical weights that comprise an LLM's training. That seems a highly dubious assumption, to the point of being hand-waving.They mention a profound difference in the opening paragraph, "Large language models do not depend on symbolic parts of speech or syntactic rules". Human language models very obviously and evidently do. On that basis alone, it can't be valid to just assume that a human "embedding" is equivalent to an LLM "embedding", for input or output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting. The blog post links several papers, and I recommend reading them.Responses here however seem not commensurate with the evidence presented. Two of the papers[0][1] that provide the sources for the illustration in the blog post are about research conducted on a very small group of subjects. They measure neural activity when listening to a 30 minutes podcast (5000 words). Participants tried to guess next words. All the talk about "brain embedding" is derived from interpreting neuronal activity and sensor data geometrically. It is all very contrived.Very interesting stuff from a neuroscience, linguistics and machine learning perspective. But I will quote from the conclusion of one of the papers[1]: "Unlike humans, DLMs (deep language models) cannot think, understand or generate new meaningful ideas by integrating prior knowledge. They simply echo the statistics of their input"[0] Alignment of brain embeddings and artificial contextual embeddings in natural language points to common geometric patterns (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46631-y)[1] Shared computational principles for language processing in humans and deep language models (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01026-4)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I view this as compelling evidence that current models are more than "stochastic parrots," because as the OP shows, they are learning to model the world in ways that are similar (up to a linear transformation) to those exhibited by the human brain. The OP's findings, in short:* A linear transformation of a speech encoder's embeddings closely aligns them with patterns of neural activity in the brain's speech areas in response to the same speech sample.* A linear transformation of a language decoder's embeddings closely aligns them with patterns of neural activity in the brain's language areas in response to the same language sample.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43439501</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately this makes a mistake by using a short commit ID: "(e.g. a5b3abf)"That's not a full commit ID, so it can still result in a mutable reference if either someone can find a clash[1] or if they can push a tag with that name and it takes priority in the context it is used (this is somewhat complex, e.g. GitHub prohibits pushes of branches and tags which are exactly 40 hex characters long, but other services may not).[1]: https://people.kernel.org/kees/colliding-with-the-sha-prefix...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SHA pinning won't necessarily help if the dependency you are pinning doesn't pin its own dependencies! You still get stuff pulled via vulnerable tags etc. How long till we get this https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/592 ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just started using GitHub Actions for a personal project, and as you do, I trawled HN for opinions on how to use it.At first I built a workflow out of steps published on GitHub. Use ilammy/mms-dev-cmd, lukka/get-cmake, lukka/run-vcpkg, all to build a project with CMake for Windows targets. Of course I referred to actions by SHA like you should   uses: ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@0b201ec74fa43914dc39ae48a89fd1d8cb592756

But one comment stuck with me. Something like, “You should just run your own code on GitHub Actions, rather than piecing it together from publicly available actions.” That made a lot of sense. I ended up writing a driver program for my personal project’s CI builds. One job builds the driver program, and then the next job runs the driver program to do the entire build.I wouldn’t do this if I were getting paid for it… it’s more time-consuming. But it means that I am only minimally tied to GitHub actions. I can run the build driver from my own computer easily enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43473623</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, as someone with their own mail server, these technologies mostly serve to inform me that Russian IP addresses are still trying to send email in the name of my domain for some stupid reason.It makes sense that people whose business is sending email know how to set up email correctly. I'm mostly surprised at how many legitimate sysadmins struggle with getting the basics correct. Surely those dozens of DMARC emails you get that your sendgrid email has been refused because of a bad SPF signature should set in motion some kind of plan to ask if maybe marketing is using them legitimately?Automated signatures are of limited value but I rarely see rejections based on SPF and DKIM that are a mistake. Things are probably worse for big organizations but as a small email server, technical rejections are usually the right call. The only exception is mailing lists, but the dozens of people who still use those can usually figure out how to add an exception for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am just having this problem. Actually getting SPF, DKIM and DMARC right and having a domain with a 0 spam score will still land you in the spam directory. It turns out, you need to have a "reputation"? before your email gets accepted into gmail. My head was spinning as to how that reputation will be built if your email just goes straight to spam.But sure, Linkedin emails are definitively not spam and their dark-patterns at adding you at n+1 emailing list doesn't get them banned from the big (or any?) provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SPF/DKIM is really about mail server reputation. So it mostly benefits larger servers like the ones run by Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. Unfortunately, that means that attempts by those larger providers to combat spam using such reputation will naturally hurt smaller providers. So the actual effects of SPF/DKIM are on the whole negative.The root problem is that we don't actually need to keep track of email server reputation. No one says to themselves "Huh, this is from a Gmail address, it must be legit". We really want to keep track of sender reputation. We need to be able to treat anonymous email differently than email from people we actually know. That implies that we have some work to do on the problem of identity. As it is, there is not even a way for a known email sender to securely introduce an unknown email sender. You know, the way that regular human people normally are able to transfer identities from one to the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468995</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Jakt is a programming language developed for the SerenityOS operating system, designed to provide a simpler syntax and efficient performance for system-level programming. The language aims to deliver modern capabilities, including object-oriented features and comprehensive error handling, making it accessible for developers while maintaining a focus on low-level system access. The GitHub repository includes the language's source code, documentation, and resources for building and contributing to the project, fostering community involvement and ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;

I HATED it when I had to deal with it in the past when working with swift. What's wrong with letting the programmer take the reference whenever they want to? Why do I have to change the whole class when I find something that makes me think it's better to have it passed by value? Why do I have to deal with the complexity of 2 kinds of custom types, with all the existing delicacies of a modern type system? Why on the earth would someone think this is a good idea that is worth taking? Can someone educate me on this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was pretty excited about this, but didn't the Serenity browser recently announce they're going with Swift? That kind of takes the wind out of this language's sails.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43437752</guid></item><item><title>21.

I know that's a low bar, but it seems like at least you're getting two uses out of them at that point...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a realm where government regulations can really make a big difference. China banned single-use plastics. A lot of plastic use is really unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What percentage is actually broken down into monomers? How much microplastic waste is left behind. Given the reliance on "ambient air" I imagine it's not 100%.Regardless, I'm excited to hear about progress on solving the plastic waste crisis.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Reflecting on WikiTok" discusses the phenomenon of WikiTok, where TikTok users create short videos that summarize and explain Wikipedia articles, making educational content more accessible and engaging. It examines the impact of this trend on information dissemination, highlighting both its potential benefits, such as increased interest in learning and the democratization of knowledge, and drawbacks, including issues of accuracy and the superficial treatment of complex topics. The author reflects on the balance between entertainment and education, emphasizing the need for critical consumption of content in the age of social media.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This:  And with regards to AI taking jobs - it obviously will become a serious problem in future. But being a doomer right now is like lying down in a parking lot waiting to get run over - you're surrendering to a pointless outcome while the rest of the world keeps moving.

Great sentiment. I've had a similar experience with LLMs and writing code - helpful when keeping the requests small, and a background in the area is essential for knowing what is and isn't total crap. Feel the fear and do it anyway.Inspiring to see you take on a different career path and go for it, I feel i'm on a similar journey right now, thanks for taking the time to write it up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I built wikitok.io in about 2 hours (but not the iphone app that doesn't work, nor the play store rip off, nor wikitok.net but I'm getting ahead of myself). It all came from this tweet.This phrasing seems to suggest they think they invented the idea of "TikTok but it's Wikipedia". I see the author is OP, so my suggestion might be to consider rephrasing a bit as it comes off a bit accusatory.I did try my hand on this project after seeing this bare-bones viral version. (I had the same idea in my notes app dated a couple years ago.) I went a different route, opting to pre-parse wikitext via my own API to deliver the app an AST that can be rendered natively &amp; prettier than your standard Wikipedia page. Not a fun format to parse. Not fun at all. I don't recommend it. And it took significantly longer than 2 hours and was never released, so props to the author for turning this project around so fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's great that LLMs provide opportunity for non-software engineers to make tech products, but I wonder how those "vibe-coded" products will fare when faced with actually maintaining the code (and also accounting for tech debt..)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468491</guid></item><item><title>23.

Please use a better image model to convert the text into illustration something like napkin.aiI really like the quiz with word search generator. This could be a simple niche which other LMS's might not be targeting. Could be a good side project to a simple tool.One more feedback as ex AI startup builder. When building the product we are in an adrenalin rush to build the coolest features hoping that customers will use it right away if it solves a problem. After launching we realise thats not the case. They only come if the pain is really bad, like there is no alternative. A easy way to workaround this is to build integrations rather than full fledged UI . If you build an integration for existing LMS, the customer will be more likely to try it than a new tool which will have to go through the ardous procurement process of school or any organisation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's heart breaking to think a whole generation will soon be brought up on learning from AI generated slop.Here's my attempt at using this tool:Learning Intention: To understand the differences between MP3 and WAV audio formats and the concept of audio compression.What does AI give us?Rambling text that adds nothing to progress a student's learning intention:Each format has its own strengths and weaknesses, which may affect your listening experience. [..] Choosing between them depends on your needs, whether you value quality or convenience.On a later slide in the same presentation the more rambling appears:Audio compression is vital for efficient sound management. Knowing different types of audio can enhance your media experience.  [..]  Choosing the right audio format is essential for quality and convenience. Understanding audio compression will improve your listening experience.Moving on to the AI generated quizzes with unnecessarily confusing negatives only to find out the AI slop is just flat out wrong:True or false. MP3 files cannot achieve higher quality than WAV files.I pick "true" and get "Incorrect: MP3 files can provide good quality for casual listening, but WAV is superior."Edit: Also be careful with the images, it dropped one into my presentation that I found had been taken from a PDF on the web without attribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451141</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical context and significance of the lost towers associated with the Guelph-Ghibelline Wars in medieval Italy. It explores the architectural styles and purposes of these towers, which served as symbols of power and conflict between the rival factions. The piece highlights notable towers, their current state, and the broader implications of the wars on Italian politics and society during that tumultuous period. Through this exploration, the article aims to shed light on the cultural heritage linked to these structures and the history they represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent research revealing that babies begin forming memories at around six months of age, as demonstrated by advanced brain scans. These scans show brain activity patterns linked to memory formation, suggesting that infants can retain and recall experiences from this early age. The findings provide valuable insights into cognitive development and highlight the importance of early experiences in shaping memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Failure of any of these steps [encoding, long-term etching, and recall of memory] causes amnesia. So, which steps are responsible for the erosion of baby memories?&gt;Who knows! Kids squirm around too much in MRI machines! But they start encoding things around a year, or maybe before, or maybe after!I've been clickbaited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The early years are chaotic. The brain undergoes extensive rewiring. This makes it a difficult to form lasting memories."That is reduced too much from the actual state of research, presumably for the sake of accessibility. We obviously already learn before the hippocampus starts to really develop (18-24 months). But what episodic memory means is that the learned things have no episodic context, i.e. they are learned and applied more broadly, not just in the situation where they were learned in the first place. Learning in the early years isn't "chaotic", it is just very generalized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something must be slightly unusual about me.. because I have retained some very early memories..I have confirmed with my parents the placement and orientation of my crib. I can tell you the exact process that my parents performed to change my diaper. I remember being bathed in my tub with my toys.. list goes on. These are visual memories, I can see them right now. I'm nearly certain they are real.. it's possible my brain has made some up, but I've confirmed enough with my parents that I feel confident that they are real.I swear I remember waking up in the middle of the night once in my crib.. heart beating out of my chest.. I was really scared of something.. and I just remember this pure consciousness .. staring up into the darkness.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of creating a custom C standard library, outlining the reasons for building one, such as specific project requirements or resource constraints. It provides practical steps and considerations for developing a library that aligns with the C programming language's standards, covering essential components like memory management, input/output operations, and string manipulation functions. The author emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and documentation to ensure reliability and usability of the custom library.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's not writing the C++ standard library from scratch. He's writing his own library, in a different namespace, with some similar functionality. It's easy to write a non-standard library that only satisfies your limited subset of needs. People do it all the time. It's not special.The ABI stability boast is based on having no legacy to support. It will work fine as long as everything is shipped only as code and the whole world needs to be rebuilt from scratch every time and even then, you never change any code ever even for a major bugfix. That's hardly practical in the real world where one tiny misstep on the ABI front can result in billion-dollar multinationals threatening suit (ask me how I know). It's a facile claim.The C++ standard library hasn't been known as "the STL" for almost 30 years, ever since part of the STL was modified and adopted into the C++ standard library. Most of the features he's providing implementations for were never a part of the STL (file I/O, strings, hash maps, UTF-8).I maintain an implementation of the C++ standard library for a living. It's a full-time job. It's a huge library (note to the committee: please stop) and it's really easy to mess something up. But if you want to write your own library that doesn't do what the standard library does or meet any of its requirements and implementation constraints or serve its real-world purpose, go right ahead. Just don't claim you're writing your own C++ standard library. You're not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The section about the "perfect ABI stability" is rather naive. If you have a 3rd party library that exposes a class like this in a header:  class SomePublicClass {
    pystd::HashMap&lt;pystd::U8String, size_t&gt; member;
    /*...*/
  };

and distribute that 3rd party library as compiled against a particular pystd version and the headers, then that build is tied to one particular "epoch" or version of pystd, you can't safely link that library against a program that uses a different "epoch" of pystd.It's also not a new idea either. libc++ puts everything inside an inline namespace `std::__1`. There is a reason that they never bumped that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is confusing.
He is not reimplementing the STL.
He is writing some C++ classes providing functionality that is also already implemented in STL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468976</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innovation in data visualization? From a purely utilitarian view, the purpose of data visualization is to present data in a way people can understand it. If you’re constantly changing the method of visualizing the same thing it’s harder to do that. Sometimes a bar chart is best.As far as cool visualizations go (that are better served as nonstandard visualizations) there are two recent ones that come to mind:https://youtu.be/TkwXa7Cvfr8 (Especially around 16:56)https://bbycroft.net/llm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innovation is never constantly increasing. It usually appears in bursts, and stops around the point that humans don't need it as much, or development hits a ceiling of effort. But it's always slowly simmering. Usually it's research or yak-shaving that, after years, suddenly appears as if out of nowhere as a useful product.I am hopeful that in my lifetime, the web will die. It's such an insanely stupid application platform. An OS on an OS, in a document reader (which, due to humans' ability to go to any lengths to avoid hard work, literally all new network protocols have to be built on top of).You want cool visualizations? Maybe don't lock yourself into using a goddamn networked document viewer. Native apps can do literally anything. But here we are, the most advanced lifeforms on the planet, trapped in a cage of our own making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even a small amount of data literacy makes you aware that visualizations can deceive. Pie charts make humans overestimate large percentages, nonzero axis is borderline fraud, choice of colors can totally warp color scales.I think that in this context it is expected for data literacy to make people suspicious of complex visualizations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470971</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the roots of deciduous trees remain active during winter, contrary to common belief that trees become dormant in colder months. Researchers have found that even when above-ground parts lose their leaves and enter dormancy, underground roots continue to grow and seek out nutrients and water. The article emphasizes the importance of this root activity for the tree's resilience, nutrient uptake, and overall health, as well as its implications for forest ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! As a forester, this is interesting to see being researched. Many models in our field link biomass growth strictly to seasonal temperature thresholds, often considering trees to be 'growing' only when mean daily temperatures exceed 5 or 10 degrees Celsius for a consecutive week in spring, and 'idle' otherwise. So basically not accounting for this new "off-season growth", older research are overlooking a bunch of details and insights into growth dynamics. Using coniferous/decidious species as random effects in models has shown to have an effect - this might be why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When controlling invasive plants like honeysuckle using glyphosate, one of the more responsible approaches is to wait until all of the trees have lost their leaves in the fall and entered dormancy. The idea being that because the honeysuckle still has its leaves, you can safely use glyphosate on it with minimal to no impact on the rest of the ecosystem. I've always had my doubts (particularly due to studies on mycelium being exposed to glyphosate), but this is one of best practices that conservation departments recommend.With this new study, it opens the possibility that trees may still have root absorption during the winter season. I feel like it is further evidence of how glyphosate likely always impacts the ecosystem and has no truly safe usage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Our results demonstrate that the above-ground and below-ground parts of a tree follow separate calendars, allowing for underground growth to be prioritized in winter and aerial growth at the beginning of spring,” says CREAF researcher Paolo Zuccarini, a co-author of the study. This divergence could offer a strategic advantage: in winter, while the rest of the tree is dormant, its roots store reserves of carbohydrates and nitrogen-rich substances, such as proteins and amino acids. Thus, when the tree ‘reawakens’, it will have enough nourishment for leaves to bud and photosynthesis to resume, which is essential for trunk and branch growth. “It’s kind of like having building blocks ready to use in the spring, when the priority is to produce leaves so that photosynthesis can start again,” explains Zuccarini.Okay this part makes sense.&gt; Its findings suggest that forest soils have a greater carbon sink capacity than was previously believed, as they accumulate carbon all year long rather than only when trees are more active and their leaves are photosynthesizing.This does not.  They're not accumulating carbon in winter because they're not photosynthesizing carbon dioxide into glucose in winter.  They're using stored carbon to continue cell division (not to mention bribing bacteria &amp; fungi to build a rhizosphere with which to harvest nutrients).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43448035</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Status as a Service" by Eugene Wei explores the concept of social status in the context of modern digital platforms. Wei argues that platforms like social media have transformed status into a commodity that can be earned, measured, and traded, leading to new forms of social currency. He discusses how this shift influences individuals' behaviors, motivation for content creation, and interactions online. The article also examines how the desire for status can drive engagement and addiction to these platforms, ultimately reflecting on the implications for society and personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN, Greg from ARC Prize Foundation here.Alongside Mike Knoop and François Francois Chollet, we’re launching ARC-AGI-2, a frontier AI benchmark that measures a model’s ability to generalize on tasks it hasn’t seen before, and the ARC Prize 2025 competition to beat it.In Dec ‘24, ARC-AGI-1 (2019) pinpointed the moment AI moved beyond pure memorization as seen by OpenAI's o3.ARC-AGI-2 targets test-time reasoning.My view is that good AI benchmarks don't just measure progress, they inspire it. Our mission is to guide research towards general systems.Base LLMs (no reasoning) are currently scoring 0% on ARC-AGI-2. Specialized AI reasoning systems (like R1 or o3-mini) are &lt;4%.Every (100%) of ARC-AGI-2 tasks, however, have been solved by at least two humans, quickly and easily. We know this because we tested 400 people live.Our belief is that once we can no longer come up with quantifiable problems that are "feasible for  humans and hard for AI" then we effectively have AGI. ARC-AGI-2 proves that we do not have AGI.Change log from ARC-AGI-2 to ARC-AGI-2:
* The two main evaluation sets (semi-private, private eval) have increased to 120 tasks
* Solving tasks requires more reasoning vs pure intuition
* Each task has been confirmed to have been solved by at least 2 people (many more) out of an average of 7 test taskers in 2 attempts or less
* Non-training task sets are now difficulty-calibratedThe 2025 Prize ($1M, open-source required) is designed to drive progress on this specific gap. Last year's competition (also launched on HN) had 1.5K teams participate and had 40+ research papers published.The Kaggle competition goes live later this week and you can sign up here: https://arcprize.org/competitionWe're in an idea-constrained environment. The next AGI breakthrough might come from you, not a giant lab.Happy to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; and was the only benchmark to pinpoint the exact moment in late 2024 when AI moved beyond pure memorizationThis is self-referential, the benchmark pinpointed the time when AI went from memorization to problem solving, because the benchmark requires problem solving to complete. How do we know it requires problem solving skills? Because memorization-only LLMs can't do it but humans can.I think ARC are producing some great benchmarks, and I think they probably are pushing forward the state of the art, however I don't think they identified anything particular with o3, at least they don't seem to have proven a step change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent half an hour playing with these now at https://arcprize.org/play and it's fun, but I must say that they are not "easy". So far I eventually solved all of the ones I've gone through, but several took me significantly more than the 2 tries allotted.I wonder if this can be shown to be a valid IQ test, and if so, what IQ would a person need to solve e.g. 90% of them in 1 or 2 tries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43465147</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of Ractors in Ruby, which are designed for parallel execution without thread-safety issues, thereby enhancing performance in concurrent programming. It discusses the limitations of traditional thread-based concurrency and explains how Ractors facilitate isolation and communication between processes. Additionally, the author delves into lock-free data structures, highlighting their benefits in a concurrent environment, such as reduced contention and improved efficiency. The piece aims to educate Ruby developers on utilizing Ractors and implementing lock-free data structures to optimize their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among the deluge of github notifications, I noticed Mike Perham of Sidekiq fame working https://github.com/mperham/ratomic -- "Ratomic provides mutable data structures for use with Ruby's Ractors. This allows Ruby code to scale beyond the infamous GVL."I then see that he posted: https://ruby.social/@getajobmike/114147139715606013"""
After months of work on 8.0, I’ve been trying to prototype a Ractor-based job system using Redis Cluster so the system can scale to hundreds of Redises with minimal effort.The hardest part is Ractors. They are quite difficult to program as they don’t allow lexical scope or closure variable access. I haven’t yet figured out the code patterns necessary for them. I would call it a dialect of Ruby.To be fair, I think I had the same struggles when learning goroutines and channels.
"""Looks like he's trying to scale up sidekiq!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We wanted to use Ractors in our latest Ruby project (which is Rust based using rb-sys/magnus for some parts), but since our users use Google Protobuf inside the code that may run in Ractors, we could not because the library is not Ractor safe[0] (and it's unreasonable for us to ask our users to not be able to use the official Protobuf library).0 - https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/19321&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great read, always appreciate a deeper dive like this. A library of production-ready Ractor-safe data structures would probably get rid of a big roadblock folks are have with adopting them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451285</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports on the passing of Samsung CEO Jong-Hee Han, noting his significant impact on the company's vision and leadership within the technology sector.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just for clarification, Samsung has two CEO's:The deceased Han Jong-hee was a Co-CEO and Vice-Chairman, just like Jun Young-hyun who now remains as the sole CEO.This was not a planned transition or coincidence, Samsung usually had 3 parallel CEO's since 2013 and downsized to two CEO's in 2021, all of those being "Vice-Chairman".On top there is still the Samsung Electronics Chairman, Lee Jae-yong...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a week or so ago, Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong told everyone in Samsung that there's only a "do or die" attitude.https://www.kedglobal.com/leadership-management/newsView/ked...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Based on the notice Samsung published, Han's co-CEO Young-Hyun Jun is now the sole CEO of the company. Jun, who also heads Samsung's semiconductor business, was appointed as Han's co-CEO in November 2024.I guess he had been co-CEO since November. That’s about as smooth of a transition one could hope for? (As far as the company welfare goes.) My thoughts are with his family. An abrupt loss like this must be painful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470699</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the connections between World War I and F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," highlighting how the war influenced the themes, characters, and societal perspectives in the novel. It discusses the impact of the war on American society in the 1920s, illustrating the disillusionment and changes in values that emerged from the conflict. The piece analyzes specific elements of the story, such as the character of Jay Gatsby and the American Dream, in the context of the war's lasting effects, ultimately suggesting that WWI is a pivotal backdrop that shapes the narrative and emotional landscape of Fitzgerald's work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always a great opportunity to post my favorite passage of him about WWI- just hauntingly beautiful:“See that little stream — we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it — a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do that again in this generation.”“Why, they’ve only just quit over in Turkey,” said Abe. “And in Morocco —”“That’s different. This western-front business couldn’t be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldn’t. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren’t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiancée, and little cafés in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather’s whiskers.”“General Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty- five.”“No, he didn’t — he just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in Marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes of Wurtemburg and Westphalia. Why, this was a love battle — there was a century of middle-class love spent here. This was the last love battle.”F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tender is the Night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting look at some of the details of The Great Gatsby that connect to World War I, and Fitzgerald's own history with the war.The museum that published this is quite good, though sadly a bit out of the way for many on this site (Kansas City). It's easily reachable with public transit if you're ever there and staying near downtown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions that Gatsby's stories are a little inconsistent, and that Nick would have realized this. Do critics generally think that Gatsby fully made them up and perhaps bought a Montenegro medal, or is he just being loose with details?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43472320</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered that a massive iceberg, the size of Chicago, which broke off from Antarctica, is revealing an ancient ecosystem that had been hidden beneath it for thousands of years. As the iceberg melts, researchers are uncovering various marine organisms that thrived in the long-sheltered environment, providing insights into climate change and how ecosystems respond to shifting conditions. This finding highlights the potential impacts of global warming on ice-covered regions and underscores the importance of studying these newly exposed habitats to understand past ecological dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found that the PydanticAI [0] framework strikes a perfect balance between control and abstraction.I’m building a non trivial AI app and the validation and dependency injection is such a great addition compared to using the LLM libraries directly.[0] https://ai.pydantic.dev/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that's nice in LangGraph is the flexibility in what a node is.  A node doesn't have to be an agent it can be any State manipulation function.  So you can create nodes that exclusively do preprocessing or postprocessing and get your run loop as close as possible to just ainvoke on your graph repeatedly.You can have a subclass of your Node class be an AgentNode class and then subclass that for each type of Agent and then when you declare your Graph object you pass in the data to instantiate the AgentNode with the type of data it needs.  It is a bit weird that LangGraph doesn't have a default Node class but it sort of makes sense that they want you to write it in a way that makes sense for how you use it.I do highly recommend abstracting your graph into Node and Edge classes (with appropriate subclasses) and being able to declare your graph in a constant that you can pass to a build_graph method.  Getting as much code reuse as possible dramatically simplifies debugging graph issuses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read the article but have yet to understand why someone would want to use a framework that introduces meaningless abstractions that are not properly documented or well maintained -aka, they often introduce breaking changes.I’m interested in a useful agentic framework but LangGraph doesn’t seem to cut it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468435</guid></item><item><title>39.

Here's some (unstructured, rushed) feedback:Consider adding some PWA metadata (manifest) so there's a bit more space when the app is added to the home screen.Are you using perfect-freehand? If so, you might wanna give Steve Ruiz a shoutout!The latency is not bad (iOS Safari) to be fair. I'd check how this works with the Apple Pencil though (including the additional APIs and pen properties it opens)I have giant fingers, so this is nice for doodles, but writing gets frustrating. a basic zoom would fix that (problem: keeping the UI non obtrusive).Consider adding colour (even a pre-defined palette to keep this super simple, say 3-4 colours). I got some fun creations from people who played with a similar project (https://lines.potato.horse), largely because they had just the right amount of creative control.Also, consider adding an OLED-friendly colour scheme (with perfect blacks #000). Some inspiration: https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/night-rider/ and https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/dark-mode-articles/(100% yak shave here, so not important) but: I'd check if the note content could be shared with the link (e.g. via data URIs) (mostly for fun)Ah, finally, make it plomk like mmm.page or potato.horse (disable silent mode and click on the nav)! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool, though it doesn't seem to work on Firefox on Android - I had to use Chrome to get it to work.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of barefoot running that gained popularity in 2010, examining the hype surrounding it and the subsequent trends in running shoes. It highlights the arguments made by advocates of barefoot running, including claims of improved foot health and natural biomechanics, while also addressing concerns and criticisms from experts regarding potential injuries and the importance of proper transition. The piece ultimately reflects on how the barefoot running movement influenced the running industry, leading to a surge in minimalist shoe designs, but also suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be suitable for every runner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole mythos of running barefoot got me and my wife into running! We did actual barefoot just a little bit before switching to toe shoes. We ran in those until 2021. We only switched to Xeros because of the "grass stuck between the toes" effect when hiking and the ability to get slightly thicker soles with lugs.From when we started in 2009 to today, we both had to increase two shoe sizes.She just finished her first 50 mile ultramarathon using Xero thin soled shoes. It was half on the AT, and she had no issues with that.I'm a less serious runner, just enough to be able to knock out a few miles on demand and the annual Broad Street 10 mile run.We both hiked 1000 miles of the AT on a thru in 2022. We've also clocked around 3O00 miles of other small day hikes and overnight trips. All with Zeros or Altras, and with a 30lb pack.Over the years, she's had some minor issues with plantar fascitis that went away when she added in regular stretching. She's had a few bouts of hip bursitis when ramping up mileage for the ultra.I've had some issues with knee pain that started on the thru hike related to scoliosis. My one hip drops lower than the other, twisting the knee and causing issues on both. Regular single leg exercises and heavy lifting keeps that in check (hard to do on the trail unfortunately).Neither of us have had any issues with ankles, calves, or typical runner knee issues. I'm not sure I can credit the shoes for all of it, but I'm very glad we started with them and neither of us have any reason to change. Regular thick foam trainers now feel very uncomfortable, it's hard to describe. They squish my toes (which are very wide). They change my gait which feels awkward.It's funny, now I feel like I see lots of runners in my area using these thin soled shoes, like the Merrel Vaporglove, Xeros, or alternative. Maybe it's cohort bias? Either way I am glad I found them when I did!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barefoot running might have died as a fad, but, fortunately, the biomechanical benefits from the minimalist footwear inspired by the movement haven't gone away.I only own minimalist footwear (zero heel to toe drop, wide toe box, no toe spring). Dress shoes, sneakers, sandals; all of it.They helped me get off of orthotics, which I've worn for over 20 years, while reducing stress on my knees (I have osteoarthritis in my right knee) and making what little arches I have in my feet stronger.It's a shame that pop culture seems to have _ran_ in the other direction (maximalist ultra-cushioned clown shoes). I honestly have no idea how people walk in those things. I purchased a pair of BOHEMPIA minimalist hemp chucks the other day. It came with a ~2-4mm insert for comfort. It felt like the cushion from the inserts made my legs work so much harder. All felt right once I took them off.That said, I never ran barefoot except for a very short segment one time. Actual barefoot running is a whole other experience. Huaraches, which I've also run with, don't compare. I'm scared to do it more often due to glass shards and other fun things on the road, but if I ran more often and on smooth, unobstructed pavement, I'd absolutely do it barefoot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd alway been prone to avoiding shoes. I started running when I was 16 (1986). During high school I'd run 10-14 miles a night about five days a week, mostly barefoot.I didn't start regularly wearing shoes until after college. Since I started wearing shoes there has been a significant change in my foot structure. My big toes have moved outward by at least 10 degrees. Before then they were directly in-line with the bones and ligaments running down the foot.When you walk and run barefoot your foot soles get much thicker. You learn how to respond to your feet. I tend to not get splinters or glass slivers because I can feel them before I put my full weight down. Even when something does pierce the skin, it doesn't penetrate the sole, and I can just pick up my foot and grab it out with my fingers.One of the most interesting benefits seems to be resistance to fungal infections.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In ecology it's recognized that highly alkaline lakes are some of the most productive[0] ecosystems around. Despite this, most organisms able to survive in highly alkaline environments are considered "extremophiles".Maybe it's the rest of us that are the extremophiles.[0] In ecology "productive" is usually measured by the rate at which biomass is measured in a system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is being suggested purely because of phosphorus availability there?  How does this compare on that aspect to say the the theory that life arose in alkaline hydrothermal vents?  (Note: Alkaline hydrothermal vents are not to be confused with "black smokers", the more famous kind of hydrothermal vent.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially also supports the idea that subsurface channels and cavities could also have been involved with providing environments for early life.  There would have been high heat, a range of minerals including phosphorus, and a wide variety of interconnected cavities that could act as reaction chambers or even cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43472668</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit confused on whether "other models that may more reliably mimic human biology" generally exist today. The article mentions a couple non-animal models, but do we know that they are better analogues, or are they just ideas of where research might go if people didn't expect in vivo results? The point of in vivo studies, after all, is that it's easy to build artificial models which accidentally strip out some important complicating factor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In general, Krebs says, NGO grants for animal-free research tend to be smaller than the longer-term, multimillion-dollar awards offered by government sources such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research.... for now. Given the widely circulated "naughty words" list for grants [1], I would not be surprised at all if this kind of research gets labeled and discarded as "woke" just as well.[1] https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/03/15/these-197-t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43440143</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents the closing keynote speech by Leslie Lamport at the 22nd Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE 22x). In his talk, Lamport discusses significant contributions to the field of distributed systems and formal verification, emphasizing the importance of rigor in software engineering.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bah that old thing again. FWIW the demo scene 'coders' call themselves that with pride, and usually those are often also brilliant 'programmers' and 'software engineers'.Coder, programmer, software engineer call yourself whatever you want, the point is to make a computer do what you want it to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see the keynote next year; 'vibing isn't coding isn't programming isn't ...; a pyramid of shite that sometimes works a bit'. I am happy Dijkstra doesn't have to see this; he was angry in the 80s in my parents living room; I cannot even imagine what he would be with 'vibe coding'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leslie Lamport's SCaLE 22x Keynote: Think, Abstract, Then CodeLamport argued for a fundamental shift in programming approach, emphasizing thinking and abstraction before coding, applicable to all non-trivial code, not just concurrent systems.    Abstraction First: Define an abstract view (the "what" and "how") of your program before writing code. This high-level design clarifies logic and catches errors early. Focus on ideas, not specific languages.

    Algorithms != Programs: Algorithms are abstract concepts; programs are concrete implementations.

    Executions as States: Model program executions as sequences of states, where each state's future depends only on its present. This simplifies reasoning, especially for concurrency.

    Invariants are Crucial: Identify invariants—properties true for all states of all executions. Understanding these is essential for correctness.

    Precise Specifications Matter: Many library programs lack clear specifications, hindering correct usage, particularly with concurrency. precise, language-independent descriptions of functionality are necessary.

    Writing is Thinking: Writing forces clarity and exposes sloppy thinking. Thinking improves writing. It's a virtuous cycle.

    Learn to Abstract: Abstraction is a core skill, central to mathematics. Programmers need to develop this ability.

    AI for Abstraction? The question was raised whether or not AI models could be utilized for abstract thought processes in programming, due to their seeming nature.

The core message: Programming should be a deliberate process of thoughtful design (abstraction) followed by implementation (coding), with a strong emphasis on clear specifications and understanding program behavior through state sequences and invariants. Thinking is always better than not thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43469711</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;Feudle is a fun, engaging word-guessing game inspired by the popular Family Feud show. Players must guess words that are part of the most common responses to various survey questions. The game challenges players' knowledge and ability to think like the general public, providing a new question each day to keep the gameplay fresh and entertaining. Users can compete solo or with friends to see who can correctly identify the most popular answers quickly. The site typically features instructions, daily challenges, and community engagement options for players.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;1. I spent around 5-8 minutes on the site and got multiple (4 or 5) modal “subscribe to my newsletter” popups, some  within seconds of each other. This is extraordinarily obnoxious and is enough for me to never want to visit your website again, regardless of its other merits.2. I’m on mobile, and while the keyboard interface looks nice, it performs much worse than my phone’s native keyboard. There are multiple reasons for this: it’s laggy and routinely drops inputs; it doesn’t allow for alternative input schemes like swiping (I’m not an accessibility expert but I imagine it’s a disaster for anyone with serious accessibility needs), and it “feels” less accurate than the phone’s native keyboard input. Plus, its behavior and letter positioning is just very jarring compared to how I expect my phone keyboard to behave, which adds to how annoying it is to use.3. Today’s prompt seemed fine, but the surveyed prompts for “next time” all seem rather low quality. I’m not sure how you’re generating these, but you should probably spend a bit more time doing QA, especially while you’re trying to build a user base; speaking personally, seeing that “Besides white christmas, name a song on big crosby’s white christmas album”[sic] is a potential future prompt really does not inspire confidence and makes me rather uninterested in ever coming back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool game. Concept is not new, but good execution.Here is some feedback:1. Remove the annoying popup
2. Use native elements for input, I don't know what is it in your code, but this is not native, because when I type, Vimium plugin intercepts my input rather than the input box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very good reminds me of Family Fortunes the 80s UK game show&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43471939</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research on genetically modified mosquitoes that utilize a gene drive system to combat diseases like malaria. These mosquitoes are engineered to spread genes that inhibit the malaria parasite's ability to infect humans, potentially reducing transmission. The study highlights the effectiveness of this approach in laboratory settings, as well as the ethical considerations and ecological impacts of releasing such modified organisms into the wild. The researchers emphasize the need for further studies to assess long-term effects and safety before any potential field trials.&lt;/p&gt;

Being able to forcibly propagate a gene through a population seems like a strong candidate for causing an ecological disaster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off-topic: Has anyone good recommendations against mosquitos? I hear UV traps are ok, but not perfect. And of course I have used the anti mosquito sprays. They don't last long though and I don't like the smell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of using gene drive on mosquitoes has been circulating for at least 8 years. [1] In that time, something like 4 million people have died of malaria, many millions more have been infected, and it is significantly impacting the economic growth of Africa.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kevin Murphy's lecture on Frost is the best one I've ever heard:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5140uJOUDEHe first recaps the conventional view people have about Frost, then reads "The Road Not Taken", his most famous poem, and then completely takes Frost AND the poem AND THEN the public's misunderstanding of Frost apart.Don't get fooled by the bare visual appearance of Murphy, his empty blackboard (no PPT, no bs) - this lecture is a fantastic, suprising and deeply disturbing (regarding what is revealed about Frost and his public misappreciation). Simply priceless teaching - thank you, dear colleague.EDIT: If you ask ChatGPT for a "10-20 sentence interpretation of The Road Not Taken", it falls right into the trap that Murphy warns about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; He responded to my October 2022 email, explaining that he had “stopped writing much journalism as of 2015 so as to avoid distractions from a book project that I thought would take an almost unfathomably long time—two years or perhaps even three. Seven years later, I’m doing my best to polish the third draft.”One encounters this over and over again—even books that successfully get finished and published take far longer than expected, very consistently, and especially any involving research. Books (non-fiction in particular) written as series often also expand from, say, five planned volumes in the forward to the first edition of the first volume, to (say) a dozen.Reminds me of software estimation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humble plug for my poetry app. When I was getting into poetry I was reading a lot of them online but found the majority of sites to have awful designs with garish ads that completely detracted from the poem. So I wrote a scraper which downloaded 40,000 poems that were in the public domain and rendered them in an iOS app with a beautiful design. Crafting individual profiles for all of the poets was painstaking and arduous, but the users seem to really enjoy the app so far. I do already have some AI analysis for arcane poems (but I don’t explicitly mention that it’s AI as I think apps should never say that - it doesn’t interest users, only investors).https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-poetry-corner/id1602552624&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468498</guid></item><item><title>1.

Do they forge them? Or are these data treated as not important enough (like it 2 files with different metadata but identical contents should have the same checksum when hashed)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the build infrastructure for Debian also reproducible? It seems like we if someone wants to inject malware in Debian package binaries (without injecting them into the source), they have to target the build infrastructure (compilers, linkers and whatever wrapper code is written around them).Also, is someone else also compiling these images, so we have evidence that the Debian compiling servers were not compromised?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484520</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a personal rule which has worked really well for me: if I do a project, the price of doing that project is that I have to write about it.Back when Twitter threads didn't suck (they could be viewed by people without Twitter accounts) I'd use those - tweet a description of my project with a link, then follow it with a few photos and screenshots.These days I use my blog, with my "projects" tag: https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects/I blog all sorts of other stuff, but if I was ever to trim back the one thing I'd keep doing is projects. If you make a thing, write about that thing. I wrote more about that here: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/#pro...Projects with a GitHub repository make this even easier: describe the project in the README and drop in a few screenshots - that's all you need.(Screenshots are important though, they're the ultimate defense against bitrot.)I have many projects from earlier in my career that I never documented or captured in screenshot form and I deeply regret it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known."Fully" seems to be doing a helluva lot of heavy lifting in this piece. Does anyone think that they mean anything other than "making money", as they quickly segue into talking about entrepreneurship and founding businesses?I'm happy to concede that if you don't tell anyone about the stuff you do, no one will know. But I am not willing to concede that you only "fully" benefit from your work if you sell it. Nor am I willing to concede that work only has value if sold. I'm also not entirely certain the author is pushing those views. Still, something about this piece doesn't sit well with me.Human endeavors have value beyond the monetary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of truth in this article.I work in a large FAANG company. For more than 10 years, I made the error of not publishing my personal work and ideas. I didn't like the rules about personal works, publishing opensource or social media communication... you are subject to gate-keeping by your employer if you are an employee. That's quite different from my previous experience in smaller companies in Europe. I found it very off putting: you had to give up ownership. I thought it was demeaning that even what I create in my own private time would be owned and attributed to someone else.My choice of not publishing anything however was a very bad one. I didn't understand what power is: the continuity of the Self into the Other, where you find your-Self at ease. If you don't assert yourself, you give up not just your power but your very identity.The truth is that power is dialectic. If you don't speak up, you have no power. Both in what you create, and in the relationship of and with power that you live, you are constantly redefining the boundaries of what you are and what you are not. If you remain silent, you loose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476249</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a detailed guide on the implementation and usage of the OpenAI Agents in Python, specifically focusing on Multi-Agent Cooperative Protocols (MCP). It outlines the architecture, key concepts, and functionalities of the framework, providing users with installation instructions, code examples, and documentation for creating and managing agents that can collaboratively perform tasks. The content emphasizes practical applications, performance metrics, and customization options for developers interested in leveraging these advanced AI systems for cooperative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today MCP added Streamable HTTP [0] which is a huge step forward as it doesn't require an "always-on" connection to remote HTTP servers.However, if you look at the specification it's clear bringing the LSP-style paradigm to remote HTTP servers is adding a bunch of extra complexity. This is a tool call, for example:    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 2,
      "method": "tools/call",
      "params": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": {
          "location": "New York"
        }
      }
    }

Which traditionally would just be HTTP POST to `/get_weather` with `{ "location": "New York" }`.I've made the suggestion to remove some of this complexity [1] and fall back to just a traditional HTTP server, where a session can be negotiated with an `Authorization` header and we rely on traditional endpoints / OpenAPI + JSON Schema endpoint definitions. I think it would make server construction a lot easier and web frameworks would not have to materially be updated to adhere to the spec -- perhaps just adding a single endpoint.[0] https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-2...[1] https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/issues...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't I do function calling in OpenAPI? I also feel like MCP is reinventing the wheel.I have been converting OpenAPI documents into function calling schemas and doing tool calling since function calling first came out in 2023, but it's not easy to recreate a backend server to fit MCP.Also, these days, I'm making a compiler-driven function calling specialized framework, but I'm a little cautious about whether MCP will support it. It enables zero-cost tool calling for TypeScript classes based on the compiler, and it also supports OpenAPI.However, in the case of MCP, in order to fit this to the compiler-driven philosophy, I need to create a backend framework for MCP development first, or create an add-on library for a famous framework like NestJS. I can do the development, but there's so much more to do compared to OpenAPI tool calling, so it's a bit like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.That analogy may be helpful for mom, but not for me as a software engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485566</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "LOVE LETTER" on GitHub discusses the principles and motivations behind the development of the Xan project, which aims to facilitate the creation and sharing of digital content. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration, openness, and fostering a supportive community among creators. The letter highlights the project’s commitment to empowering individuals by providing tools and resources that encourage creativity, expression, and the exploration of new ideas in the digital landscape. It ultimately calls for participation and engagement from users to contribute to the project's goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The post should at least mention in passing the major problem with CSV: it is a "no spec" family of de-facto formats, not a single thing (it is an example of "historically grown").
And omission of that meams I'm going to have to call this our for its bias (but then it is a love letter, and love makes blind...).Unlike XML or JSON, there isn't a document defining the grammar of well-formed or valid CSV files, and there are many flavours that are incompatible with each other in the sense that a reader for one flavour would not be suitable for reading the other and vice versa. Quoting, escaping, UTF-8 support are particular problem areas, but also that you cannot tell programmatically whether line 1 contains column header names or already data (you will have to make an educated guess but there ambiguities in it that cannot be resolved by machine).Having worked extensively with SGML for linguistic corpora, with XML for Web development and recently with JSON I would say programmatically, JSON is the most convenient to use regarding client code, but also its lack of types makes it useful less broadly than SGML, which is rightly used by e.g. airlines for technical documntation and digital humanities researchers to encode/annotate historic documents, for which it is very suitable, but programmatically puts more burden on developers. You can't have it all...XML is simpler than SGML, has perhaps the broadest scope and good software support stack (mostly FOSS), but it has been abused a lot (nod to Java coders: Eclipse, Apache UIMA), but I guess a format is not responsible for how people use or abuse it. As usual, the best developers know the pros and cons and make good-taste judgments what to use each time, but some people go ideological.(Waiting for someone to write a love letter to the infamous Windows INI file format...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSV is ever so elegant but it has one fatal flaw - quoting has "non-local" effects, i.e. an extra or missing quote at byte 1 can change the meaning of a comma at byte 1000000.  This has (at least) two annoying consequences:1. It's tricky to parallelise processing of CSV.
2. A small amount of data corruption can have a big impact on the readability of a file (one missing or extra quote can bugger the whole thing up).So these days for serialisation of simple tabular data I prefer plain escaping, e.g. comma, newline and \ are all \-escaped.  It's as easy to serialise and deserialise as CSV but without the above drawbacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSV works because CSV is understood by non technical people who have to deal with some amount of technicality. CSV is the friendship bridge that prevents technical and non technical people from going to war.I can tell an MBA guy to upload a CSV file and i'll take care of it. Imagine i tell him i need everything in a PARQUET file!!! I'm no longer a team player.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484382</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses improvements to the shell history search functionality, emphasizing the need for better ways to navigate and manage command history in shell environments. It suggests enhancements such as user-friendly search features, filtering options, and historical context to streamline the process of finding and reusing previously executed commands. The author underscores the importance of an efficient history search for boosting productivity and enhancing the user experience in command-line interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Atuin, but unlike the author actually find it more valuable since I use it across many machines. I have 7 different machines (of various make and OS though all *NIX) in my house right now that I regularly SSH in to or use directly, and Atuin's sync keeps my history on all of them. If I want to narrow down by host I can still do that. I also keep similar directory structures so I can narrow down by directory even if I performed a command on a different machine most of the time.That said, some form of advanced history search is a game changer, no matter how you get it. It's one of those "can't understand how I lived without it" things once you get it going.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love fzf but no need to invent the wheel here if you are using zsh. check out one of these zle plugins. (Demo https://asciinema.org/a/155704)I prefer these two, you get good performance, search that is semi-shell syntax aware, ranking that takes age somewhat into account, and syntax hilighting.https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-wo... with https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlightin...or the same thing but older, for those who like older things because they have an air of stability about them: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using McFly [1] recently, and like it a lot.&gt; McFly replaces your default ctrl-r shell history search with an intelligent search engine that takes into account your working directory and the context of recently executed commands. McFly's suggestions are prioritized in real time with a small neural network.[1] https://github.com/cantino/mcfly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476793</guid></item><item><title>7.

You have a really bright future ahead of you, and your parents must be really proud (at least I would be if you were my kid.) Hit me up if you want a summer internship finding security vulnerabilities at a hotel software startup (access control, property management, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing—made even more impressive by the fact that the author is just 15 years old!Also, it's nice to see this mentioned:&gt; For this 10k-word write-up, I spent around a month finishing up the main parts, and refining/editing it took an extra while. Writing this is indeed a painful process. I spent the entire day on the weekend and 4-5 hours during the rest of the week working on it for around two weeks.It's the kind of behind-the-scenes effort that often goes unspoken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to execute the PoC by running the following:  git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git &amp;&amp; cd llama.cpp
  git checkout c0d4843225eed38903ea71ef302a02fa0b27f048 # Checkout a revision prior to the exploit fix in 1d20e53c40c3cc848ba2b95f5bf7c075eeec8b19
  mkdir build-rpc &amp;&amp; cd build-rpc
  cmake .. -DGGML_RPC=ON
  cmake --build . --config Release
  cd bin/
  ./rpc-server -p 50052

In a second terminal:  nc -lvp 1337

Then running the exploit code in a third terminal (from llama.cpp/build-rpc/bin directory):  pip install pwntools
  python exp.py # From https://gist.github.com/retr0reg/d13de3fde8f9d138fe1af48e59e630a9

It failed at Stage Three: Bypass boundary check via libggml and raised an EOFError. The RPC server exited with Segmentation fault. Any idea why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451935</guid></item><item><title>8.

If you can't afford a lawyer, they will provide you with a joke. And if you can afford a lawyer, now its just a question if you are willing to spend more on your lawyer than the state is hoping to extort from you. If you are, you will get off no problem, if you aren't or can't, most courts are going to try and screw you over. Oh whats that, you want to actually fight your charges in court? Now you better not lose because you are on the hook for all of the money the court wants to believe it cost them to prosecute you. Oh you don't want to risk that and just settle for whatever minor fine the law says you might owe? Don't worry, the courts will still fuck you with the addition in mandatory minimum court fees, additional fees and fines not stipulated under the law you broke, inflated "programs" that they get kickbacks from, and an even better excuse for cops in the future to try and screw you over by painting you as some wanton criminal.Just like healthcare, US justice is only for people with money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Two men were released after The Times asked about them, half a year after their sentences had been completed."Horrific.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing dominance of AI crawlers in web traffic, which has led to significant challenges for developers and website owners. Many sites have reported that a large portion of their traffic now comes from these automated systems rather than human users, prompting some to implement measures that block access from entire countries to mitigate the impact. The implications of this trend include concerns about data misuse, the accuracy of web analytics, and the potential changes in how content is consumed and interacted with online.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the proper answer is to aim for the bots to get _negative_ utility value from visiting our sites, that is poisoning their well, not just zero value, that is to block them.Did you try to GET a canary page forbidden in robots.txt? Very well, have a bucket load of articles on the benefits of drinking bleach.Is your user-agent too suspicious? No problem, feel free to scrape my insecure code (google "emergent misalignment" for more info).A request rate too inhuman? Here, take those generated articles about positive effect of catching measles on performance in bed.And so on, and so forth ...Nepenthes is nice, but word salad can be detected easily. It needs a feature that pre-generates linguistically plausible but factically garbage text via open models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It remains unclear why these companies don't adopt more collaborative approaches and, at a minimum, rate-limit their data harvesting runs so they don't overwhelm source websites.If the target goes down after you scrape it, that's a feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After I opened up https://sugaku.net to be usable without login, it was astounding how quickly the crawlers started.  I'd like the site to be accessible to all, but I've had to restrict most of the dynamic features to logged in users, restrict robots.txt, use cloudflare to block AI crawlers and bad bots, and I'm still getting ~1M automated requests per day (compared to ~1K organic), so I think I'll need to restrict the site to logged in users soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476337</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Go.dev discusses core types in the Go programming language, emphasizing their significance in building efficient and effective programs. It explains various built-in core types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings, detailing their properties and use cases. The piece also highlights the importance of understanding these types for improving code quality, performance, and maintainability. Additionally, it provides practical examples and insights into how these core types are fundamental to Go's type system, aiding developers in leveraging them correctly in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love and continue to love how seriously the Go team takes breaking spec changes, as well as spec changes in general.Go generics are a bit of a blip in this to be honest, A) because it is a big change, and B) because it can be difficult to use (generic functions defined on types cannot use generic parameters that aren't defined on that type, for example).But in a way, I also think the constraints help avoid the overuse of generics. I have seen Java and Typescript projects where developers had way too much fun playing around with the type system, and the resulting code is actually quite unclear.In conclusion, I pray the Go team strive to and continue to be conservative with the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could think of the Go dev team's last ten years as trying to find the right balance between features (asked for by the expert devs that use Go) and simplicity (a value that the designers hold, but that most expert devs making feature requests don't care about). Generics always felt to me like this dynamic in a nutshell. Lots of good reasons to prefer generics when you need them, and it feels like a nearly ecosystem-killing amount of complexity to implement a type system like Rust on top of Go - there's literally almost no reason to use Go in that case.Anyway, I like seeing this slight reversion in favor of simplicity, I think it's the right call for where Go's targeted: being a better Java for teams of mid-tier engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! For anyone wondering, Go 1.25 won't be adding any actual language features. It's a minor release.Maybe we get sum types by 1.30 :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43483842</guid></item><item><title>11.

Code is a tree, not a sequence — yet we feed it to models linearly, with no explicit structure. Todays models lack recurrence or true memory, so they can’t reason over hierarchical structures effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which tools can currently invoke MCP?

&lt;p&gt;Botswana has successfully launched its first satellite, BotSAT-1, marking a significant milestone in the country's space exploration efforts. The satellite, developed through a collaboration between the Botswana government and various international partners, aims to enhance the nation's capabilities in areas such as natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. This achievement not only boosts Botswana's technological advancements but also places the country on the map within the global space community. The launch is seen as a step towards fostering local expertise in space technology and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many strong opinions here from commenters who aren’t actually from Botswana. Let me tell you how we actually feel about it here.We think it’s awesome! The establishment of a university of science and technology in Botswana has been a long hard road, and many mistakes have been made along the way. But the fact that Botswana now has the local skill to deploy a satellite and make use of the data it provides to inform decisions blows my mind.I grew up in the village that now hosts the university. We were so isolated back then that I’d listen to the Voice of America and marvel at the things that were being done in the developed world, and wonder if we would ever be able to participate in that level. The fact that a smart kid can grow up to attend a local university and end up launching a SATELLITE INTO SPACE is incredible!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a whole satellite now in orbit for the people of Botswana.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a comprehensive study of deep learning techniques applied to unsupervised learning, particularly focusing on how these methods can improve performance in various tasks without requiring labeled data. It reviews several prominent models and algorithms, discussing their strengths and weaknesses while exploring the underlying principles that enable them to learn effectively from unlabelled datasets. The paper also highlights future directions for research in this area, aiming to advance the capabilities and applicability of unsupervised learning in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476134"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the ML problem I'm working on now, there are about a dozen simple hyperparameters, and each training run takes hours or even days. I don't think there's any good way to search the space of hyperparameters without a deep understanding of the problem domain, and even then I'm often surprised when a minor config tweak yields better results (or fails to). Many of these hyperparameters affect performance directly and are very sensitive to hardware limits, so a bad value leads to an out-of-memory error in one direction or a runtime measured in years in the other. It's a real-world halting problem on steroids.This is not to even mention more complex design decisions, like the architecture of the model, which can't be captured in a simple hyperparameter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does it compare to previous work on learning to learn? I don't see it referenced https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article, very clear. I was particularly curious because I've observed functions of the formf : x -&gt; argmin_y g(x,y)are generally not smooth, like not even continuous, even though, as the article points out, every step of the program to approximate argmin is differentiable.There are several issues with this kind of function. First, it's not even necessarily well defined. There could be two or more argmin values for each x value. Your algorithm will find just the one, but the underlying mathematical object is still ill-defined.A second issue is that optimization algorithms don't converge to argmin to begin with, but to local minima. The value can differ dramatically in a completely unpredictable way. "Converge" is also an important word, as they stop before reaching the exact value; if g has mins that vary by less than your floating point representation can handle (for an extreme case), the problem is effectively numerically ill-posed even though it could be mathematically well-posed.Lastly, even when everything is well behaved, that is single global optimum, ideal optimizer that finds it exactly, g is infinitely smooth, then consider:- g(x,y) = sin(x)cos(y) defined on [-pi/2,pi/2]^2- for x in ]0,pi/2], sin(x) &gt; 0, thus sin(x)cos(y) is minimized for y = -pi/2- for x in [-pi/2,0[, sin(x) &lt; 0, thus sin(x)cos(y) is minimized for y = pi/2It follows that the function f is -pi/2 Heaviside, which is not even continuous. In conclusion, even when everything is very simple, perfectly behaved, any approach that relies on differentiating the result of a minimization procedure is standing on some very fragile scaffolding.For these reasons, I find the article stops at the most important part: it assesses the smoothness of such a function f empirically, but it does not explain how you might go about regularizing one found in the wild. This is the most crucial step in my opinion, because otherwise we're still somewhat stuck at tinkering effectively blindly in most cases. I don't mean any disrespect of what's otherwise very interesting and clearly thorough work, but since this is posted on a "layman forum", I just meant to point out what I think is an important limitation to how far-reaching the work here is.---Typo in Definition 2: 2hv? Or is this related to h(\Delta_f(z+h;h) - \Delta_f(z;h))? (unsure if it's the authors posting this)I personally also find the Delta_f notation confusing, I think a more elegant notation coherent with the paper's other notations would have been\frac{\delta f}{\delta v}(z;h)Note that df/dx is a directional derivative wrt the basis vector x, it's no trouble putting any v there. Lowercase delta is often used as a discrete difference, so I think this fits the finite difference gradient well. As for the (z;h), this mirrors how the differential is often written: at z and applied to h. (the h is lost in the article's \Delta_f notation)Question on Definition 2: why take the sign of the vectors, and then compute a weighted scalar product of that? not just compute the scalar product of the raw vectors and normalize by their norms? This would be in [-1,1] as well, so I'm curious why this particular measure was chosen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476134</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the function-calling capabilities in Google’s Gemma, an AI tool designed to facilitate seamless interactions between users and APIs. It details how the function-calling feature allows developers to define specific functions that the AI can execute in response to relevant user queries. This functionality enhances the AI's ability to provide contextual responses and perform actions based on user inputs, thereby improving the overall utility and interactivity of applications built using Gemma.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey folks,
I'm on the Gemma team, we released new model(s) just recently, and I saw many questions here about function calling. We just published the docs to detail this more. In short Gemma3's prompted instruction following is quite good for the larger models and that's how you use the feature.You don't need to take our word for it! We were waiting for an external and independent validation from the Berkeley team, and they just published their results. You can use their metrics to get a rough sense of performance, and of course try it out yourself in AIstudio or locally with your own prompts.https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.htmlHope you all enjoy the models!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example of function calling/structured output here is the cleanest example on how function it works behind the scenes, incorporating prompt engineering and JSON schema.With the advent of agents/MCP, the low level workflow has only become more confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I getting slightly different use-cases mixed up, or would it be better if everything just spoke MCP?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451406</guid></item><item><title>16.

There's lots of ongoing stuff in the community, and even huge driver packs for Ryzen hardware.The website that led me down that hole was the one from "spacedrone808" [1] who appeared regularly in /r/windows7 mod posts and issue trackers.There's also the snappy driver installer project [2] which shares a 44GB torrent with all kinds of drivers, from SATA controllers to NIC to GPU. There's also driverpacks which is sometimes down, sometimes not. In the web archive of either of those you can still find the torrent links though.Oh and there's driveroff [4] which led me down the rabbit hole of Russian hacking communities that backport software to win7, which is amazing to see that there's this isolated modding community on the internet that uses hardcore win7 modded variants, with self-built firewall software, backported hash file databases for antivirus tools etc.[1] https://win7sp2.neocities.org/[2] https://sdi-tool.org/[3] https://driverpacks.net/[4] https://driveroff.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/i486girl/win7-sp2/blob/main/LICENSE is pretty rich, given that the whole repo is just a bazillion binary files from Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;God I wish I could replace Windows 11 with Windows 7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43445103</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Joseph Epstein explores the relationship between work and purpose in contemporary society, asserting that the distinction between work as a means to an end and work as a source of personal identity has diminished. Epstein argues that while work can provide structure and a sense of accomplishment, it should not define an individual’s entire existence. He reflects on the cultural shift that has led many to seek a deeper meaning through their professions, often to the detriment of personal fulfillment and leisure. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a balanced approach that recognizes the value of work while also embracing other aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article serves as an introduction to ncurses, a programming library that facilitates the development of text-based user interfaces in a terminal environment. It outlines the library's features, including handling multiple terminal types and providing functions for screen manipulation, color handling, and input management. The introduction also highlights ncurses' portability, allowing programmers to create applications that work across various Unix-like systems. Additionally, it offers insights into its history, development, and core design principles, making it a valuable resource for developers interested in text UI programming.&lt;/p&gt;

You tell it what the screen should look like and it figures out how to efficiently write just the changes needed to achieve that on the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always liked that on SuSE, I had my choice with YaST of either the Ncurses interface or the GUI X Window System.

There are lots of areas in the mountains that have expensive housing. You are allowed to build one 15,000 sqft house but not ten 1,500 sqft houses on the 35 acres. Would love to have something like this in Colorado.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To get this going, we had to buy 1 home, not 6 of themYou had to buy land for six, though?This side of the pond buying (vacant) land to build one family home would run well into six figures (USD $$$,$$$ where the first digit is definitely a 2 and if you're unlucky it's higher still) - then you have to finance the house(s) on top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482005</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gave her the benefit of the doubt initially, she usually posts good posts, but this is not the way to do things. Vagueposting about a security vulnerability without properly disclosing it to the mantainers: (1) damages their reputation, (2) sends every blackhat on the hunt like a real life worldwide CTF event, (3) leaves sysadmins in the dark unless they are following this specific random blog and (4) since the details aren't known even if they know it's impossible to determine if they really are affected.Something like this would be justified if the maintainers were unresponsive and it was a remotely exploitable bug. Now it turns out this is probably a minor thing (local privilege escalation if you happen to be running atop as a privileged user).It seems to me like an irresponsible, egocentric way to handle things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both of the error messages we're given indicate that the "top" chunk of the heap was corrupted, which is a special internal allocation used by glibc malloc to represent any unused capacity from the last time malloc decided to grow the heap:    high memory addresses ("top" of heap)
    | unmapped memory |
    |-----------------|
    |                 |
    |    top chunk    |
    |  (mapped, but   |
    |     not yet     |
    |    allocated)   |
    |                 |
    |-----------------|
    | allocated chunk |
    |-----------------|
    |   freed chunk   |
    |-----------------|
    | allocated chunk |
    |                 |
    |-----------------|
    | allocated chunk |
    |-----------------|
    |   freed chunk   |
    |-----------------|
    |     tcache      |
    |-----------------|
    low memory addresses ("bottom") of heap

That likely indicates a heap buffer overflow. If a call to malloc() doesn't find a freed chunk, it will split the top chunk in two and return a pointer to the bottom portion. If you then write past the end of the returned allocation, you clobber the metadata of the top chunk, and get errors like the ones in the article.With the exploit mitigations built into modern Linux and glibc, it's a lot of work to go from here to arbitrary code execution; but it very well may be possible, depending on exactly how much control the attacker has over what atop does. The attacker can probably trigger the heap buffer overflow multiple times by spawning multiple processes, and if the length and contents of the heap buffer overwrite are attacker-controlled, they can probably play some games to overwrite any data stored in the heap. If that's true, the only thing preventing full arbitrary-code-execution is ASLR; there are many clever ways to get around that, but it's often quite difficult and may or may not be possible here.This year's LACTF had a challenge with essentially this exact setup. My solution writeup is a good example of what it takes to defeat the exploit mitigations and turn a heap buffer overflow into an RCE: https://jonathankeller.net/ctf/lamp/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey guys so I work on a tool call Bismuth along with my co-founder for finding and fixing bugs and we think we have this. At the very least we have a bug in atop which mimics what is being described.We're going to throw this sha down right here: 1d53b12f3bc325dcfaff51a89011f01bffca951db9df363e6b5d6233f23248a5And now we're going to go responsibly disclose what we have to the maintainers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485980</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;Collapse OS is an open-source operating system designed for use in a post-collapse society, emphasizing simplicity, durability, and accessibility. It caters to outdated hardware and enables users to build their own tools and programs for survival. The project focuses on creating a system that can be effectively used with minimal resources, with a strong community-driven approach to documentation and development. The ultimate goal is to empower individuals to maintain and develop technological solutions independently in scenarios where traditional infrastructure may fail.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with claims of imminent societal collapse is they treat "collapse" like an event, with the world neatly divided into before and after. Historically, societal collapse is much more fuzzy. No neat single cause. No single moment when things flipped. You can only truly know the collapse has happened well in retrospect.In terms of computing, this means that any strategy looking at a before/after collapse framing is missing the entire interesting middle part - how do we transition from this high-tech to low-tech world over the course of decades. I seriously doubt it can happen by anticipating what computing we might need and just leapfrogging there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the past couple of years I've worked on a Ghidra extension that can export any subset of a program as a relocatable object file. I built that because I tried to reverse-engineer/decompile a video game and had unconventional opinions on how to proceed about it.I didn't design it for a post-collapse scenario, but one can salvage program parts from binary artifacts and create new programs with it, just like how a mechanic in a Mad Max world can scavenge car parts from a scrapyard and create new contraptions. It deconstructs the classical compile-assemble-link workflow in a manner that tends to cause migraines to sane persons.I've even managed to slightly bend the rules around ABI and sling binary code across similar-ish platforms (PlayStation to Linux MIPS and Linux x86 to Windows x86), but to really take this to its logical conclusion I'd need a way to glue together incompatible ABIs or even ISAs, in order to create program chimeras from just about any random set of binaries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If "our global supply chain [will] collapse before we reach 2030," why is having a some type of computer a priority?I feel these kinds of projects may be fun, but they're essentially just LARPing. Though this one seems to have a more reasonable concept than most (e.g. "My raspbery pi-based "cyberdeck" with offline wikipedia will help!" No, you need a fucking farming manual on paper.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482705</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe twenty years ago, Google Translate had a fun bug with the word "amistad." In Spanish-&gt;English mode, it would correctly translate this to "friendship." If you added an exclamation mark, it would translate with the exclamation mark, so "amistad!" became "friendship!" If you added more, it would add to the translation, so "amistad!!!" became "friendship!!!" Except if you used exactly five exclamation marks, no more and no less, it would translate "amistad!!!!!" to "murder!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I have a better one.I was trying to download some software from a Japanese website (this was about 10 yrs ago I think). There was an entire survey you had to fill out first. Since I speak no Japanese, I naturally used Google Translate (to Polish, not even to English).That survey had a "gender" field, and the options were something like "person" and "woman".Then there are the automatic (mis)translations of button labels and other similar strings in software, where the translating tool often only has a single and ambiguous word to go on, with no context whatsoever.THe funniest ones I've seen are "branch" (satellite office) versus "branch" (of a tree), "book" (a flight) versus "book" (something you read), "character" (ASCII or Unicode) versus "character" (in a story), "clear" (to remove all) versus "clear" (translated as "cloudless", referring to the sky), "letters" (delivered by a postman) versus "letters" (and not digits), "rate" (how fast. i.e. speech rate) versus "rate" (how much you charge per minute), "prune" (remove all) versus "prune" (dried plum), "manual" (and not automatic) versus "manual" (a user manual), "clubs" (places you go to) versus "clubs" (and not diamonds or spades, "queen of clubs" hav a particularly interesting meaning here), "number" (that you call) versus "number" (of things), "at" (@) versus at (home), "tab" (key) versus "tab" (in a browser), "close" (to me) versus "close" (something), "back" (button) versus "back" (a body part), as well as all the "party" (adventuring team in an RPG) versus "party" (legal entity, i.e. "third party") versus "party" (as in an event you have fun at) shenanigans.Mistakes like these often hide in accessibility labels, and are hence far more obvious to screen reader users. In normal UI, they're usually found quickly enough that users never notice, but accessibility labels are often overlooked when testing translations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a similar experience where Dutch surnames were translated from English to Dutch by Excel for some reason. Since many Dutchman have a surname prefixed with the Dutch word "van" (which means "of") Excel dutifully translated it to "Busje", which meant that many of our clients suddenly were called "Lieke Busje Lexmond" or "Vincent Busje Gogh".It got a chuckle from our marketing department which caught the error before badges were printed for the very high-profile event we had planned for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43441880</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;Intel RealSense provides advanced computer vision technology and solutions designed to enable a wide range of applications such as robotics, drones, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence. The site showcases various RealSense camera models, their capabilities, and development tools, facilitating the integration of depth sensing and 3D mapping into user projects. It also offers resources, including SDKs, tutorials, and community support to help developers leverage RealSense technology effectively in various innovative fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 2021 I needed some stereo cameras for an AR experience I was building for the 2020 World’s Fair Expo (yes, it took place in 2021 but was called 2020). We looked into RealSense, and right around when we did there was some news that Intel had either laid off the RealSense team or stopped manufacturing new cameras. Whatever it was, it made us look elsewhere, as it does not seem like Intel is serious about developing/maintaining this product line.We ended up going with the ZED 2i from Stereolabs (https://www.stereolabs.com/products/zed-2). They work pretty well, my only issue was that their skeletal tracking doesn’t work well if you mount them vertically (which is probably a big ask, the other features do work in vertical orientation though, which was good).Stereolabs was pretty active on the software side of things, pushing updates pretty regularly. They’d usually fix a bug within a sprint or two. The hardware is pretty simple, and I find it unsurprising that they’re still selling the ZED 2i at the same price as 4 years ago. It gets the job done, and most of the advancement in the past few years has probably come from throwing more sophisticated AI at the existing stereo video feed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long, long ago the the Kinect came out and it was able to provide 3D imaging for robotics companies at an incredibly good pricepoint compared to everything that came before it.  Then the company that made it created a version with just the 3D sensor and that was even better.But then Apple bought them for what would later become face unlock.  Apple wasn't interested in being a component supplier so they discontinued selling sensors to robotics companies and it was a bad time for robotics companies that had incorporated these into their products.Into this Intel came with RealSense, with better performance in an even smaller form factor.  This was really nice.  Then Intel released a garbled statement about discontinuing RealSense in 2024 and everybody freaked out.  A lot of companies, like the one I was working at, decided this was the time develop and in-house 3D sensor system.Apparently Intel is spinning them out as an independent company, though, so maybe we don't actually have to worry about Intel losing interest and shutting them down.https://www.therobotreport.com/intel-spins-out-realsense-as-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought Intel shut down Realsense years ago. It turns out they didn't exactly, and the D421 module is actually a new product. Apparently they're going to spin it out.https://www.therobotreport.com/intel-spins-out-realsense-as-...$80 is a bargain for that module. I hope they sell them in fewer than 10s though...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452486</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of sharding for PgVector, a PostgreSQL extension that allows for efficient querying of vector data, particularly in machine learning applications. It covers the challenges of scaling vector databases and provides a detailed approach to partitioning the data across multiple PostgreSQL instances to enhance performance and manageability. The author explains the benefits of sharding, including improved query speed and resource utilization, and shares insights on best practices for setting up and maintaining a sharded PgVector environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really dig more content about how vector databases/tools handle problems like this!In sqlite-vec, there's only a flat brute-force index (though DiskANN/IVF will be coming soon). But we do have a concept of partition keys[0], which allows you to "internally shard" the vector index based on a user_id or any other value.   create virtual table vec_documents using vec0(
      document_id integer primary key,
      user_id integer partition key,
      contents_embedding float[1024]
   )

Then at query time, any WHERE constraints on a partition key are pushed-down, so only matching vectors are searched instead of the entire index.  select
    document_id,
    user_id,
    distance
  from vec_documents
  where contents_embedding match :query
    and k = 20
    and user_id = 123; -- only search documents from user 123

Definitely not as performant as a proper vector index, but a lot of real-world application have these natural groups anyway. Like "search only English documents" or "search entries in this workspace only", or even "search comments only from the past 30 days."Internally sqlite-vec stores vectors in "chunks", so when partition keys are definds, every chunk is associated with a unique combination of all partition keys. Kinda hard to describe, but if you create a vec0 virtual table and insert some values, you can inspect the internal "shadow tables" in the SQLite database to see how it's all stored.[0] https://alexgarcia.xyz/sqlite-vec/features/vec0.html#partiti...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will work very poorly when your data is changing because the centroids degrade and you'll have very poor recall but likely not know it unless you are also monitoring recall.I didn't see this in the write-up, so adding it here as a common foot gun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sharding is a bad solution for any databases, especially vector database.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that all clothing, regardless of its production method, is ultimately handmade because it is created through human ingenuity and labor. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing the craftsmanship involved in both artisanal and mass-produced garments, and explores the implications this has for how we view and appreciate clothing. The piece advocates for a deeper understanding of the clothing industry and encourages consumers to value the effort that goes into garment creation, whether it’s produced in a small workshop or a large factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450515"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related: has anyone done a study of inflation in terms of clothing adjusted for quality? This piece notes, for instance, that manufacturers have been reducing thread quality (having exhausted their ability to reduce fabric quality, I suppose) for decades, with major implications for clothing longevity.I’ve long suspected a lot of supposed economic progress since, especially, the 1970s, has just been goods getting worse.Go look at what it costs to get a chambray work shirt (where we got the term “blue collar”, so, made for physical labor, not something fancy) made with similar-quality fabric and construction to a common 1940s or 1950s offering in a Sears catalog. Not the ones J Crew or whoever sells, those are fine for what they are but they’re not built for work, the fabric’s thinner and they lack extensive double- or triple-stitching and other reinforcement.If you find one under $150, please let me know.Similar story for jeans, sweatshirts… everything. Hell, even athletic socks were better-made decades ago.[edit] for reference, a 1930s Sears Hercules work shirt, basically an early model of what I’m writing about above, cost $0.79. Adjusted for official inflation figures? That’s about $18. $18 shirts are almost all terrible now. This is why I suspect there’s some bullshit going on with the metrics, and it involves laundering (ha!) worse goods into alleged improvements in the standard of living. This would also help explain (along with Baumol’s) why some things so consistently outpace nominal inflation: because nominal inflation isn’t capturing reality very well, so when it hits something that can’t (for whatever reason) be made worse, that thing seems to “outpace” inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago I got into the hobby of handmade leather goods, like wallets.One thing that struck me as I learned more about the process was that I could with little training, make a higher quality, hand sewn wallet than even most luxury brands for less money by simply buying more expensive material. Indeed, the wallets I've made are still going strong.What was also apparent was that I certainly had far less skill than the people constructing those mass market wallets. To be able to operate an industrial sewing machine at speed takes far more skill than learning to saddle stitch by hand. When you stitch by hand you can go quite slowly, and taking the time is the point of a hobby anyway. A sewing machine is slightly worse in quality (but not by a lot) but also scales way better.If you watch videos of skilled folks sewing together shoes on youtube it's insanely impressive how precise and practiced those folks are!Back to wallets, most hobbyists will take a very high end and thick piece of leather, cut out the pattern with an exacto knife, skive the parts that need it, hand stitch it with a saddle stitch, then finish the edges. Whereas a mass-produced wallet will often use a blend of leather, synthetic fabric for pocket liners, and be machine stitched, with some other machines used along the way. The hobbyist design is simple and robust, it's just layers of leather thicker than you'd find in a normal wallet.A mass manufactured wallet, even many luxury ones use thinner pieces of leather and synthetic material and construction methods that are less robust. It's not all about cheapness though, some of these things require extra work. I think a lot of it is about producing a product that looks a specific way, even if it is less durable. For instance some luxury products will use a delicate finish (like a paint) that will look awesome, but just won't last as long as a thick piece of vegetable tan. A thin turned edge can certainly be a failure point as well, and that takes more effort to make! I also have to wonder if these brands intentionally want their items to wear out to encourage people to buy more. I imagine the sort of person who buys a Gucci wallet sees it more as a seasonal status symbol than as an investment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About ten years ago, I started garment sewing because it was a superpower.   I could create something that hit two previously exclusive conditions: It fit me properly (tall, long arms) and it was interesting (not the one bland pattern available in my fit).It gave me a respite from the computer, a nice creative outlet, and was very satisfying.  I've made about 140 shirts for myself and others since then, and every one is unique, with wild fabrics not found in any commercial garment.   I very much recommend making things for yourself.The interesting thing is that almost everyone I talk to about it says "you should sell them".   Thing is, it takes me about 2-3 afternoons to make a shirt, plus consumables costs (retail $30-40, wholesale would obviously be lower), and scaling the process basically requires scaling the number of people doing it.So I always respond that I just do it for the benefit of myself, family, and friends, but I have a keen understanding of how much the manufacturers are squeezing costs through labor, materials, and construction techniques to hit that $18 shirt that falls apart in a couple months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450515</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to delete your genetic data from 23andMe, a personal genomics company. It explains the importance of managing personal data privacy, particularly concerning sensitive genetic information. The guide outlines the processes for both deleting an account and requesting the deletion of genetic data, emphasizing the need for users to be informed about their data rights and the implications of retaining such information.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be honest, this is more like "requesting the data to be deleted". There's nothing that guarantees that the personal information will be physically wiped out of the hard drives used to store them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those curious about what actual data they are recording, they use Infinium Global Screening Array which records about 650-750k SNPs (single-nucleotide-polymorphisms) .Obviously this data infers heritage, disease risk, relations.  It could be used for discrimination, surveillance, potentially poisoning .Everyone should request their data to be deleted, but this is an engineering forum, and we know what that means in practice. Every company like this has hundreds of copies of the data, and has shared it with dozens of providers.Like Rev Tevia said, you can't put the feathers back into an opened pillow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels as hopeless as trying to keep your email/contacts from social media sites. Even if you are vigilant about never allowing an app/service to download your contacts, your friends will share theirs and it is trivial to recreate your contact list. If I keep my DNA from these companies, my relatives will share theirs and they basically have my DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486236</guid></item><item><title>33.

But you can also give a great musician a zipper and paper bag and they can make it sound nice.It’s just like LLM generated prose to me. The orchestration and motif development is musical sounding, but there’s these artifacts that are like the “It’s important to consider” or “Would you like further suggestions” of the aural world.I think it would be fun to write up a detailed analysis of a full piece.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452990</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and increasing incidents of human drivers colliding with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the shortcomings of human driving behavior compared to AI systems. It examines the psychological and behavioral factors that lead to such crashes, including distraction and risk-taking. The piece emphasizes the importance of improving driver awareness and education to enhance road safety, especially as autonomous technology continues to advance and integrate onto highways.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious crash rates are a hockey stick pattern. 20% of the drivers cause 80% of the crashes, to a rough approximation. For the worst 20% of drivers, the Waymo is almost certainly better already.Honestly, at this point I am more interested in whether they can operate their service profitably and affordably, because they are clearly nailing the technical side.For example data from a 100 driver study, see table 2.11, p. 29.
https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/37370
Roughly the same number of drivers had 0 or 1 near-crashes as had 13-50+. One of the drivers had 56 near crashes and 4 actual crashes in less than 20K miles! So the average isn't that helpful here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was initially skeptical about self-driving cars but I've been won over by Waymo's careful and thoughtful approach using visual cues, lidar, safety drivers and geo-fencing. That said I will never trust my life to a Tesla robotaxi that uses visual cues only and will drive into a wall painted to look like the road ahead like Wile E. Coyote. Beep beep.Man Tests If Tesla Autopilot Will Crash Into Wall Painted to Look Like Road
https://futurism.com/tesla-wall-autopilot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waymos choose the routes, right?The issue with self-driving is (1) how it generalises across novel environments without "highly-available route data" and provider-chosen routes; (2) how failures are correlated across machines.In safe driving failures are uncorrelated and safety procedures generalise. We do not yet know if, say, using self-driving very widely will lead to conditions in which "in a few incidents" more people are killed in those incidents than were ever hypothetically saved.Here, without any confidence intervals, we're told we've saved ~70 airbag incidents in 20 mil miles. A bad update to the fleet will easily eclipse that impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43487231</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Google's decision to shift the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) development process to a more private model, with the aim of enhancing collaboration and security among contributors. This move may lead to changes in how updates and features are communicated to the public, with a focus on fostering a tighter integration of proprietary elements while still maintaining the open-source ethos of Android. The implications of this transition for developers, manufacturers, and users are explored, particularly concerning access to the project's latest advancements and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This really reminds me of Open Solaris.&gt; We will no longer distribute source code for the entirety of the Solaris operating system in real-timeIn the case of Open Solaris, the code never came out from that point onwards. For Android, the likely end goal is to do the bare minimum of distributing only copyleft code that they don't own copyright to. Until those get replaced with a closed alternative.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=2482s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope they make it closed source and make us much money out of it as possible for shareholders that is their job and their duty, why are they giving this away for free they have already captured market share by claiming opensource and building a community now all they have to do is make it proprietary and the old opensource version slowly wither and become unstable, then they can charge money for the operating system just like mircrosoft but this time on phone millions and billions of phones, $$$$$. /S (I obviously do not agree with this)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm while this could be sold as just to prevent leaks (which occasionally happen), I think this is more likely a first step to closing the source, in light of the EU messing up their open source monetisation strategy.Well, more like the 5th step really. They already moved a ton of functionality into Google Play Services, and discontinued a load of the open source stock apps like Calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484927</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Martin Fowler explores the implications and potential of generative AI in various fields, focusing on how it can enhance software development and other creative processes. It discusses the technology's capabilities in generating code, text, and media, highlighting examples of its use and the importance of human oversight to ensure quality and alignment with user intentions. Fowler emphasizes the ongoing evolution of generative AI and the need for developers and organizations to adapt their practices in response to these advancements while addressing ethical considerations and the limitations of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Cursor for most of my development these days. This article aligns pretty closely with my experiences. A few additional observations:1. Anecdotally, AI agents feel stuck somewhere circa ~2021. If I install newer packages, Claude will revert to outdated packages/implementations that were  popular four years ago. This is incredibly frustrating to watch and correct for. Providing explicit instructions for which packages to use can mitigate the problem, but it doesn't solve it.2. The unpredictability of these missteps makes them particularly challenging. A few months ago, I used Claude to "one-shot" a genuinely useful web app. It was fully featured and surprisingly polished. Alone, I think it would've taken a couple weeks or weekends to build. But, when I asked it to  update the favicon using a provided file, it spun uselessly for an hour (I eventually did it myself in a couple minutes). A couple days ago, I tried to spin up another similarly scoped web app. After ~4 hours of agent wrangling I'm ready to ditch the code entirely.3. This approach gives me the brazenness to pursue projects that I wouldn't have the time, expertise, or motivation to attempt otherwise. Lower friction is exciting, but building something meaningful is still hard. Producing a polished MVP still demands significant effort.4. I keep thinking about The Tortoise and The Hare. Trusting the AI agent is tempting because progress initially feels  so much faster. At the end of the day, though, I'm usually left with the feeling I'd have made more solid progress with slower, closer attention. When building by hand, I rarely find myself backtracking or scrapping entire approaches. With an AI-driven approach, I might move 10x faster but throw away ~70% of the work along the way.&gt; These experiences mean that by no stretch of my personal imagination will we have AI that writes 90% of our code autonomously in a year. Will it assist in writing 90% of the code? Maybe.Spot on. Current environment feels like the self-driving car hype cycle. There have been a lot of bold promises (and genuine advances), but I don't see a world in the next 5 years where AI writes useful software by itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is how I use it: As a writing assistant that lives in my IDE, and as a very very cool and sophisticated rubber duck that can answer me.Something I do quite a lot is throwing back and forth a discussion over a particular piece of code, usually provided with little to no context (because that's my task to worry about), hammering it until we get that functionality correct, then presenting it with broader context to fit it in (or I simply do that part by hand).Here is how I don't use it: As an agent that gets broad goals that he is supposed to fulfill on its own.Why? Because the time and effort I have to invest to ensure that the output of an agentic system is in line with what I actually try to accomplish, is simply too much, for all the reasons outlined in this excellent article.Ironically, this is even more true, since using AI as an incredibly capable writing assistant, already speeds up my workflow considerably. So in a way, less agentic AI empowers me in a way that makes me more critical of the additional time I'd have to invest to play around the quirks of agentic AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developer skill is obviously still essential — you can’t steer if you couldn’t drive. But what about developer energy? Before AI I could only code about 2 hours per day (actual time spent writing code) but with Claude Code I can easily code for 5 hours straight without breaking a sweat. It feels like riding an e-bike instead of a bicycle. AI genuinely feels like Steve Jobs analogy of a bicycle for the mind — it doesn’t replace me but now I can go much farther and faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43480964</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I talked to JP about this project. He's excited in a way that's hard not to catch. His core thesis is simple: coding agents are the future, and the winners will be the ones who can execute.It won’t be OpenAI or Claude. They have other priorities. The real opportunity is for small teams who move fast, stay close to users, and keep ahead of the pack.That makes sense. LLMs are already powerful, almost magical at times. But using them as coding agents still takes real work. They can do amazing things, and be frustrating and make a mess. There are rough edges and big gaps.Those will get fixed. The question is who gets there first.The counterpoint to that would be that all these tools are gonna end up sort of the same and there won't be a way to differentiate.Which way will it play out? I'm not really sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;We want to build for the dream of billions of programmers; billions of artists; billions of scientists—using computing as moldable clay.At that point, why even keep humans in the loop. Just let it exist in the background and generate better ideas than any human would anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini 2.5 seems to be the current king of AI coding. In addition to being "smart", it has a huge context window. The one-shot examples on Twitter are astounding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43483802</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Another common request is to “stop implementing features”.Yes, it's a very common one shared by virtually all Scala 3 developers. Stop. At least for a couple of years.Tooling and the community just can't keep up and the language is very good already that the focus should be on the ecosystem and not language.But Scala devs are beyond deaf and that's what you get when a programming language is an ongoing research project on which many students and professors depend.It's not enough to say "if we stop developing new features the language will die" when there's 0 evidence by it and a huge fatigue towards the relentless development coming from most of the community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scala has been very enjoyable and productive for me and the teams I've worked on. The first couple years of v2 -&gt; v3 transition were a bit rough as the tooling and ecosystem was catching up, but now we happily use Scala 3 with no looking back. The language and ecosystem are evolving in a good direction, and I'm happy to play a small part in that with my open source libraries for Scala.js (which is the entire reason I got into Scala in the first place – so much simpler and safer than Typescript).Scala is perhaps not going to replace Java in every old enterprise, but in my personal experience working for startups, it's been an awesome force multiplier for small teams who need to productively pump out safe and ergonomic code. Finance, health systems, etc. And yet it's also ergonomic and pleasant enough for me to eagerly use it in my non-mission-critical personal projects as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other languages have caught up.Back in the days using Java was mind-numbing boring and boilerplate-galore. Scala offered vastly more productivity and fun. These days Java is... fine. Scala is still amazing but Java doesn't cause active pain anymore. It becomes harder to justify using a niche language.Scala will still live. It is an amazing language with a great combination of functional and OO programming. I just don't see a big breakthrough in popularity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43468972</guid></item><item><title>39.

    I'd like to say that some important last-minute thing came up and delayed things.

    But no. It's just pure incompetence.
    
    Because absolutely nothing last-minute happened yesterday, and I was just clearing up some unrelated things in order to be ready for the merge window. And in the process just entirely forgot to actually ever cut the release. D'oh.

Relatable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm super excited for this! But it makes me curious.What's the process like for getting such a low-level primitive added to Linux? Especially a low-level primitive that 1) exist basically just to emulate behavior of a completely different kernel, and 2) is only needed for a subset of users to play games?I'm not complaining, just curious. I would assume a patch to add the above would be heavily scrutinized.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Hyperlight, a new compiler technology that generates WebAssembly (WASM) code aimed at creating fast, secure, and operating system-independent applications. It highlights the advantages of Hyperlight in enabling developers to build applications that readily run in various environments without being tied to specific operating systems.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started using WebAssembly in earnest a few months ago to make a backend auth library that works in several different languages[0]. It's built on Extism[1], which abstracts away some of the interfacing complexity. It's been an awesome experience. Frequently feels like magic.WASM is in an interesting place. The value has clearly been proved with a pretty minimal core spec. Now there's a big push to implement a much larger API surface for WASI and the Component Model. A lot of people in the community are concerned about this direction, or at least the way it's happening[2].For my part, I hope WASM doesn't go the way of the rest of web browsers where it gets so complicated that only big tech is capable of making implementations and experimenting.[0]: https://github.com/lastlogin-net/decent-auth[1]: https://extism.org/[2]: https://www.assemblyscript.org/standards-objections.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of months ago we announced Hyperlight [1], a lightweight VMM that can spawn new VMs in about a millisecond.Today we’re happy to announce the Hyperlight Wasm guest based on the Wasmtime runtime. This makes it possible to run Wasm Component binaries on top of WASI interfaces without the need for a guest OS in the VM. In this post we explain how this works and walk through an example.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42078476&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really excite about this!  I've got hopes that WASM/WASI will grow into the dream of the JVM from the 90s.  A memory-safe target for development that allows easy of porting and testing across multiple platforms.  WASM can, and hopefully will, be for so much more than browsers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482556</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The Playwright MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) is a collection of tools and libraries that enables developers to leverage the Playwright framework for end-to-end testing of web applications. It facilitates the integration of Playwright with cloud services to enhance testing capabilities, including parallel execution and cloud-based browser management.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so good. I've been using it with Claude Code with great success.I just leave an instruction in CLAUDE.md to validate changes with Playwright. It automatically starts a dev server (wrote a little MCP server to do that), navigates to the page with the changes it just made, and validates that its changes worked. If there is anything unexpected, it self-corrects.It's like working with a really great mid-level engineer.What a time to be alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m going to see if I can use this in combination with our JIRA MCP to read a bug ticket’s “steps to reproduce” to see if it translate those steps to actually reproduce those actions.I don’t understand the hate against MCP. It is truly exciting to see the Cambrian explosion of “connectors” coming out.This is going to be the “App Store” for models in a way that OpenAI’s custom GPTs never was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It uses ariaSnapshot, which is an accessible representation of the DOM used by screen readers and accessibility validation tools as well as playwright testing.However, even with that, it will quickly exhaust the model context if you navigate to something like Gmail. I just verified this with cursor.I've been playing around with a much better textual representation of the page that's much more compact:https://github.com/lxe/chrome-mcp/blob/master/src/runtime-te...This uses your own chrome session and doesn't require a huge context size.I might refactor this to use the aria interface available to the CDP, which I wasn't aware of at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485740</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; it also gives us better density overall by having smaller instructions. x86 can put more work into each instruction byte, so we can have denser binaries and increase performance that way.Is that really true? I was under the impression that ARM core density was better than x86.The first Google result I found agrees: https://www.bitsnbites.eu/cisc-vs-risc-code-density/&gt; It may take a little bit more microarchitectural work for us to account for stronger memory order on the x86 side, but of course the software has to account for the weaker memory ordering on the ARM side. So there are tradeoffs.I don't think this makes sense either since software has to have synchronisation anyway. I don't think much software relies on x86 TSO (intentionally anyway; I'm sure many bugs are covered up by it).Anyway fantastic interview! Very refreshing when they're actually technical with interesting questions and answers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This interview was great! I really wish there were more of these sorts of interviews published.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great interview, more please.
Is there a way to submit question? I'd like to know 1) what affects branch predictors? From my understanding return statements do and cmov does not 2) Why isn't there a conditional exception? to replace if (!cond) { __builtin_trap(); }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464362</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on building a radio receiver, outlining essential components such as antennas, tuners, and amplifiers. It explains the principles of radio wave propagation and reception, detailing various types of receivers and their functionalities. The content includes practical tips on selecting parts, designing circuits, and troubleshooting common issues, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and advanced hobbyists interested in radio technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2023)Very nice. It's not a "crystal radio", though. It's a direct sampling receiver. That is, the processing takes place at the RF frequency directly. Most receivers use heterodyne conversion to down-convert a desired chunk of spectrum to a convenient working frequency. This doesn't. It just runs the raw RF through an A/D.As A/D devices and processing have improved, the frequency upper limit for direct conversion receivers has moved up. There are low-cost direct conversion receivers going up to 50MHz, but they have to use an FPGA rather than doing all the work in software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat project I do wonder what more could be done with the RP2350.Note that the RP2350, being M33 based has square root, and can add 16MB of PSRAM behind the XIP that will help with the flash writing problem, The solder party RP2350 Stamp XL has a SOP8 pad to add PSRAM and is actually shipping for anyone who is looking to play with them, no connection with them, just a user.The extra PIO block would also allow for S2C output which may be nice rather than a TPA2012D2, which will require most people to buy a breakout board anyway.The rp2040/rp2350 series is incredible. The DMA/SIO/PIO features are just so powerful and even the esp32/stm32 seem restrictive to me to go back to.  It is amazing what people are doing with them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool write up!  I'm amazed that it's running on AAA batteries.The introduction to SDR (software defined radio) is much appreciated.Edit:  defined, not designed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452420</guid></item><item><title>44.

Gemini 2.0 Pro and Flash models are really nice. Deep research feature is done really well. Context window is still the best in the industry. Integration with search, gmail, google office suite, google meet, android, etc.They finally have good enough models that lets them leverage their existing portfolio of products, their cloud infrastructure and how embedded they are in the modern work life.Plus, unlike Apple, they are not as restricted in their access to the training data, because of their much less principled privacy stance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the biggest thing Google has working against them is the move to put lightweight models in everything for everyone. Whatever model they use for search is probably somewhere around an ~8B model, and flash 2.0 is decent but still a light weight model.People now associate Google AI/Gemini with shitty search results and bad answers.Meanwhile, their SOTA models have been strong, and Gemini 2.5 looks like it might actually have taken the AI throne yesterday.[1][1]https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43437028</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced a shift in its approach to Android development by making certain aspects of the process private while still maintaining its commitment to open-source releases. This change aims to streamline the development cycle and enhance security, allowing Google to better manage the Android ecosystem while continuing to provide open-source versions of the platform. The article discusses the implications of this decision for developers and the broader Android community, highlighting the balance between confidentiality in development and the benefits of openness in software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

Android is look-but-dont-touch source.
Its massive codebase that requires immense resources to build is not open for negotiation, its existence is to serve Google's whims.Android was already a platform on life support. Google has wielded its authority to dictate how apps should behave such that even 3rd party stores do not stray far from Google's rules. Users of android phones have little hope to run a program from 5 years ago, or to roll back a bad update in an era full of bad updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Android effectively stopped being "open source" when they added Google Play Services. Try running anything on stock AOSP now. Good luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is effectively the "Oracle Solaris" moment of Android, but without changing ownership?Nice. While Android was not open source for a long time, at least it's not openwashed anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485950</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience with using Svelte 5 in production the last few months is that while runes are an upgrade to the magic of previous Svelte versions, it's still too much magic to easily reason about complicated state. This seems like it just adds to the mental overhead. Harris says it's "sacrificing a little bit of purity in service of pragmatic goals" but I don't find it very pragmatic to be debugging glitches, lost reactivity etc which I find myself doing exponentially more as our project grows. The compiler definitely makes simple code snippets look pretty but there was a reason the magic syntax didn't find itself in Vue[1], which in my limited experience has a much more intuitive reactivity model.1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37592471&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agh, I understand why runes were implemented, but I still can't get myself to like them. It feels like Runes take away from what made Svelte Svelte (the simple, concise syntax), and changes like this seem like slow concessions back in that direction anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love runes, I love svelte 5, I love sveltekit.Together, they offer a seamless entry into development, allowing you to swiftly grasp concepts akin to JS/HTML.Other options require a significant learning effort.Wish it came earlier...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43444999</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try talking to them. Try asking them questions about what they think about things and then challenging them to defend it. Above all, try listening to them. Truly listening. Not call and response. Not 3-second wait time followed by “good job” or “well, not exactly.” Students today, like kids always, eagerly seek connections with people, not content. Establish that first and the rest will fall into place.(That’s the good news. The bad news is that our education system, from federal level on down to the individual school board, will readily jump in and agree, but then require metrics and other “measurables” to show that students are cranking out “learning outcomes.” So with the best will in the world, and genuine interest in our kids and their lives as a predicate to meaningful learning in an otherwise highly artificial classroom setting, you as a teacher are stuck banging your head against an immovable concrete wall that gets refreshed annually with million dollar consultant contracts for outsiders who spend two hours every two weeks in your school to tell you what you need to do to reach your students. And at some point, you just say fuck you to all of it.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think China is on the right track here. https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/kid-mode-guidelines/ While I don't like the privacy implications, I like the screen time limits China establishes. Social media and internet must be treated with much care.It's like a candy store open 24/7 - completely free and always within reach. Even adults have a hard time to resist TikTok and YT Shorts and the like.The Internet has changed since I was a kid browsing through GeoCities webrings and the Yahoo Directory while searching with AltaVista. Generations of technology enthusiasts have to acknowledge that the internet of the past is no more and cannot be brought to our children as such.The temptations we faced then were nothing compared to what children today have to resist.Just as many countries regulate advertisements aimed at minors, we need to start regulating screen time for kids - before they get pulled into the vortex of influencers and endlessly accessible, mentally corrosive entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phones should be banned in school. Really that simple. No serious school/parent that cares about the kids' education would allow phones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476365</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents the findings of a survey conducted to assess the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on critical thinking skills among individuals. It explores how AI tools influence reasoning, decision-making, and analytical skills. The survey examines perceptions regarding the benefits and potential drawbacks of AI in educational and professional settings, highlighting concerns about dependency on technology and its effect on cognitive abilities. The results aim to inform strategies for integrating AI responsibly while fostering critical thinking skills in users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good model for understanding what happens to people as they delegate tasks to AI is to think about what happens to managers who delegate tasks to their subordinates. Sure, there are some managers who can remain sharp, hands-on and relevant, but many gradually lose their connection to the area they're managing and become pure process/project/people managers and politicians.Ie. most managers can't help their team find a hard bug that is causing a massive outage.Note: I'm a manager, and I spend a lot of time pondering how to spend my time, how to be useful, how to remain relevant, especially in this age of AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been calling this out since ChatGPT went mainstream.The seductive promise of solving all your problems is the issue. By reaching for it to solve any problem at an almost instinctual level you are completely failing to cultivate an intrinsically valuable skill - that of critical reasoning.That act of manipulating the problem in your head—critical thinking—is ultimately a craft. And the only way to become better at it is by practicing it in a deliberate, disciplined fashion.This is why it's pretty baffling to me when I see attempts at comparing LLMs to the invention of the calculator. A calculator is still used IN SERVICE of a larger problem you are trying to solve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who read only the headline or article:&gt; In this paper, we aim to address this gap by conducting a survey
of a professionally diverse set of knowledge workers ( = 319),
eliciting detailed real-world examples of tasks (936) for which they
use GenAI, and directly measuring their perceptions of critical
thinking during these tasksSo, they asked people to remember times they used AI, and then asked them about their own perceptions about their critical thinking when they did.How are we even pretending there is serious scientific discussion to be had about these "results"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484224</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve only skimmed the paper - a long and dense read - but it’s already clear it’ll become a classic. What’s fascinating is that engineering is transforming into a science, trying to understand precisely how its own creations workThis shift is more profound than many realize. Engineering traditionally applied our understanding of the physical world, mathematics, and logic to build predictable things. But now, especially in fields like AI, we’ve built systems so complex we no longer fully understand them. We must now use scientific methods - originally designed to understand nature - to comprehend our own engineered creations. Mindblowing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back to the "language of thought" question, this time with LLMs :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_thought_hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There needs to be some more research on what path the model takes to reach its goal, perhaps there is a lot of overlap between this and the article. The most efficient way isn't always the best way.For example, I asked Claude-3.7 to make my tests pass in my C# codebase. It did, however, it wrote code to detect if a test runner was running, then return true. The tests now passed, so, it achieved the goal, and the code diff was very small (10-20 lines.) The actual solution was to modify about 200-300 lines of code to add a feature (the tests were running a feature that did not yet exist.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495617</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aside from all the usual and well-deserved high praise I'm seeing, I feel like there's something more worth pointing out:Blender has made 3D work much more "mainstream". I see many videos/pictures/tutorials with views in the millions(!), and much more overall interest in using the software. Not just the pretty visuals and talented people, but the whole program itself seems to be gaining traction with the more "normie" crowd.That also made me realize something else: Blender is now the default for anything that's not extremely high-end/resource-intensive. If you ever hear about anyone doing any kind of 3D work, they're probably using Blender.And this has creeped into the mainstream in a way only very established brands like Coca-Cola have. Nowadays, "Blender" might as well mean 3D photoshop/illustrator for most people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I've never contributed with Blender, I felt proud when I saw "made with Blender" in the credits.Blender is a jewel of the FLOSS movement and a history and behavior that must be mimicked by many other projects.Looking forward to more successes like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Blender 4.4 is all about stability. During the 2024–2025 northern hemisphere winter, Blender developers doubled down on quality and stability in a group effort called “Winter of Quality.”Given the name choice “Winter of Quality”, I’m impressed at the rare cultural and geographical awareness that led to specifying “the 2024–2025 northern hemisphere winter” here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489114</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the artistic technique known as the Piranesi perspective trick, named after the 18th-century artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who was known for his intricate and imaginative depictions of architecture and ruins. The author discusses how this technique creates dramatic, illusionistic views that challenge conventional perspectives and engage viewers' emotions. By employing atmospheric depth, light manipulation, and careful composition, artists can replicate this technique to transport audiences into a captivating world of depth and complexity, enhancing the narrative quality of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll take this opportunity to drop the fact that I'm kind of obsessed with the book "Piranesi", where the main character (named after the artist in the article) survives in a world which is just endless corridors of classical architecture, statues, and staircases.It's an incredibly calming experience, I've listened to the audiobook over 10 times before sleep. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; By legibility I mean that the Piranesi distortion is easier to read, and that to anyone unfamiliar with photographs, that hasn’t grown up with TV, photographs and magazines, the Piranesi version would look much better, and the true perspective would look rather odd.I think this is a key point that people are often unaware of. For instance, whenever I see a modern artist who has painted photorealistic art, I read discussion about how amazing it is that this artist can paint something so perfectly life-like, and the Renaissance artists were clearly inferior, since they couldn't paint with such skill.Besides the obvious discussion about the purpose of art, the other question is whether a photorealistic painting is actually more "lifelike?"Sure, it represents the world exactly the way that a camera sees it, but does it represent the world exactly as we see it? With our human brains we are filling in details, we are focused on the subject of the painting, we are distorting, we are re-mapping shades of color to what we know they ought to be. "Lens blur" in particular isn't remotely the way our eyes perceive the world: our eyes can never roam around the unfocused parts of our own image, rather we ignore the blurry parts unless we specifically try to notice them, and anything we try to focus on becomes sharp.So I appreciate the authors recognition that Piranesi's perspective may indeed be closer to how we perceive the world than "correct" perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panini projection is built into Unity and Unreal. From the documentation from the latter [0] you can see how it's essentially a cropped fisheye-ish projection. That doc also has (in my opinion) a clearer comparison on how the two projections differ, especially looking at the layout of the square tiles on the floor in the first set of pictures.[0] https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43492562</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a challenging software debugging experience faced by a developer, highlighting the complexities and frustrations involved in identifying and resolving a particularly elusive bug. The narrative outlines the iterative process of investigation, the diverse strategies employed, and the ultimate resolution of the issue, emphasizing the importance of persistence, teamwork, and a methodical approach in software development. It serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of coding and the valuable lessons learned through overcoming difficult obstacles in tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(disclaimer: I know OP IRL.)I'm seeing a lot of comments saying "only 2 days? must not have been that bad of a bug". Some thoughts here:At my current day job, our postmortem template asks "Where did we get lucky?" In this instance, the author definitely got lucky that they were working at Google where 1) there were enough users to generate this Heisenbug consistently and 2) that they had direct access to Chrome devs.Additionally - the author (and his team) triaged, root caused and remediated a JS compiler bug in 2 days. The sheer amount of complexity involved in trying to narrow down where in the browser code this could all be going wrong is staggering. Consider that the reason it took him "only" two days is because he is very, _very_ good at what he does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I could recall the details better but this was 20+ years ago now. In college I had an internship working at Bose, doing QA on firmware in a new multi CD changer addon to their flagship stereo. We were provided discs of music tracks with various characteristics. And had to listen to them over and over and over and over and over and over, running through test cases provided by QA management as we did. But also doing random ad-hoc testing once we finished the required tests on a given build.At one point I found a bug where if you hit a sequence of buttons on the remote at a very specific time--I want to say it was "next track" twice right as a new track started--the whole device would crash and reboot. This was a show stopper; people would hit the roof if their $500 stereo crashed from hitting "next". Similar to the article, the engineering lead on the product cleared his schedule to reproduce, find, and fix the issue. He did explain what was going on at the time, but the specifics are lost to me.Overall the work was incredibly boring. I heard the same few tracks so many times I literally started to hear them in my dreams. So it was cool to find a novel, highest severity bug by coloring outside the lines of the testcases. I felt great for finding the problem! I think the lead lost 20% of his hair in the course of fixing it, lol.I haven't had QA as a job title in a long time but that job did teach me some important lessons about how to test outside the happy path, and how to write a reproducible and helpful bug report for the dev team. Shoutout to all the extremely underpaid and unappreciated QA folks out there. It sucks that the discipline doesn't get more respect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting writeup, but 2 days to debug “the hardest bug ever”, while accurate, seems a bit overdone.Though abs() returning negative numbers is hilarious.. “You had one job…”To me, the hardest bugs are nearly irreproducible “Heisenbugs” that vanish when instrumentation is added.I’m not just talking about concurrency issues either…The kind of bug where a reproduction attempt takes a week, not parallelizable due to HW constraints, and logging instrumentation makes it go away or fail differently.2 days is cute though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the various features and functionalities of the Safari web browser, highlighting its strengths in speed, security, and user interface. It explores Safari’s compatibility with various devices and its integration with Apple’s ecosystem, making it a preferred choice for macOS and iOS users. Additionally, the article reviews features such as privacy protections, extensions, and performance optimizations, providing insights into how Safari stands out among competitors in the browsing market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some factual "gaps" there about how good Snow Leopard was, but I understand the sentiment. As someone who's been a Mac user since System 6 and has been consistently using Macs alongside PCs _daily_ for over 20 years I can say that Apple's software quality (either in terms of polish or just plain QA) has steadily decreased.It's just that me and other old-time switchers have stopped complaining about it and moved on (taoofmac.com, my blog, was started when I wrote a few very popular switcher guides, and even though I kept using the same domain name I see myself as a UNIX guy, not "just" a Mac user).For me, Spotlight is no longer (anywhere) near as useful to find files (and sometimes forgets app and shortcut names it found perfectly fine 5 minutes ago), and there is no longer any way to effectively prioritize the results I want (apps, not internet garbage).Most of the other examples in the article also apply, but to be honest I've been using GNOME in parallel for years now and I consider it to be my "forever desktop" if PC hardware can ever match Apple Silicon (or, most likely, if I want something that is _just a computer_).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep being tempted to write same post but named "Does all software work like shit now?", because I swear, this is not just Apple. Software in general feels more bugged as a new norm.Most websites have an element that won't load on the first try, or a button that sometimes needs to be clicked twice because the first click did nothing.Amazon shopping app needs two clicks every now and then, because the first one didn't do what it was supposed to do. Since 3+ years ago at least.Spotify randomly stops syncing play status with its TV app. Been true for at least a year.HBO app has subtitles for one of my shows out of sync and it has been for more than a year.Games including AAA titles need few months post-release fixing before they stabilize and stop having things jerk themselves into the sky or something.My robot vacuum app just hangs up forever once in a while and needs to be killed to work again, takes 10+ seconds after start to begin responding to taps, and it has been like that for over 2 years of owning the device.Safari has had a bug when opening a new tab and typing "search term" too quickly, it opens URL http://search%20term instead of doing a Google search. 8 years ago I've opened a bug for that which was closed as a duplicate, and just recently experienced this bug again.It really seems that criteria for "ready for production" is way lower now. If my first job 13+ years ago any QA noticed any of that above, the next version wouldn't be out until it is fixed. Today, if "Refresh" button or restarting the app fixes it, approved, green light, release it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm done with macOS, I've migrated to Linux for my general purpose computing. With every new release of macOS, Gatekeeper is becoming harder and harder to bypass, increasing Apple's control over what software can be run on macOS, forcing apps to be signed with an Apple Developer ID. While I'm happy they are taking security seriously, I'm seriously creeped out that macOS sends hashes of every executable I run to their cloud. It's starting to feel like a broader move away from the openness of personal computing and towards a more controlled, appliance-like software experience.When Sequoia eliminated the ability to override Gatekeeper by control-clicking, it became clear to me that Apple is now employing a frog boiling strategy towards their ultimate goal -- more control of the software you can run on their hardware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498984</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the findings of Google's Project Zero team regarding vulnerabilities in the WebP image format. It details the identification of multiple security issues that could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The post emphasizes the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities to enhance web security and encourages developers to update their software to mitigate risks associated with WebP.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels so ridiculous to me that a total stranger can send an iMessage message to me, including some attachment, and my phone will process that message in the kernel.How hard would it be for apple to have a setting of "Only receive messages from mutual contacts", and require the stranger to first "request to be added to contacts" (a message which is tightly controlled, and obviously doesn't include a pdf file or webp or whatever), and have the apple imessage server drop all other messages from them until I accept.Signal has "message requests". iMessage doesn't have "message requests", and receives messages in a unique path which goes through the kernel.Like, sure the attacker could hit my Mom with a wrench and iMessage me a PDF exploit that way, but I feel like requiring physical access to one of my contact's phones raises the bar significantly over the current state of affairs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This exploit is just wild. There are just so many little tricks connected together - using multiple image files with unexpected formats, aligning heap chunks to sit on easily-predicted and manipulable addresses, deserializing a huge object graph from image metadata, the usual NSExpression insanity, PAC bypass via unsigned pointers to function-pointer-containing structures, etc. etc. I thought the last exploit (where they built an entire virtual CPU out of image decompression commands: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-i...) was crazy, but that involved a lot fewer "tricks" than this exploit.Many of these tricks are non-public, meaning that NSO would have had to spend a huge amount of time and effort researching every single one of these. They probably have many more tricks they know about and haven't used. And, Apple could patch every one of them in a future update and roll back all of that work.There's a good reason why these exploits are expensive and only sent to a limited number of high-value targets. NSO this time around also worked to "protect their IP" using encryption to hide part of their exploit chain, presumably in a bid to avoid losing yet more of their precious zero-days to researchers.What they're doing is pretty gross (particularly the whole spying-on-journalists bit), but you have to admit the level of technological sophistication and persistence here is pretty impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NSO Group are a terrorist group for hire. This 0-click, 0-day exploit was found targeting civil society. Any one can pay to target journalists, NGOs, politicians. This is why open-source is paramount to security, and having code out in the open.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493056</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;Apple Music has launched a feature called DJ, which allows subscribers to create and mix their own music sets. This new tool enhances the user experience by providing an interactive way for users to engage with the platform's extensive library of songs, enabling them to create personalized playlists and mixes for various occasions. The initiative aims to appeal to both casual listeners and aspiring DJs by offering a creative outlet within the app.&lt;/p&gt;

I use it to make a monthly personal mixtape, which is a nice way to remember what I used to listen to. They call it a "DAW for DJs," which is accurate.I especially admire the team that makes it. The CEO records demo videos that are so filled with enthusiasm and accessible expertise that you can't help but appreciate the product more each time you watch them, and the COO sends out email announcements that are actually useful and not spammy.It's a niche product, but they fill that niche well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m the developer of Transitions DJ (https://dj.app/). If anyone can connect me with the team at Apple Music, I would be interested in doing an integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Im a little confused, if I wanted to create a mix with my favorite parts of songs, is this something I can do relatively easily from Apple Music? Or do I need to get additional hardware or buy some extra software?I love a lot of jam bands, but dont always want to listen to the uhhh lengthy preambles and wandering postludes, just want the gravy. Would love to mix together some highlights along with other non jam songs. Also think my wife and daughter would appreciate Phish more if it wasnt just so. much. phish.Or is this different?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489271</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "tiny undo stack" as a method for implementing undo functionality in applications. It explores the benefits of managing state changes efficiently and introduces a lightweight way to track changes without the overhead associated with more complex undo management systems. The author provides examples and insights into how this simple approach can enhance user experience by allowing quick reversion of actions. Ultimately, the piece emphasizes the value of an intuitive and performance-oriented method for managing undo operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2016 I was frustrated by vscode vim mode undo/redo stack: when you activated undo it would process each individual character insertion/deletion event in sequence exactly as you typed it, e.g. if you type and delete the same character 100 times it would replay that exact sequence even if it was all one logical INSERT. Replay speed was slow enough (maybe 15-20 changes per second?) that it was excruciating to use.So I rewrote it and added logic to merge adjacent changes [1] which helped immensely, enough that undo/redo felt instant again. It looks like the core merging logic was rewritten a few years ago [2] (which caused a regression, is imo less readable, and removed useful comments -_-) but the basic idea is still there today.[1]: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/commit/0576f199cb7a765efb3c...[2]: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blame/v1.29.0/src/history/h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In reality, you're gonna quickly run into battles with state's that are complex and unclonable - in flight fetch requests, circular references, webasm modules that have internal state, etc.Then there are things where the browser already implements undo functionality like navigation (back button) and editing text boxes.   Your undo is going to have to work nicely with those.You'll either end up with a buggy undo implementation, or end up spending a lot of engineering time hunting corner cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my C code, I implement undo/redo using write protection (mprotect).First you mark all of your app memory as read only, so that you can define a SIGBUS handler when attempts are made to write to it.Then when you detect a write to a page in the app memory, you append a copy of that page's memory to a stack, and then mark the page as writeable so that the page can be updated.Then undo is simply a matter of popping the stack and overwriting the app memory with the copy stored on the stack entry.This means you don't have to explicitly write "actions" for everything you want to undo/redo. All in-memory actions are handled automatically.Obviously this means that things like FS changes or network IO changes aren't captured, but sometimes that's fine, and I'm sure there's a way to extend this scheme to handle those things somehow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43458738</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the proper usage of the em dash and en dash in writing. It highlights that the em dash, which is longer, is often used to create emphasis, indicate interruptions, or set off elements within a sentence, while the en dash, slightly shorter, is typically used to indicate ranges of numbers or connect related terms. The article provides examples and tips on how to effectively employ these punctuation marks to enhance clarity and style in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an easy, if not always precise way to remember:* Hyphens connect things, such as compound words: double-decker, cut-and-dried, 212-555-5555.* EN dashes make a range between things: Boston–San Francisco flight, 10–20 years: both connect not only the endpoints, but define that all the space between is included. (Compare the last usage with the phone number example under Hyphens.)* EM dashes break things, such as sentences or thoughts: 'What the—!'; A paragraph should express one idea—but rules are made to be broken.Unicode has the original ASCII hyphen-minus (U+002d), as well as a dedicated hyphen (U+2010), other functional hyphens such as soft and non-breaking hyphens, and a dedicated minus sign (U+2212), and some variations of minus such as subscript, superscript, etc.There's also the figure dash "‒" (U+2012), essentally a hyphen-minus that's the same width as numbers and used aesthetically for typsetting, afaik. And don't overlook two-em-dashes "⸺" and three-em-dashes "⸻" and horizontal bars "―", the latter used like quotation marks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AFAIK most computer keyboards don't have em dashes.  Rather than hit ALT+0151 every time, I've always just strung along two hyphens, like: --Absolutely proper and correct use of em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens is, to me, the most obvious tell of the LLM writer.  In fact, I think that you can use it to date internet writing in general.  For it seems to me that real em dashes were uncommon pre-2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only problem with correctly using the Em or En dash is that people will automatically assume the text was written by an LLM -_-&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497719</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has done a lot of work with agentic coding I am not sure specialized agents are the best solution.  I think standardizing knowledge packs would be better that any agent can read to understand a domain or library is more useful.  In particular this allows for an agent to know multiple domains at the same time.Basically knowledge packs could be specified in each npm package.json or similar.And we should view a knowledge pack as just a cache in a way.  Because agents these days are capable of discovering that knowledge themselves, via web browsing and running tests, it is just costly to do so on every agent run or for every library they don't know.I sort of view specialized agents as akin to micro services, great if you have perfect domain decomposition, but likely to introduce artificial barriers and become inconvenient as the problem domain shifts from the original decomposition design.I guess I should write this up as blogpost or something similar.EDIT: Newly written blog post here: https://benhouston3d.com/blog/crafting-readmes-for-ai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I have trouble understanding what this is doing other than maybe some fine-tuned prompts tailored to a specific stack? I'm looking at the data science kit and I don't see why anyone would use this, much less pay for it?I guess you guys have some MCP connections too, but this seems like such a marginal value add (how often am I really pinging these services and do I really want an agent doing that).Regardless congrats on the launch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the launch! I think this is totally the right next level abstraction for AI-assisted coding. Don’t generate everything from scratch but make it easy to plug in the tools you care about and make the generation way more accurate. Way to go!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43494427</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the recently discovered flow of fluid within the brain, highlighting its potential significance for understanding brain health and disease. Researchers have identified a system of channels through which cerebrospinal fluid circulates, potentially influencing the removal of toxins and the delivery of nutrients in the brain. This fluid flow could play a crucial role in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, and understanding its mechanisms might open new avenues for therapeutic interventions. The study underscores the complexity of brain function and the importance of fluid dynamics in maintaining neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several years, ago I started getting cough headaches. The symptoms were just like it sounds: when I coughed, I got a headache, usually lasting for a few minutes. In addition, bending down caused a sharp pain in my head. Lying down was fine, indeed, all symptoms lessened or disappeared after a good night's sleep and got progressively worse as the day went on.My neurologist diagnosed it as a cough headache, but he cautioned that nobody knows the root cause.He did say that it had to be physical/mechanical, in the sense that it had to be some fluid (or lack of fluid) that caused a problem depending on your orientation (bending down) or when shocked (coughing).He suspected it had to do with spinal fluid and he ordered tests, but they all came back normal. He said that in most patients the symptoms go away after several years, and that's what happened with me.But reading this article, I wonder if there is some connection here. The headaches started when my second child was born and I wasn't getting much sleep. Maybe, as the article theorizes, lack of sleep caused the fluid in my brain to not drain properly or not be cleaned or something. That could be why sleep decreased the symptoms. Maybe they should study cough headache sufferers and compare against normal people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in the neurotech/sleeptech space developing slow-wave enhancement technology.Previous studies have looked at how increased slow-wave activity (delta power - a measure of the synchronous firing of neurons which define deep sleep) effects the removal of amyloid and other metabolic waste from the brain[1].As I work with closed-loop stimulation, not pharmaceuticals, I wasn't familiar with the connection between norephedrine and slow-wave sleep, and my quick search has not cleared up how this researcher made that connection - as the counter argument in the article states.If you're curious about slow-wave enhancement and improving the restorative function of the brain, you can find out more on our website https://affectablesleep.com[1]https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/52/12/afad228/750330...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find that even a quite brief nap (on the order of one to three minutes) is still tremendously refreshing. Is this enough time for this fluid dynamic under study to gear up and get some flushing done ? Or would it be some other mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489136</guid></item><item><title>14.

If the training data is full of human bias, then the predictions will also be full of human bias, and then the outcomes will be full of human bias, and when those outcomes are copraphagically fed back into the training data, you get new, highly concentrated human/machine bias.”https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#go...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across a fascinating Microsoft research paper on MedFuzz (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/medfuzz-explor...) that explores how adding extra, misleading prompt details can cause large language models (LLMs) to arrive at incorrect answers.For example, a standard MedQA question describes a 6-year-old African American boy with sickle cell disease. Normally, the straightforward details (e.g., jaundice, bone pain, lab results) lead to “Sickle cell disease” as the correct diagnosis. However, under MedFuzz, an “attacker” LLM repeatedly modifies the question—adding information like low-income status, a sibling with alpha-thalassemia, or the use of herbal remedies—none of which should change the actual diagnosis. These additional, misleading hints can trick the “target” LLM into choosing the wrong answer. The paper highlights how real-world complexities and stereotypes can significantly reduce an LLM’s performance, even if it initially scores well on a standard benchmark.Disclaimer: I work in Medical AI and co-founded the AI Health Institute (https://aihealthinstitute.org/).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A surprisingly high number of medical studies will not include women because the study doesn't want to account for "outliers" like pregnancy and menstrual cycles[0].

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool.  I’m the CEO of Innerscene (https://innerscene.com) and we make a commercial artificial skylight that uses some of these concepts.  Actually the coelux ht25 model is almost identical to what you made but using smaller lenses and more LEDs - however the effect they were able to achieve still isn’t that great, the sun looks like a giant orb and once you get a few feet away you can make out a sun at all.  We spent a lot of time working on perfect collimation and hiding lens edges and making sure the view into the sky was seamless and artifact free.  I’d say the last 10% of that problem is 90% of the work. :). I think we successfully cracked the nut but currently using a lot of expensive parts so working on brining the cost down. If you search Innerscene patent many of our approaches are spelled out.  We also spent a lot of time on simulation and software…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, the problem with this setup (and with most high efficiency LED lights) is the lack of red wavelenghts.  Real sunlight has a substantial amount of energy in the very red end of the visible spectrum (700 nm) and also of course quite a bit in the infrared.  These lamps have two spectral peaks: a narrow peak in the blue range, around 450 nm, a broader peak in the green, centered around 580 nm.  That greenish peak falls off sharply, and has almost no energy in the red end.The color sensitive cones in our eye have three peaks of sensitivity, the S cones in the blue range, the M cones in the green, and the L cones in yellow.  The L cones are what your brain uses to see red colors, but they are actually pretty insensitive to deep reds like 700 nm.  That’s why you THINK that LED lamps produce red, because they stimulate your L cones, but they do so without actually emitting much red energy at all!Our bodies are sensitive to deep red light.  The cytochrome in our mitochondria respond to it.  There’s an experiment where shining red lights on the skin improved sugar metabolism.  That makes sense, because we naked apes evolved under red-rich sunlight.So these lamps may look like sunlight, but they’re missing some crucial wavelengths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw "artificial sunlight" and thought "oh wow I'd love to see the spectrogram of the lighting solution this person came up with". I was disappointed to merely see "CRI 95+".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH_owRxupC0This is great video on the shortcomings of "CRI" - it explains in detail CRI, CRI extended, TLCI, TM-30, and SSI.Brightness and color temperature are only two small parts of lighting - more people should start investigating the utility of taking their own spectroscopy measurements to figure out what lighting works best for them personally. My friends have very, very diverse opinions on what spectral distributions they like/hate, but they lack the language and experience to identify or communicate their preferences except for "Ooh I like/hate this bulb".I mostly use LED bulbs to keep heat generation down (I pay for the heat twice in Houston: once to generate it and again for the A/C to negate it). But I always mix in a bit of incandescents / halogens (2400-3000K) which provide full-spectrum blackbody radiation to see ALL the wonderful colors in my world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497394</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be better to not confront potential users with a long text about unix history, nobody has time to read that. Instead just write a few bullet points about what it actually does.However, I am very happy somebody finally put the prompt on TOP of a terminal window, since years I am wondering why people like to bow their head to the bottom of the screen.I guess it is the expected gesture for IT devs and admins nowadays to follow and bow your head, so this is a great help for people to understand what is the right posture in life!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like it's getting harder to tell what dagger is _actually_ for these days.At first we'd hoped it could replace jenkins - it provided an alternative way to run and debug CI pipelines - right on your machine! You could write in golang and just import what you needed. The dev direction feels more scattered now, trying to replace docker, be a new shell(?), and weirdly trying to be some kind of langchain?  Doing something different doesn't imply better. A new set of complicated CLI args is no better than what we started with (shell scripts, or jenkinsfiles to integrate docker builds). I'm a little bummed that the project has seemingly drifted (in my view) from the original mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool, I often find myself composing together a mixture of Dockerfiles and shell scripts for various images (build X Dockerfile for Y arch, save it as a base, build Z Dockerfile on top of the last thing, with W args). And then having to run it different ways with different mounts, based on if you're on a developer machine/robot/CI, running as a service/adhoc/attaching. This _looks_ like it could solve some of that messiness. I like that it can just reference the output of a build without having to muck around with tags (which are system global and can collide if you're not careful).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486881</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its just people. People are the same everywhere, and are fundamentally unpredictable systems. How large groups behave does depends to a certain extent on context: by compared to others and your socio-economic situation. How they publicly expressed their values are entirely different from their behavior. This is to the dread of incumbent governments and pollsters.If you starve a wealthy man for 2 weeks he will be ready to cannibalize. If you create a metric upon which you place a lot of economic-value, soooner or later it will get gamed and corrupted. If you remove checks and balances humans being unpredictable will turn on each other.One can choose to ignore this fact, but at the cost of endless grief to oneself and those around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the third world, corruption is very open from the clerk in a local revenue office to the top ministers/secretaries. There is a price for every service.In the West, it is hard to see low-level corruption (bribes for services) in offices. However, corruption takes form in the shape of collusion; and this collusion is pretty much legal. Revolving door, consultants, lobbyists, conflicts of interests, setting up NGOs to grab money from the govt, offering sinecure jobs like advisors, directors, etc for friends and family--these are some strategies to do unethical yet legal stuff in the West.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm fully aware that Sweden and Denmark are different countries (I lived in Denmark for 3 years), but this reminded me of the reel of Swedes playing every time I visit IKEA, where they talk about how corruption is absolutely unthinkable in Swedish society.And there's also this tidbit from the article:&gt; Other Scandinavian nations also reeled upon watching The Black Swan. After the series premiered in Sweden, a criminologist at Lund University warned: “There’s a lot of evidence that it’s probably even worse here.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493159</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Take Oncall and Shove It" discusses the challenges and frustrations associated with being on-call as a software engineer. It highlights the impact on work-life balance, mental health, and job satisfaction, urging employers to reconsider the demands placed on engineers. The author shares personal experiences and suggests that on-call duty should be restructured to support both employees' well-being and company productivity, advocating for better communication and more balanced workloads. The piece ultimately calls for a reassessment of on-call practices in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What they don't tell you about working for yourself is the fact you can be effectively on-call 24x7 every day. I am currently supporting four wineries that are processing thousands of tonnes of receivals 24x7. It happens for two months of the year and I am expected to be available from 06:00 to 22:00 during that time, there is no phoning in sick or having a lazy day, I work alone and only have one reputation. I don't want to be that contractor forever known for destroying a clients business.You can only do this for so long though, when two or three problems come in simultaneously it can cause issues as you drop something halfway through when something more important comes in. I once executed an SQL update query without a where clause under this kind of pressure, and ended up working until the next morning to recover, only to start again at 6AM. I have even had land-line calls at 2AM to bypass my mobile restrictions. The rewards are great, but don't let anyone tell you it is always easy.My current system is 16 years old now and I know all the ins and outs so it has been pretty easy to keep on top of things the last several years, however I am glad the replacement system is nearly written and it will be somebody else problem in 2026.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For "non-exempt" employees, that's paid "stand-by time" California.[1] Also see this case involving on-call coroners.[2]The way this works in most unionized jobs is that there's a stand-by rate paid for on-call hours, plus a minimum number of hours at full or overtime pay, usually four, when someone is called to duty. This is useful to management - if the call frequency is too high, it becomes cheaper to hire an additional person.[1] https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/CallBackAndStandbyTime.pdf[2] https://casetext.com/case/berry-v-county-of-sonoma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent article. I can relate to a lot of it. The sad part is that we can't even control the quality of the systems we're oncall for. We're pushed by management for new features, not for robustness of the tools. Also some systems have no clear ownership, so nobody has an incentive to fix them. It'll be next oncall's business. Oncall is really the worst part of my job. I can stand long hours but this is something else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498213</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a German native speaker, it's surprisingly hard to read the code examples. Seems like all common concepts of programming languages like access modifiers, types etc. are hardwired to their English terms in my brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horrible idea, but I am not surprised someone decided to do this. In Germany employees have guarantee that they can speak German at work, does not matter the company is international, on the meetings, emails are people from USA, India, Ukraine, Poland. German has to be used if a single German employee wants that.I have a friend who works in such place. DeepL is a most important piece of software he uses, the problem starts if DeepL messes up some details. Meetings are a nightmare, communication is a nightmare. Managers try to mitigate all that, by avoiding employees from Germany in the projects, what is pretty funny, as company is multinational, but of German origin, and most of the managers are Germans...This attitude is just one of the many factors that led to https://www.amazon.pl/Kaput-German-Miracle-Wolfgang-Munchau/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm... if you are going to use only Bavarian paraphernalia to symbolize "German Rust", you might as well go all the way and use Bavarian instead of German for some extra laughs? Ok, TBF most programming keywords are rather scientific, and dialects are less used in academia, so that might be tricky.Also, I would bet that most Germans would also use "fn" as a two-letter shorthand for "Funktion". But it just had to be different, so they chose "fk" for "FunKtion"...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43488490</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use bog-standard zsh without any plugins or any of the fancy stuff, but one of the most useful tricks I use is to leverage interactive comments. If I have a long command I know I run will frequently, I 'tag' them at the end by a shell comment[1].So for example, I have one that I use to run software updates:    softwareupdate --include-config-data --install --all --restart # system:update:restart

I have a similar one without the `--restart` option that I tag with `:norestart` instead, but you get the idea—I put related commands under a common term.Then I can just use the ctrl-r builtin keybinding, type `:system` and cycle through system related commands, or go exactly to the command I want. The beauty of this is that it also works in bash and systems I remote into (which I frequently need to do at work), without any extra plugins required.[1]: interactive comments are disabled by default in zsh, but can be enabled with `setopt interactive_comments`&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Atuin and like it a lot, and sync history across hosts.However, the fuzzy search in Atuin is worse than fzf, which was a downgrade. It just has less effective heuristics/scoring, e.g. it might find the individual letters of a short command scattered in a command that had a long base64 input or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have my own solution that I've been using for many years — I record all my bash history.Bash has a hook (cannot remember the name on my phone) that is called on every command.It's easy enough to write into a file the command together with the directory and git branch.Then I can grep it with a bash function that colors the dir and branch in the output.It does not replace ctrl-r but it's a great addition especially when running multiple sessions and bash saving just the last one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470206</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of embracing a mindset of abundance in housing policy and urban development. It argues that to effectively address the housing crisis and promote equitable living conditions, communities must shift from scarcity-based thinking to a focus on creating and maintaining abundant housing options. The piece emphasizes the need for policy changes, inclusive growth strategies, and a collaborative approach among stakeholders to foster an environment that enables the construction of more affordable and diverse housing. Ultimately, the message centers on the necessity of proactive efforts to manage and enhance urban living spaces to benefit all residents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've grown a little bit more skeptical of what can realistically be achieved by the passive nature of YIMBY-ism.In Portland, they passed some radical new zoning laws a few years ago that allowed anyone, anywhere the ability to zone ADUs on their property. And the cost to get permits is almost nothing.I have lots of friends and family in the area with property. But not a single one has added an ADU. It seems like it should be a no-brainer, so I'll bring up and ask why not? And there are basically two reasons:- There's a general fear of being a landlord. Tenants have a lot of legal rights, and the risk of inviting someone onto your property who could start squatting or doing drugs and not being able to evict them is beyond the pale for most families.- They don't need the money. If you can afford a home in the area, you're already pretty well off. Even though adding a rental could be pretty lucrative, there's just not enough motivation to go through with it.To me it has little to do with incumbent politicians and everything to do with the incumbent middle class. I'm all for removing red tape and restrictions, but we also need to come up with incentives to light a fire under the butts of individual actors in our economy to actually go out and make things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of getting tangled up in social issues, liberal politicians should be prioritizing housing, infrastructure and government services supporting people's economic activity of all kinds.Delivering better lives for people, and having the courage to stand up to vested interests, from house owners to corporations, would create a huge and lasting political win across a broad section of the electorate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author has it quite backwards, at least as it comes to housing.Politicians are beholden to the members of their district, not would-be members. Sure, more affordable housing would benefit many people, but it wouldn't benefit the members of the district, particularly the wealthy and powerful, since more affordable housing is very nearly equivalent to real estate values decreasing (at the very least, as perceived by voters). Sure, renters would in theory benefit, but real estate prices aren't rental rates, and the renters have to move to capture the improvement in pricing, often outside of the district.Essentially, the status quo of real estate pricing always increasing in a district serves everyone within the district well enough. Any change to that is a massive financial risk to property owners, so it will be vigorously opposed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495644</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of dynamic dispatch in Rust, a programming language known for its focus on performance and safety. It explains how dynamic dispatch allows for flexibility in method calls, enabling the selection of which method to invoke at runtime rather than compile time. The author discusses the underlying mechanisms of dynamic dispatch, including trait objects and the use of `Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt;`, providing examples and code snippets to illustrate how it works. Additionally, the article compares dynamic dispatch with static dispatch, emphasizing the trade-offs involved, such as performance implications and use cases for each approach. Overall, it serves as a tutorial for understanding and effectively using dynamic dispatch in Rust programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that this post is 8 years old, and some things have moved on since then.In particular, trait object upcasting is on beta now and will be promoted to stable in a couple of weeks.  I know that there has also been active development towards enabling multiple-bound trait objects, but I don't know what the status of that effort is.The article also makes the (quite understandable) mistake of conflating a fat pointer to a trait object with the trait object itself.  In Rust, trait objects are "unsized", which means they can only exist behind some kind of pointer.  And any pointer in Rust that targets an unsized type grows an additional metadata field (for trait objects, a vtable pointer).  This is a slightly weird behavior with a few unexpected consequences that often catches people off-guard, but understanding it is key to understanding why you can't make a trait object for something like `Clone`, which returns an instance of itself-- Because unsized types can't appear on their own, the return type of the `clone()` method would be invalid.For a more thorough take, I recommend "A tour of `dyn Trait`" ( https://quinedot.github.io/rust-learning/dyn-trait-overview.... )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to when Rust gets1. erased types (have to use behind pointer, so not shallow dynamic sizing)
2. Existential typesSo we can build vtables by hand.Type safe API to any OOP ABI + tons of stuff OOP people never imagined....let's go!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trait upcasting will land in Rust 1.86.0 which will be released in one week: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/134367&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43455698</guid></item><item><title>32.

Woz saved a few chips that way.)That is to say, there are no hardware sprites.The fastest way to clear the display is an unrolled loop in the form of LDA #0, STA $2000, STA $2001, STA $2002 etc.  That works out to about 30,000 cycles which takes 30 milliseconds.  A more plausible operation - displaying a whole-screen bitmap by copying it from another location in RAM to the framebuffer using a loop with indexes - weighs in at several hundred thousand cycles, or an appreciable fraction of a second.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. I'll have to get an emulator up and running to try it.Another wild one (back port?) was a small run a guy did for the Nintendo. Here's one on eBay for example: https://www.ebay.com/itm/186125162930&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone wanting to build sprite type code on the Apple II, you really should read this article in Byte magazine:Preshift-Table Graphics on your Apple
by Bill Budge, with Gregg Williams and Rob Moore. A23
Move blocks of pixels across the screen with only 3K bytes of overheadIt's kind of hard to find, it's in the December 1984 Byte magazine, but an additional magazine at the end of the PDF, Bytes Guide to Apple.At the time this was huge, Bill Budge was probably the most well known game programmer, so getting a look inside how he wrote code was a big thing.Of course, as mentioned elsewhere, graphics is hard on the Apple II because of the complex memory layout due to Woz wanting to save a few chips. This can be contrasted with the Atari and Commodore computers that had custom chips that made graphics a lot easier.https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1984-12/page/n397/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43491977</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the philosophy of coroutines, a programming concept that allows functions to pause execution and resume later, enabling cooperative multitasking. It discusses the historical context and evolution of coroutines, compares them with traditional threading models, and highlights their advantages, such as simpler code and improved readability. The author reflects on the implications of using coroutines in software design, emphasizing the need for a clear understanding of control flow and state management. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a thoughtful approach to leveraging coroutines in programming to enhance efficiency and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I share the author's enthusiasm for coroutines. They're nice abstractions for all sorts of state-machine-like code and for concurrency (without parallelism).&gt; You could allocate a piece of memory for a coroutine stack; let the coroutines on it push and pop stack frames like ordinary function calls; and have a special ‘yield’ function that swaps out the stack pointer and switches over to executing on another stack. In fact, that’s not a bad way to add coroutines to a language that doesn’t already have them, because it doesn’t need the compiler to have any special knowledge of what’s going on. You could add coroutines to C in this way if you wanted to, and the approach would have several advantages over my preprocessor system.In C minicoro is a nice library that provides just that: https://github.com/edubart/minicoroIn Zig there's zigcoro: https://github.com/rsepassi/zigcoroAnother source I found enlightening on coroutines is "Coroutines in Lua": https://www.lua.org/doc/jucs04.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been fascinated by coroutine code for ages – this was a great read.For one of the best work projects I’ve done, I used Redux-Saga. It was so elegant for a heavily live-updating ui app. Using coroutines for making API requests, watching sockets, sending and receiving updates, and reacting to data conflicts felt so natural and all just came together so beautifully.The term he uses for “turning functions inside out” is spot on for how they feel. In particular, the way a good coroutine only focuses on the pure state, while being independent of side effects and even time itself really expanded my view of code. It made testing and reasoning about logic so much easier too. It’s a model I really wish was more widespread in languages and the industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently updated: [Simon Tatham, initial version 2023-09-01, last updated 2025-03-25]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495785</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe something worth exploring, run it like an inverted generational garbage collector.Separate the problematic domains and run them in a lower priority background crawl; then do the opposite as well, have a higher priority list for crawling sites that have regular updates more often, based on their last update gap.Basically like a generational garbage collector but in this case it's generational content collector, although arguably, still mostly garbage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you running into those autogen crawler labyrinths that have been posted about recently? Certainly the .edu and .gov ones are probably just huge sites.Am I correct in assuming you are recrawling your entire corpus to get fresh results? Would there be a downside to replacing crawl epochs with a continuous crawl that is random but with age priority?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493207</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article analyzes censorship practices on Amazon.com, highlighting how the platform manages and controls content visibility. It discusses various methods of censorship, including the removal of products, de-listing of books, and the impact of algorithms on what users can access. The analysis draws attention to the implications of these practices for free expression and the broader consequences for authors, creators, and consumers in the digital marketplace, urging for greater transparency and accountability from Amazon regarding its content moderation policies.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything else does not really matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497264</guid></item><item><title>36.

As PHP becomes less popular, and the same/similar vulnerabilities remain, I realise it's more just bad practices (though ~2000-early 2010s PHP really was pretty rough when it came to creating those holes, but that might just be a function of how popular it was!)Nice work on finding it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43466355</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because copper is no longer a good enough conductor when it it is used in very thin layers, the latest and densest CMOS fabrication processes have begun to replace copper with other metals for the first 2 metal layers, which are the thinnest.It is not known with certainty what metals are currently used by Intel or TSMC, though cobalt and ruthenium have been considered as the most promising choices.There has been a lot of speculation about whether the choice of cobalt for the thinnest metal layers has been an important cause of Intel's woes with their "10 nm" CMOS fabrication process.While there were chances for this hypothesis to be true, the actual reasons for Intel's failure to achieve the predicted clock frequencies and fabrication yields with their "10 nm" processes remain unknown, because Intel has never published any information about this.Whichever was the reason, eventually Intel has succeeded to fix this fabrication process, even if only around 5 years later than in their initial plan, after rebranding it in "Intel 7", at least from the point of view of the achievable performances, which have culminated in Raptor Lake Refresh, though perhaps Intel's incapacity of predicting accurately the reliability behavior as a function of the supply voltage, as demonstrated in many failures of Raptor Lake/Alder Lake CPUs, may indicate that they have never succeeded to understand the exact characteristics of this fabrication process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Correct title is "New Films Conduct Better the Thinner They Get"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The research described was done at Stanford by Profs Eric Pop and Krishna Saraswat.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Postel's Law, which expresses the principle that systems should be liberal in what they accept but conservative in what they send. It examines the implications of this law in the context of software development and internet protocols, arguing that while being lenient with inputs from users can foster flexibility and compatibility, it can also lead to complexity and unforeseen vulnerabilities. The author uses the analogy of a "three-ring circus" to illustrate the chaotic nature of managing diverse systems and the importance of balancing acceptance with rigor in programming practices. Overall, the piece offers insights into the intricacies of system design and the challenges posed by the principle's application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43487128"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a counterpoint, Postel's Law as implemented in other domains has been spectacularly successful.One classic example is in transistor networks: each node in a network (think interconnected logic gates, but at the analog level) accepts a wider range of voltages as "high" and "low (i.e., 1- and 0-valued) than they are specified to output. In 5V logic, for example, transistors might output 5V and 0V to within 5%, but accept anything above 1.2V as "high" and below that as "low". (Sometimes called the "static discipline" and used as an example of the "robustness principle"—the other name for Postel's Law.)This is critical in these networks, but not because transistor manufacturers don't read or fully implement the spec: it's because there is invariably unavoidable noise introduced into the system, and one way to handle that is for every node to "clean up" its input to the degree that it can.It's one thing to rely on this type of clean-up to make your systems work in the face of external noise. But when you start rearchitecting your systems to operate close to this boundary—that is, you're no longer trying to meet spec, because you know some other node will clean up your mess for you—you're cooked. Because the invariable noise will now push you outside the range of what your spec's liberal input regime can tolerate, and you'll get errors.The problem isn't Postel's law. It's adverse selection / moral hazard / whatever you want to call the incentive to exploit a system's tolerance for error to improve short-term outcomes for the exploiter but at long-term cost to system stability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's a related phenomenon that we see all the time in automotive circles. A vehicle manufacturer (OEM) needs a new thing, so a supplier develops it in cooperation with them. Great! The requirements were vague and all that, but you arrive at a solution that works. The supplier documents the performance in a product specification stating what it can do and under what conditions. Great! Next the OEM asks for quotes on next gen, and also goes to other suppliers to see if they can provide at lower cost. The OEM uses your product spec as a requirements document and this is where it all goes to shit (a product specification is not a requirements document). They no longer know what they need, but the know what they have and they want "same or better" next time. Over time this can lead to absurd specs and increased complexity to meet them. Sometimes a competitor comes in with a cheaper version and the OEM gets excited based on price and all the actual requirements might get revisited because the cheaper part is out of spec (to save cost).This seems similar to the Postel's Law thing. If you produce to spec but accept things out of spec, the ecosystem will unofficially change the spec to what's actually out there. Then people will re-apply Postel's Law with a wider spec on what you produce and even wider on what you accept. Eventually you end up with a complex mess, but in this case it's a widening spec where in the automotive example it's usually a narrowing spec.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I encourage maintainers to reject user feedback that is much more properly directed to some commercial software vendor who has not implemented the specification correctly.Words to live by.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43487128</guid></item><item><title>40.

Higher quality triple pane windows exist, and they are a luxury for most homeowners. It’s great technology, but relatively few people build or upgrade their house with the long term consequences in mind for these things. There’s a reason you get a positive ROI when you fix up a kitchen or bathroom versus replacing windows which is typically viewed as maintenance. There needs to be incentives for these upgrades to be adopted by home builders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a company called LuxWall that is producing vacuum insulated windows that act basically like a thermos. There is a tiny space between the two panes that is pulled down to a high vacuum that results in a window that only transfers heat via radiation. Conductive and convective heat transfer are essentially eliminated. This results in a window with a R value similar to a fully insulated wall. Because the full unit is so thin, they are able to replace single pane windows in old buildings and drastically cut buildings energy consumption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43456936</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a California bill aimed at phasing out ultra-processed foods in schools as part of an initiative to improve children's health and nutrition. It emphasizes the detrimental effects of these foods on students, including their contributions to obesity and related health issues. The bill seeks to replace unhealthy options with fresher, whole foods in school meals, aligning with broader public health goals. The proposed changes have garnered support from nutrition advocates and aim to foster healthier eating habits among school-aged children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the intent but the devil dwells in the details.  I keep up with the latest nutritional gurus in the US and UK and even staunch advocates of abstaining from Ultra Processed Food (UPF) self-admit to having a very hard time defining exactly what that means.  In addition, there are not a wealth of studies to support the harm of UPF - its mostly, avoid till more is known and educated supposition.  This frustrates attempt to be precise about what's in and what's out.Secondly, why push the deadline out to 2032.  Start banning the clear junk next week.  Ok, maybe it takes a while to hammer out a definition that works but start with simple rules - ratio of dietary fiber to total carbs &lt;= 5; at least one fresh veggie and one fresh fruit per meal (fresh = not the canned in syrup stuff).  CA produces a significant portion of US produce so should be somewhat easy for them.  Not so much for Minnesota but baby steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm grateful that this bill is taking a much more measured approach than the headline suggests. The bill is targeting specific additives, or "excessive" amounts of added sugar, salt, or fat (exact thresholds unnamed)."Ultra-processed" gets thrown about as a big food quality bogeyman, but some definitions of the label are as broad as "contains any amount of added sugar". I'm glad California isn't following a standard that extreme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Vietnam, where freshly cooked meals were a daily staple. Getting them was effortless—just a few steps from home.Coming to the U.S., however, turned this into a major challenge, especially while raising my own kids. Ultra-processed food is everywhere, and preparing fresh meals takes significant time, even though I’ve become quite efficient (a typical meal takes 30–60 minutes).While this doesn’t fully solve our food challenges for kids, it’s a step in the right direction for the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43495997</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issue of unwanted attribute changes in Terraform providers and how to effectively handle them. It highlights the importance of managing and ignoring specific changes to prevent disruptions in infrastructure as code. The author provides practical solutions, including the use of the `ignore_changes` argument in resource definitions, to allow users to maintain stability in their Terraform configurations while still being able to update other attributes without unwanted side effects. Throughout, the post emphasizes best practices for managing Terraform provider behavior to avoid potential conflicts or errors in deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never used this provider, and while I do think you're right that the provider probably shouldn't change the attribute on you, the docs for the `docker_container` resource[1] suggest populating the `image` argument with the `image_id` attribute of a `docker_image` resource[2].This should give you a location to stick in the friendly name of a container that won't get clobbered by the provider.I do like the explanation you provided though, because this is the kind of puzzle you can't really solve with Terraform until you've run into it. I've never used the `replace_triggered_by` feature.[1]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/l...[2]: I was originally expecting `docker_image` to be a data source, but the resource seems to be the recommended method for this, and I didn't wrap my brain around the differences between the data source and the resource before writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As tags aren't necessarily immutable, it's probably advisable to use the full hash in most situations anyway.This is a useful trick in situations where the image changing under your feet isn't very important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;null_resource is being deprecated in favor of terraform_data:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources...~8 years in or so with terraform and I've found null_resource to be a useful crutch in doing things like, "take this source and compile it with this script that'll basically never change, then put it somewhere that's defined in terraform." Overly relying on this mechanism feels like terraform code smell to me, just from my personal experience, if that's even a thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43454642</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see there's a good videophile blog in town -- the world has really need one since audioholics got whiney.I have one of those Shields connected to a trash TV and have a low level of satisfaction with it compared to an XBOX ONE on the other TV now that I'm running Plex. It just has so many little annoyances like the controller seems to discharge itself between uses every time,  an Android interface that almost makes sense, etc.  It sits next to a used Blu-Ray player so I can play discs.I am thinking about replacing it with a used PS4 or maybe a PS5 so I can get a great Plex client that also plays discs,  the used PS4 costs less than a new Shield -- even though I'm disinvesting from Xbox in favor of steam I'm sure there are still some PS4 exclusive games I'd like to play,  though it is late enough in the lifecycle that the PS5 doesn't seem crazy to me and it would be future proof in terms of supporting a future high-end TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So how bright do we want/need our displays to be? How many bits? For me, even a 500 nits TV in a dark room is enough viewing from about 10' away.The advantage of high peak brightness (eg &gt; 1000 nits) is brighter small regions such as specular highlights. 500 nits full field is eye-searing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When is someone going to properly reverse engineer Dolby Vision to make a DV to HDR10+ translator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497398</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; No matter how much time you think young men devote to video games, you’re probably underestimating it. Two decades ago, high-school- and college-age males (ages 15 to 24) spent about a quarter of an hour a day alone playing games. Now, that figure has more than quintupled to 1.4 hours a day.Wat? I'd have expected it to be a lot more.I'm sure there are quite a few who spend over eight hours a day playing games...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing jumped out: many of the states with high rates of "always" lonely, also have high rates of "never" lonely. Many of these states are in the Sun Belt. The article ties those always rates to poverty, these are also states that have had a high in-migration in recent years.Could this contradiction instead be that many of those who report being always lonely are those who have moved recently to the states, and who don't have the connection (often familial) that those who have been around longer, or who have stayed back in the "less lonely" states, have?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I misread some of the article, but seems like younger people just "suck" at being alone?  IE, older people are less likely to feel lonely when they're physically alone?  I wonder if that's because older people are more likely to have a solo hobby - reading a book, knitting, whatever - and younger people are more likely to "doom scroll" online?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470911</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the author's experience driving 300 miles through rural Virginia and requesting public surveillance footage from police to track their vehicle. The author explores the mostly limited availability of such footage, revealing insights into the use of surveillance technology in small communities and the varying degrees of accessibility and transparency from law enforcement agencies. The narrative highlights challenges in obtaining public records, the implications for privacy, and the balance between community safety and individual rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the crazy thing about ANPR/ALPR is just quite how simple it is to create a massive panopticon. The UK has a fairly established national ANPR system, and it generates on the order of 90M records per day [1]. All of this data is available to various law enforcement agencies. If you drive, you're probably being recorded in a way accessible to the PNC every day.Because of how effective this is for catching even fairly minor violations like failure to pay vehicle tax, number plate cloning is becoming pretty common (comparatively) in the UK. This means that you can easily get swept up in a police dragnet because someone has stolen your car's identity.[1] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-anpr-ser...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the genie is out of the bottle, when it comes to ALPRs in the United States, I'd rather just have all the data publicly available. If the cops, data brokers, and insurance companies can see it I should be able to as well.I should be able to see the comings and goings of law enforcement, elected officials, etc, if they can see mine.Alternatively, lock it away behind judicial oversight. Make the cops get a warrant. Criminalize companies collecting the data from offering it in any manner other than by the order of a judge.I feel the same way about tracking cell phones, publicly-owned surveillance cameras, privately-owned surveillance cameras that are "voluntarily" offered to law enforcement, and, in general, any dragnet surveillance available to law enforcement. If it's available to law enforcement and not being conducted on an individual basis under a judicial order (or, heck, even just probable cause) I think it should be available to the public, too."But stalkers!"Tough. That's the price we have to pay for keeping law enforcement in check. Either adapt or take this power away from law enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think there should be an expectation of anonymity for the specific case of operating a car on a public road. It's a lot of responsibility, so you should be scrutinized when you do it.That's part of my grievances against the urbanism of the U.S.A. When the only viable option to get around is cars, there is no privacy.It's important to advocate for public places to be livable for everyone, not just drivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504413</guid></item><item><title>2.

It covers various themes such as personal growth, the importance of resilience, the value of relationships, and the significance of pursuing one’s passions.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm generally in the "never trust the autorouter" camp (and by extension "never trust the bevy of AI tools entering the space"), but it's undeniable there are some big opportunities in the eCAD space to speed up some aspects of layout. I'm probably more likely to use co-creation tools, rather than full auto tools, simply because I rely heavily on iteration. Many times when starting a design my placements aren't set and that has a huge impact on routing. I didn't see on your page whether placement was part of your algorithm. I already rely on tools like push and shove and occasionally auto complete.I'm always curious about people entering the space though. It is a small market, IMO. The tools are fractured, the existing players are lumbering behemoths, and the users are cranky zealots (you will have to pry KiCad out of my cold dead hands). I noted the step about the AR being written in JavaScript, which I have no real opinion on, but I'm curious about plans to plug into ecosystems (CAD vendors, OS tools) or try and draw people into another new ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Point 8, the fast dismissal of Monte-Carlo method is a huge blunder.The point of Monte-Carlo method is that you can tradeoff accuracy for speed. The longer you run your algorithm the more accurate you get.But what's even more interesting is that we can often use the contrapositive : You can get shitty accurate result real fast.Instead of exploring all paths, you explore only one path picked at random.And that's where it shines : when you put it into the most imbricated loop of your algorithm.For example when you want to learn a neural network which autoroute. Typically you would have the outerloop which is updating the neural network parameter, and the inner-loop which is computing a path through the graph.When you use Monte-Carlo this inner-loop which control accuracy can be reduced to 1 iteration if everything is bias-less, you will have a slower outerloop due to higher variance but the machine learning should """theoretically""" learn.This is what allows you to build policies which intuitively always pick the right decision. Like in chess or go, you have some monte-carlo tree search variant like alpha-go-zero or alpha-chess-zero or alpha-router-zero, where even without the search part, the giant cache (encoded by the neural network parameters), once trained, can compute your best guess path in one pass through your neural network aka constant time (with a constant which can easily trade memory for speed by augmenting the number of parameters or training for longer).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a great discussion of autorouting. Then he ends with: "key piece to enable the “vibe-building” of electronics." OuchRouting itself is easy. It's when the router has to tear up stuff it already routed to fit new stuff in that things get complicated and the combinatorics start to get you.I miss the autorouter KiCAD used to have. It was taken out for iffy IP reasons (the author had worked for an autorouting company). Reaction to users who wanted it back were along the lines of "Real Men Don't Use Autorouters".[1][1] https://forum.kicad.info/t/autorouting-and-autoplacement/185...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499992</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get so confused on this. I play around, test, and mess with LLMs all the time and they are miraculous. Just amazing, doing things we dreamed about for decades. I mean, I can ask for obscure things with subtle nuance where I misspell words and mess up my question and it figures it out. It talks to me like a person. It generates really cool images. It helps me write code. And just tons of other stuff that astounds me.And people just sit around, unimpressed, and complain that ... what ... it isn't a perfect superintelligence that understands everything perfectly?  This is the most amazing technology I've experienced as a 50+ year old nerd that has been sitting deep in tech for basically my whole life. This is the stuff of science fiction, and while there totally are limitations, the speed at which it is progressing is insane. And people are like, "Wah, it can't write code like a Senior engineer with 20 years of experience!"Crazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience (almost exclusively Claude), has just been so different that I don't know what to say. Some of the examples are the kinds of things I explicitly wouldn't expect LLMs to be particularly good at so I wouldn't use them for, and others, she says that it just doesn't work for her, and that experience is just so different than mine that I don't know how to respond.I think that there are two kinds of people who use AI: people who are looking for the ways in which AIs fail (of which there are still many) and people who are looking for the ways in which AIs succeed (of which there are also many).A lot of what I do is relatively simple one off scripting. Code that doesn't need to deal with edge cases, won't be widely deployed, and whose outputs are very quickly and easily verifiable.LLMs are almost perfect for this. It's generally faster than me looking up syntax/documentation, when it's wrong it's easy to tell and correct.Look for the ways that AI works, and it can be a powerful tool. Try and figure out where it still fails, and you will see nothing but hype and hot air. 
Not every use case is like this, but there are many.-edit- Also, when she says "none of my students has ever invented references that just don't exist"...all I can say is "press X to doubt"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I become more and more convinced with each of these tweets/blogs/threads that using LLMs well is a skill set akin to using Search well.It’s been a common mantra - at least in my bubble of technologists - that a good majority of the software engineering skill set is knowing how to search well. Knowing when search is the right tool, how to format a query, how to peruse the results and find the useful ones, what results indicate a bad query you should adjust… these all sort of become second nature the longer you’ve been using Search, but I also have noticed them as an obvious difference between people that are tech-adept vs not.LLMs seems to have a very similar usability pattern. They’re not always the right tool, and are crippled by bad prompting. Even with good prompting, you need to know how to notice good results vs bad, how to cherry-pick and refine the useful bits, and have a sense for when to start over with a fresh prompt. And none of this is really _hard_ - just like Search, none of us need to go take a course on prompting - IMO folks jusr need to engage with LLMs as a non-perfect tool they are learning how to wield.The fact that we have to learn a tool doesn’t make it a bad one. The fact that a tool doesn’t always get it 100% on the first try doesn’t make it useless. I strip a lot of screws with my screwdriver, but I don’t blame the screwdriver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498338</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, what a blast from the past. Around the year 2000 or 2001 I got an optical mouse as a present (either birthday or new year, can't remember). I really wanted it for a long time because playing StarCraft with a mechanical one was rather painful.Needless to say it was a USB mouse and I only had ps/2. I purchased an adapter but it never worked despite spending a lot of time trying and testing it with different PCs and mice.Then I took the adapter to an electronics repair shop. They opened it up and explained to me it was fake: it just connected the wires without any circuitry for the real USB support. They had no idea why anyone would manufacturer such a thing.Well, now I know why. I spent quite a long time thinking I was sold a counterfeit adapter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once had a very awkward conversation with a sales person in PC World.I had been given a old retired server from work to take home and learn with... only problem was it had no USB.I was asking for a PS2 keyboard, he said they don't sell them but I could use any USB keyboard, I told him I don't have any USB ports and I needed a PS2 keyboard.After awhile of him going back and forth with his manager, only to return to tell me i can use USB, It turned out he thought I was trying to buy a Play Station 2 keyboard and he'd never heard of PS/2!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some more details (and interesting historical perspective) can be found here: https://superuser.com/questions/704920/how-to-determine-if-u...Apparently around 2014 the vast majority of mouses and keyboards were dual-protocol, but in 2019 the first reports of them being USB-only started appearing. I suspect a lot of the cheapest mouse SoCs are still dual-protocol as they worked when first designed, and they just kept producing them without any changes.Pinout and explanation of how they detect protocol here: https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/28288/how...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499823</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on strategies for developers to write effective blog posts that engage readers. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the audience, using clear language, and structuring content well. Key tips include writing with a conversational tone, incorporating personal experiences, and being concise while providing value. The author also highlights the benefits of sharing knowledge through blogging, such as building a professional reputation and contributing to the community. Overall, the piece serves as a guide to help developers create impactful written content that resonates with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My general takes (as someone who also has a somewhat popular blog) is thatThe inverted pyramid is almost always the correct format for your text.  I often put the tweet-length version of the post in the title or first paragraph.  Get to the point quickly, then elaborate.  Means you can bail out at any point of the text and still take home most of what mattered, while the meticulous crowd can have their nitpicks addressed toward the end.The problem of finding an audience is best solved by being really transparent about what you're about.  Inverted pyramid solves that.  There's no point to drawing in people who aren't going to be interested.  Retaining existing readers beats capturing new readers.I'm less bullish on images, unless they are profoundly relevant to the text.  Illustrations for the sake of having illustrations are no bueno in my opinion.  You want to reduce distractions and visual noise.  Images should above all never be funny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counterpoint: writing blog posts so that they are read by someone else completely defeats the point of writing for 99% of people. I do not mean to say that this the advice in the post is bad advice, just that if you focus on being read (i.e., checking rankings on HN, only writing articles that don't exist yet) you probably just will just stop writing at one point, because most of the stuff on the web just isn't read, and writing just to be read is probably not very motivating.Writing, even if no one reads what you write, is super valuable, and fun! Writing something down is to structure your own thoughts so that you learn more about the topic and about yourself. In my experience, publishing a piece of your writing just ensures that you double check your thinking, but most of the benefit is learning more about what you intend to write about.So here's my advice: just write posts on what you think is interesting on your personal blog. Don't install analytics, just write it down, publish it, and put it on your LinkedIn. Someone will see it someday and will like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reckon if you wanted to choose just a single rule it should be, "Write something that you yourself would actually read." The problem is that our brains are designed to sort of lie to us and tell us that what we've created is amazing when in fact we'd never actually read it if someone else had written it. If you can find a way to be objective and see your own writing as the far-from-perfect mess it actually is.(In principle, you could use "write something that someone else would actually read", but I think this is much harder, because it's much harder to know how other people would react! If you yourself would read it, well, we aren't that unique, lots of other people would read it too.)Also, props for this stark picture of reality: https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/write-blog-posts-dev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503872</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A recently discovered giant fungus-like organism, found in a forest in Oregon, may represent an entirely new branch of life, distinct from known fungi, plants, or animals. Researchers are studying its unique characteristics and genetic makeup, revealing its potential evolutionary significance. This organism could challenge existing classifications in biology and enhance our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Its fossils contained plantlike lignin instead of funguslike chitin or chitosan.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.14.643340v1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototaxites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Upon examining the internal structure of the fossilized Prototaxites, the researchers found that its interior was made up of a series of tubesWho knew the internet evolved millions of years ago?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with eukarya containing all multicellular organisms within the four kingdoms of fungi, animals, plants and protists.This bugs me so much. The four-kingdom system should have died out decades ago, it's absurdly wrong. For one thing, fungi and animals should be together (opisthokonts) if you're dividing eukaryotes into the major groups. If you consider genetics, there's no such thing as "protists", they're just a whole bunch of small things that were grouped together because we didn't know otherwise.It's more like, Archaeplastida, Excavata, SAR supergroup, Amoebozoa, and Opisthokonta at the moment. The exact list is up for debate, and currently undergoing change. There's plenty of weird things like Hemimastigophora and we're not really sure where they fit yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499342</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great to see that somebody else creates a true open source XSLT 3 and XPATH 3 implementation!I worked on projects which refused to use anything more modern than XSLT &amp; XPATH 1.0 because of lack of support in the non Java/Net World (1.0 = tech from 1999). Kudos to Saxon though, it was and is great but I wished there were more implementations of XSLT 2.0 &amp; XPATH 2.0 and beyond in the open source World... both are so much more fun and easier to use in 2.0+ versions.
For that reason I've never touched XSLT 3.0 (because I stuck to Saxon B 9.1 from 2009). I have no doubt it's a great spec  but there should be other ways than only Saxon HE to run it in an open source way.It's like we have an amazing modern spec but only one browser engine to run it ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many humongous XML sources. E.g. the Wikipedia archive is 42GB of uncompressed text. Holding a fully parsed representation of it in memory would take even more, perhaps even &gt;100GB which immediately puts this size of document out of reach.The obvious solution is streaming, but streaming appears to not be supported, though is listed under Challenging Future Ideas: https://github.com/Paligo/xee/blob/main/ideas.mdHow hard is it to implement XML/XSLT/XPATH streaming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This, thirty years later, is the best pitch for XML I’ve read. Essentially, it’s a slow moving, standards-based approach to data interoperability.I hated it the minute I learned about it, because it missed something I knew I cared about, but didn’t have a word for in the 90s - developer ergonomics. XML sucks shit for someone who wants to think tersely and code by hand. Seriously, I hate it with a fiery passion.Happily to my mind the economics of easier-for-creators -&gt; make web browsers and rendering engines either just DEAL with weird HTML, or else force people to use terse data specs like JSON won out. And we have a better and more interesting internet because of it.However, I’m old enough now to appreciate there is a place for very long-standing standards in the data and data transformation space, and if the XML folks want to pick up that banner, I’m for it. I guess another way to say it is that XML has always seemed to be a data standard which is intended to be what computers prefer, not people. I’m old enough to welcome both, finally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43502291</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The preface of "Cosmic Python" sets the stage for a practical exploration of Python programming through the lens of functional and object-oriented design. It emphasizes the importance of building maintainable and scalable applications, and introduces core concepts that will be covered in the book, such as the evolution of Python and its various paradigms. The authors aim to guide readers in understanding and applying these principles to develop robust software solutions. The preface serves as an invitation for both novice and experienced developers to enhance their skills in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow this book is a goldmine for architecture patterns. I love how easy it is to get into a topic and quickly grasp it.Having said that, from a practical and experience standpoint, using some of these patterns can really spiral out into an increased complexity and performance issues in Python, specially when you use already opinionated frameworks like Django which already uses the ActiveRecord pattern.I’ve been in companies big and small using Python, both using and ignoring architectural patterns. Turns out all the big ones with strict architectural (n=3) pattern usage, although “clean”, the code is waaaay to complex and unnecessarily slow in tasks that at first glance should had been simple.Whereas the big companies that didn’t care for these although the code was REALLY ugly in some places (huge if-else files/functions, huge Django models with all business logic implemented in them), I was most productive because although the code was ugly I could read it, understand it, and modify the 1000 lines of if-else statements.Maybe this says something about me more than the code but I hate to admit I was more productive in the non clean code companies. And don’t get me started on the huge amount of discussions they avoided on what’s clean or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some parts of this book are extremely useful, especially when it's talking about concepts that are more general than Python or any other specific language -- such as event-driven architecture, commands, CQRS etc.That being said, I have a number issues with other parts of it, and I have seen how dangerous it can be when inexperienced developers take it as a gospel and try to implement everything at once (which is a common problem with any collection of design patterns like this.For example, repository is a helpful pattern in general; but in many cases, including the examples in the book itself, it is a huge overkill that adds complexity with very little benefit. Even more so as they're using SQLAlchemy, which is a "repository" in its own right (or, more precisely, a relational database abstraction layer with an ORM added on top).Similarly, service layers and unit of work are useful when you have complex applications that cover multiple complex use cases; but in a system consisting of small services with narrow responsibilities they quickly become overly bloated using this pattern. And don't even get me started with dependency injection in Python.The essential thing about design patterns is that they're tools like any other, and the developers should understand when to use them, and even more importantly when not to use them. This book has some advice in that direction, but in my opinion it should be more prominent and placed upfront rather at the end of each chapter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a Typescript dev but this book is one of my favorite architecture books, I reference it all the time. My favorite pattern is the fake unit of work/service patterns for testing, I use this religiously in all my projects for faking (not mocking!!) third party services. It also helped me with dilemmas around naming, eg it recommends naming events in a very domain specific way rather than infrastructure or pattern specific way (eg CART_ITEM_BECAME_UNAVAILABLE is better than USER_NOTIFICATION). Some of these things are obvious but tedious to explain to teammates, so the fact that cosmic python is fully online makes it really easy to link to. Overall, a fantastic and formative resource for me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43501989</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the transformation of Kerala, a state in India, from poverty to prosperity, highlighting several key factors that contributed to this change. It discusses the role of strong governmental policies, effective land reform, investments in education and healthcare, and the promotion of social welfare, which have collectively enhanced the quality of life for its residents. Additionally, it examines how Kerala's unique political landscape and emphasis on social equity have fostered economic stability and growth, making it a noteworthy example among India's states. The analysis emphasizes the importance of these strategies in achieving sustainable development and improving the overall well-being of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in the US but my parents are from Kerala and I still have family there that I visit.One thing I found interesting was the pride in literacy and education. Kerala has a 96% literacy rate which is the highest in India [1].It's one of my favorite places to visit. Unlike other parts of India such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Hyderbad -- it's tropical and lush with much less pollution than what you might see in those other parts of India.My parents have a home in a rural community which hasn't changed much in the past few decades compared to somewhere like Bengaluru. It's quiet and slow with a high important on family relationships. No doubt it's westernizing, albeit slower than other parts of India - but for now it still holds much of the charm I've known since I was a kid.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_India&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in the second southernmost district of Kerala, Quilon (now Kollam). I am now a U.S. citizen in the Bay Area. Growing up in Quilon, I attended an Anglo-Indian boy's school called Infant Jesus - in a small strip of land called Thangassery, people predominantly spoke English. I was taught British dialects emphasizing pronunciations that mimicked the world stage. I didn't really understand it until much later in life.In my 20s, the contrast hit when I traveled across other parts of India.Kerala has a mix of Western population that decided to stay back after the Indian Independence that brought with them Christianity, education, hospitals, and the Catholic culture. Kerala is also one of the few places in India where you can eat beef without inhibitions.The writer hasn't emphasized this enough, but when oil struck the Middle East in the 1960s, the massive influx of blue and white-collar labor (who had the English language and engineering skills) that helped set up what's now Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Oman, and many other countries was built by Malayalees. My father-in-law was one of the earlier engineers at Aramco in Saudi. The Middle Eastern money has flown back to Kerala thanks to high bank interest rates (nearly 10%) and landlocked real estate that helped raise the state's GDP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kerala has extremely aggressive out-migration (including my entire family): it is a bad place to be ambitious, particularly with the France-like union culture. If India is to become China-rich or Mexico-rich, my prediction is Kerala will regress to the mean of India states. Its model seems geared towards being an extremely good place to be poor (which is a huge achievement to be clear: they dealt with COVID better than the US, universal literacy is amazing etc) but not towards getting richer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43507286</guid></item><item><title>11.

Now imagine yourself in that condition: you're under the swimming pool in molasses, and now you can only move like the hands of a clock.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always get the impression that people spend more time writing Forth interpreters, rather than writing Forth programs to solve actual problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what I miss about the Red Power mod for Minecraft.  I wonder if GregTech would see the fun in adding some sort of CPU that wouldn't be the worst emulation stacked inside of hand written 'machine' op functions...Offhand, anyone know of any good (either long stable, or better, well maintained and likely to persist) CPU emulators for Java?  Something that does 'web assembly' might fit the task if it's reasonable to transpile a fake binary format into real WASM.The first good search result I got was : https://github.com/dylibso/chicory : better than wasmer-java for this use case since it doesn't depend on native binaries.Relating this back to the topic.  It would be interesting to have to, at least copy in someone else's if not, write your own Forth interpreter to help bootstrap computers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heh - I was looking for examples of 6502 Forth. I did fine fig-forth, but this looks interesting too now. This always happens on hacker news - I have some interest, and I see it on the front page of Hacker News soon after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503897</guid></item><item><title>13. xAI has acquired X, xAI now valued at $80B</title><link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1905731750275510312</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an innovative approach to decomposing the factorial of a number into larger factors, specifically focusing on the formula \( n! \) represented as a product of integers that are significantly larger than one. It explores methods to identify such decompositions, the implications for number theory, and provides examples illustrating the process. The author emphasizes the mathematical significance and potential applications of this technique in various areas, including combinatorics and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edit: as pointed out, you can't simply divide by each number, because then its not equal to original number factorial.  However, I've fixed the algorithm somewhat maintaining the basic ideaThe "naive" way  100!= 2*3*4*...*99*100

Obviously t(100) &gt; 1. If we can get rid of the single 2, we know that t(100) &gt; 2.  If you multiply the whole thing by 2/2 (=1),  100! = (2/2)*2*3*4*...*50*...99*100
       = (2*2/2)*3*4*...*50*...99*100
       = (4/2)*3*4*...*50*...99*100
       = 4*3*4*...*50*...99*(100/2)
       = 3*4*4*...*50*50*...99

We can continue with t(100) &gt; 3 by multiplying by 3/3 and pairing it with 99, i.e. 99*3*(3/3) = (99/3)*3*3 = 33*9  yielding  100! = 4*4*5*...*9*9*10*..*33*33*...*50*50...*97*98

However, once we get to t(100) &gt; 4, trying to get rid of 4, we have to skip 98 since its not divisible by 4.  The other problem is we have two 4s...  If we had instead using 98 for getting rid of 2, we can then use 100, and 96 for the other 4.  This is our first "gotcha" for the naive algorithm of always picking the largest number, which seems intuitive at first glance.Now if we test all possibilities starting with 2, we get 48 choices for the dividing 2 (even numbers &gt; 2, not including 2 which will not increase t(100) beyond 2.  Then ~33 choices for dividing 3 (depending if our div of 2 resulted in a factor of 3), ~25 for 4, But notice since we now have two 4s, we have to do it twice, so its 25*24 choices for getting rid of 4.*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Out of curiosity, I wondered how tight these bounds are. Consider the case of 300,000 which Terry has put a lower bound of 90,000 on, and would like a bound of 100,000 on. If a perfect division of factors into equal buckets could be achieved, the answer would be 110366.49020484093 per bucket. That's e^(log(n!)/n), to within the precision that Python calculates it. (My first try was to use Stirling's formula. That estimated it at 110366.49020476094, which is pretty darned close!)A straightforward greedy approach will see those final buckets differing by factors of around 2. Which is a lot worse than Terry's current approach.This really is a knapsack problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a kid I was bugged by the fact that Stirling formula doesn't give exact integer result, so I set to find my own formula. I failed, but discovered that sum from 1 to N is (n*n+n)/2. Surely if perfect formula for sum exists, for multiplication should exist too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43506238</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice overview on the whole process, congrats on what was achieved and next steps.We need more this kind of projects.Also an heads up that besides TinyGo, there is indeed another baremetal Go version available being used in commercial products, TamaGo.Although probably it would have been more challenging as TinyGo allowed for on this project.https://www.osfc.io/2024/talks/tamago-bare-metal-go-for-arm-...https://www.withsecure.com/en/solutions/innovative-security-...https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been decompiling a PS1 era game for the past year or so, and it was so nice to find Sony used GCC as their compiler. There’s a significant number of MIPS tools in GCC that still work, the source and patches from that version still exist, and are open source. PS2 seems similar, but for the PSP they chose MetroWorks instead, which introduces some challenges, primarily just knowing quirks about the compiler.I wouldn’t be surprised if most languages supported by GCC (and possibly clang as a front end) could target many older systems as long as the runtime can be statically  compiled into the final binary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it still doesn't count until you burn a DVD that works on real hardware each time after an attempted compilation :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498481</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The episode "The Real Book" from 99% Invisible explores the intriguing history and significance of "The Real Book," a collection of jazz standards that has become a staple among musicians. Originally self-published in the 1970s, it was created by Berklee College of Music students as a way to share and access essential jazz tunes. The episode delves into the book's impact on jazz culture, the legal and ethical challenges of its distribution, and how it reflects the broader themes of musical tradition, accessibility, and innovation within the jazz community.&lt;/p&gt;

I think a lot of jazz people look down on it (or those who need it), but I didn't really get deep enough to see that.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of EU regulations on Apple's proprietary AWDL technology, which facilitates peer-to-peer communication over Wi-Fi. The EU’s push for interoperability and open standards has led to a shift towards cross-platform solutions, challenging the dominance of Apple’s system. It emphasizes the implications for developers and users, suggesting that while enhanced interoperability may benefit consumers, it could complicate the integration of existing technologies and reduce the seamless experience that AWDL provided. The piece ultimately highlights the tension between regulatory demands and technological innovation in the wireless communication space.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish there were some write-ups for doing wifi-p2p aka wifi-aware (the wifi alliance's proprietary branding for it) on Linux! Incredibly sad that it's just so so so undocumented; such a neat sounding suite of capabilities.Haven't looked in 2-3 years, but found so little ehm last I looked. Very dismaying. So many folks doing "p2p" file sharing apps, but generally they assume you have setup networking already. We really need to own the means of connectivity. Especially now!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently wanted to do point-to-point Wi-Fi for transferring some data but apparently support for the ad-hoc IBSS mode wasn't available on my MT7925. Wi-Fi Aware is completely new to me and didn't come up while searching on the topic at all. I can't find anything about using it on Linux now either. Anybody have any references on its support?There's a single kernel commit referencing Wi-Fi Aware from 2023 [0].
iw supposedly supports a few commands pertaining to it [1].  [0] https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=v6.14&amp;id=9b89495e479c5fedbf3f2eca4f1c4e9dd481265e
  [1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53594406/implementing-a-wifi-aware-application-outside-android&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WiFi Aware looks interesting but there seems to be very little information out there beyond Android related docs and associated links. It seems to be hidden away behind the doors of WiFi alliance.Can anyone familiar with the topic chime in what it would take to utilize WiFi Aware in let's say a Raspberry Pi (maybe using a different wireless chip connected via usb)? Maybe even to connect to Android smartphones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505022</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off-topic, but the fact that this script even needs a package manager in a language with a standard library as large as Python is pretty shocking. Making an HTTP request js pretty basic stuff for a scripting language, you shouldn’t need or want a library for it.And I’m not blaming the author, the standard library docs even recommend using a third party library (albeit not the one the author is using) on the closest equivalent (urllib.request)!&gt; The Requests package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.Especially for a language that has not cared too much about backwards compatibility historically, having an ergonomic HTTP client seems like table stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone use PEP 723 + uv with an LSP based editor? What's your workflow? I looked into it briefly, the only thing I saw after a lot of digging around was to use `uv sync --script &lt;script file&gt;` and get the venv from the output of this command, activate that venv or specify it in your editor. Is there any other way, what I describe above seems a bit hacky since `sync` isn't meant to provide the venv path specifically, it just happens to display it.Edit: I posted this comment before reading the article. Just read it now and I see that the author also kinda had a similar question. But I guess the author didn't happen to find the same workaround as I mention using the `sync` output. If the author sees this, maybe they can update the article if it's helpful to mention what I wrote above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm generally not a fan of the incremental rustification of the Python ecosystem, but I started using uv a few weeks ago just for this particular case and have been liking it. And to the point where I'm considering to migrate my full projects as well from their current conda+poetry flow. Just a couple days ago I also modified a script I've been using for a few years to patch pylsp so it can now see uv script envs using the "uv sync --dry-run --script &lt;path&gt;" hack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43500124</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The page on Calabro.io introduces Zig, a programming language designed for optimal performance, safety, and simplicity. It highlights the language's ability to interoperate with C and its focus on ease of use for developers, making it suitable for both systems programming and high-level applications. The article also outlines the benefits of using Zig, including its compile-time code execution, safety features, and the elimination of hidden control flow, ultimately promoting productivity and reliability in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post seems to be missing an additional opportunity: Zig's build can involve go build!  Use Build.addSystemCommand, have it depend on library step, and have the install step depend on that step.  This reduces the steps to build to just 'zig build'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We tried this a few years back with a very loaded Go server using SQLite (actual C SQLite, not modernc.org/sqlite) and something made performance tank... likely some difference between glibc and musl. We never had time to hunt it down. We talked to Zig folk about sponsoring them to work on it, making performance comparable to glibc-built-SQLite, but they were busy at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the magic seems to happen in    const lib = b.addLibrary(.{
        .linkage = .static,
        .name = "cgo_static_linking",
        .root_module = lib_mod,
    });

and/*
#cgo LDFLAGS: -L./zig-out/lib -lcgo_static_linking -static
#include "zig_lib.h"

If we compare similar models:- Llama 3.1 with 405B parameters: 2 TB of memory (FP32), 500 GB (FP8)- DeepSeek R1 with 671B parameters: 1.3 TB (scaling linearly, around 600 GB for 300B parameters)Ling claims no more than 96 GB of memory, most likely for inference.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man, I'm really keen for this. The GBA Sonic games are often slept on but I think they were amazing at recreating the feel of the original Mega Drive games, with great music and sprite work too. I've long thought they deserved a modern PC port in the style of Sonic 1 Forever or Sonic Origins, to free them from the cramped GBA screen.Sonic fans have been making a lot of these unofficial, enhanced, moddable PC ports using decompilation, recompilation and emulation techniques, including Sonic 1 Forever, Sonic 3 A.I.R. and recently, the Sonic Unleashed PC port. PC (including Linux) is getting to be the definitive platform for playing a lot of these older Sonic games, which is great to see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love projects like these. Between decomps and static analyzers, we've seen so many fantastic games modernized and ported.Ocarina of Time is able to play natively on just about every system system imagineable (pretty sure native PS1 builds exist)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of asking thoughtful questions in various contexts, emphasizing that formulating good questions is often more challenging than providing answers. It explores how asking the right questions can lead to deeper understanding, foster creativity, and drive meaningful conversations. The piece also highlights practical strategies for developing questioning skills, advocating for curiosity and open-mindedness as key components in the quest for knowledge and effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That question regarding why orchestra performances  are subdue affairs came up recently when I attended a Lord of the rings concert in NYC. It wasn’t particularly rowdy, but people were certainly enjoying themselves. When I had posted about this on Reddit, there was a lot of attitudes about how it’s a uniquely American thing and at the European concerts people didn’t clap or laugh or audibly enjoy themselves as much as the NYC concert goers did. I’ll have to bookmark that link for later.Unrelated to the article, but related to the topic, the compliment that gives me the most dopamine is when somebody I respect and is above my level of knowledge tells me “that’s a great question”. It just makes me realize that I’m closer to their level if I’m asking questions that stumped them or that they are already thinking of but surprised I asked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comic on questions vs answers, "A Day At The Park", https://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Good questions" require understanding, a uniquely human concept as it exists strictly within the mind of a person."Great answers" can be identified as such by entities possessing understanding of the question posed.  As defined above, this is a uniquely human concept.Central to the above assertions are two words within the article's title; "good" and "great."  These are valuations ascribed by a person, not an algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498570</guid></item><item><title>25. 7.7 magnitude earthquake hits Southeast Asia, affecting Myanmar and Thailand</title><link>https://twitter.com/TaraBull808/status/1905534938558157139</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To my surprise, what used to be called iWork has been my main "Office" replacement for years now. It's good enough, and it's free. I have switched over most of the non-technical people in my life to it, and they have no issues using it (except if they email a .pages document to a Windows user).I especially enjoy Numbers and the way you can arrange multiple tables on a page. It's a different paradigm coming from Google Sheets or Excel and takes some getting used to, but to me it now makes more sense.Of course, if I need something "done right", I'll drop down to Affinity, LaTeX, or InDesign. But I rarely have these needs nowadays.A similar argument could be made for going all in on Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, but I feel queasy knowing that all of my data is in a free Google account, after reading some of the stories here about reaching Google support if something goes sideways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I'm evaluating a potential application whose core functionality does not require external resources/servers (Dropbox for example) and they don't at a minimum offer some kind of perpetual fallback license (aka the Jetbrains annual subscription model), then I straight up bounce.Examples of good alternatives- Pixelmator &gt; Photoshop- Davinci Resolve &gt; Premiere- Reaper &gt; AuditionI have no interest in renting my tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish everyone would switch to LibreOffice so I can stop having to explain why their documents are formatted weirdly after I edit them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499860</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Byung-Chul Han in burnout society introduces the concept of hyperattention, which is the kind of attention that seems efficient at first, because it gives the impression of enabling you to multitask, but in reality it robs you from any deep and meaningful connection to anything around you.That's is pretty much what happens with anything tech nowadays. Because we see technology as a pure feat of rationality where in fact what we consume are nothing more than cultural artifacts, which will invariably reflect the fundamental problems of the society in which these artifacts are forged. In our case, in the Burnout Society, it's potentializing hyperattention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is largely correct, and I've personally been doing something similar to him for the last few year: purchasing physical media, shunning unnecessary smart gizmos that I don't directly control, and otherwise trying to just be disconnected for a period of time each day.Each time I find some small anachronistic way to be offline a little more I can feel myself relax just a bit.A well lived life is not an exercise in optimization, but our phones lead us to live that way. So, I think I'm done looking for the best way to do things for awhile, and I'm going to focus on finding the most enjoyable way to do them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree to a lot of this. But there is something even more disturbing than the constant surveillance. With the rise of AI we can no longer be sure if what we devote our attention to is an artefact of culture or just some derivative that has been automatically created to keep our attention up. And we ultimately have to ask ourselfs what the hell are we doing here? If history is removed from the artefact it becomes meaningless but how do we evaluate that and what is the consequence? Live music and theatre plays instead of movies and video games?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43509548</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research highlighting how certain tropical trees are negatively impacted by lightning strikes. Conducted by scientists at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the study reveals that while these trees have adapted to their environment, the increasing frequency of lightning due to climate change poses a significant risk to their health and survival. The findings underscore the need for further understanding of the ecological effects of changing weather patterns on tropical forests and the species that inhabit them.&lt;/p&gt;

This adaptation ensures that the tree times the release of most of its seeds to coincide with fire, which creates ideal conditions for regeneration success. Fire burns off woody debris and exposes the soil, it creates an ash layer that returns nutrients to the soil and increases sunlight by killing some of the competing pines and firs.https://www.savetheredwoods.org/interactive/giant-sequoia-an...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“If you explained trees to someone who’d never heard of them—towers that drink through their feet, turn light into food, and whisper through fungal cables—they’d think it’s the craziest tech ever invented.” Add this to the list&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really cool, feels like the v1 of the lightning trees from Hyperion.

First of all, the superellipse had an advocate, Piet Hein. If the superhyperbola has an advocate, he’s not a very effective advocate.Piet Hein was a designer. The superellipse, being closed, is a much more useful shape for designing physical objects, and fitting a roundish shape into a rectangular space is a useful property in our world of architectural square corners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s not clear why the superellipse would be common and the superhyperbola obscureI think the explanation is pretty obvious: The hyperbola itself is way more obscure than the ellipse to begin with, so it’s not surprising that hyperbola variations are also obscure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super-hyper-bola: the unstoppable bola.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The supercavitating supersonic submarine is a nice endpoint for the evasion discussion but I can't help thinking about the wake that would leave.Yes it can depart the firing area quickly but if one wanted to find it again for counterfire, surely the point where the absurd wake turbulence ends is a suitable search datum.Presumably an opponent with capable spaceships can spare the power required for scans along these principles: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S09242...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool idea. Atmospheric attenuation (regardless even if you lase at "transmissible" freqs), would be a major issue. Additionally, beam steering and focusing from 1000km+, and accounting (essentially a variable continuously changing integration) for a high variability in index of refraction would make it possible without a closed-loop feedback of on target strike.
Rough ballparks, I mean, the beam power density required would likely far exceed the thermal dissipation rate of any heat pipe, etc, tech I am officially aware of.
Space warfare is super fun tho. However, this is a very outdated idea. If anyone like noodling on this stuff, they should DM me. There are far better ideas... unofficially.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN, where one story is about hypothetical submarine spaceship laser battles, and the next is about usb-ps2 mouse port adapters, and you want to read them both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499755</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed a new method for dissolving plastic waste in the ocean quickly, potentially within just a few hours, without creating harmful microplastics. This innovative solution utilizes a specially designed chemical reaction that breaks down plastics into benign substances. The breakthrough could significantly address the growing problem of plastic pollution in marine environments, offering a promising approach to clean up oceans and improve ecological health.&lt;/p&gt;

Which is not itself a problem, but it's also useless garbage because neither the AI, nor the person generating it, appear to understand what is actually happening, and consequently the image is literally worse than useless. Image has what appear to be benzene rings, although the AI is clearly crossing that concept with neurons, but sodium hexametaphosphate has a fairly different shape: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hexametaphosphate that I would expect an artist to pick up on... and of course the cross-contamination of the neuron concept is just wrong.And even by strictly non-scientific standards, the ocean having two distinct surfaces, one below another, is just unsightly and obviously wrong. Alternatively, this plastic really does rip holes in the ocean's surface and directly expose The Murky Depths to the surface world in a geometrically anomalous manner, in which case for C'thulu's sake we should probably never manufacture this stuff in any quantity.I won't go so far as to say AI image generation shouldn't be used here, but this is a nominally educational context. It needs to be screened by someone who can make sure it actually means something other than "you are a dummy who can't handle too much text in a single block so here's some bling to stab your dopamine receptors so you can bear the terrible drudgery of continuing to read".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actual source (source of source of source):https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado1782More research from Takuzo Aida, which is quite impressive to read how they got there:https://www.science.org/authored-by/Aida/Takuzo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if that thing could be used as food packaging, since food has salt and water.Also that means this plastic probably has a very short lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505626</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of focusing on personal projects and passions to achieve fulfillment and success in life. It emphasizes that pursuing what genuinely interests you can lead to unique opportunities and a more satisfying life. The author encourages readers to prioritize their own work and goals instead of conforming to societal expectations or conventional paths, advocating for the development of skills and experiences that align with one's true interests. Ultimately, the piece serves as a motivational guide to embracing personal initiative and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that there is a difference between wanting to have more money and wanting to make more money.The author seems to be lucky in being born with the latter trait, but most humans luckily don't.If you're in the other group, feel free to simply ignore this advice.  Make money to support yourself and your surroundings, but don't feel sad that you can't constantly do the things you love.  It is just not how reality works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I would rather be poor than make a lot of money doing something I hate.I too would love to have that choice. But my wife and kids might disagree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"If you do something you love, you will become good at it much faster than something you don’t love, and when you are good at something you will have some opportunity to commercialize it."This sums up my life philosophy very well at this point. It also applies to kids and education, as I encourage my boy to do the things he loves (happens to be Minecraft and its thousands of mods, commands and other things to learn), and gently guide him over time to a place where he might be able to commercialize his skills in the future. It's amazing to see what a child is able to learn when they are obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470146</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few months on Hacker News there was a post about Mixxx[1], an open-source DJ software.  It prompted me to download it and play around.  It's very cool.  Despite being a complete novice, I learned a few things after a dozen hours of playing around:* I don't have a physical controller, but I can understand why people always use them.  Keyboard and mouse are not fully sufficient.* The built-in key and beat detection is really quite good for house music, and it gets you most of the way there in terms of managing song transitions (but not all the way there)* A side effect of consuming 99% of all of my music from youtube and spotify means I have no local library to feed into Mixxx (I ended up yt-dlp'ing a bunch of stuff)* There is a true art in song selection, and I don't possess this skill.[1] https://mixxx.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well written, tech heavy, and one of the best writeups I've seen on ripping vinyl to USB high speed SD cards.* And those were mentioned almost in passing, entirely not the point of the article, but so great to see!I want to also tell the world about Techno-club.net. There's a ton of UR-related artists still making true-spirit techno. Fantastic selektors!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avalon Emerson is such a great dj and producer. I’d love to see them live sometime - I’ve a great set from 2017 of theirs on SoundCloud that’s really eclectic. Love the style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43509061</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of entropy in the context of information theory and cryptography. It explains how entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness of a system and highlights its significance in secure communication. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding entropy when designing cryptographic systems, as higher entropy translates to stronger security. The post also critiques common misconceptions about entropy, providing insights into its mathematical foundations and practical applications in maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, there's no actual need for this huge pile of random numbers. If you've somehow managed to generate one secure 256-bit key then from that key you can derive all the "random" numbers you'll ever need for every cryptographic protocol—and you can do this derivation in a completely deterministic, auditable, testable way, as illustrated by EdDSA. (If you haven't managed to generate one secure 256-bit key then you have much bigger problems.)This excerpt was the impetus to leave my job working for a company that makes a stupidly expensive high throughput hardware Quantum TRNG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There are also people asserting that it's important for RNGs to provide "prediction resistance" against attackers who, once upon a time, saw the entire RNG state.At this point we regularly have microarchitectural side-channels that can (with varying speed and reliability) leak kernel memory. It's easy to say "if someone can read kernel memory it's game over", but imho it's better to harden against state compromise than to not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this attack is less interesting than it sounds, given the specificity of the situation. IF you have a device which can read all the state/secrets on your machine AND the only write access it has to your machine is providing bits to use as an RNG seed, THEN (using this article) you can manipulate the output of the RNG, and exfil some data if you want.I'm struggling to come up with a situation where this would happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470339</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to identify and resolve disk I/O bottlenecks encountered during Continuous Integration (CI) processes in GitHub Actions. It outlines the causes of disk I/O issues, such as excessive read and write operations, and offers practical strategies to diagnose these problems. Techniques include using profiling tools and analyzing logs to pinpoint slow steps in CI workflows. The piece also emphasizes optimizing configuration and resource allocation to improve overall performance, helping developers streamline their CI processes and enhance efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of fun things we've done for CI runners to improve CI:- Configured a block-level in-memory disk accelerator / cache (fs operations at the speed of RAM!)- Benchmarked EC2 instance types (m7a is the best x86 today, m8g is the best arm64)- "Warming" the root EBS volume by accessing a set of priority blocks before the job starts to give the job full disk performance [0]- Launching each runner instance in a public subnet with a public IP - the runner gets full throughput from AWS to the public internet, and IP-based rate limits rarely apply (Docker Hub)- Configuring Docker with containerd/estargz support- Just generally turning kernel options and unit files off that aren't needed[0] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-initial...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`apt` installation could be easily sped-up with `eatmydata`: `dpkg` calls `fsync()` on all the unpacked files, which is very slow on HDDs, and `eatmydata` hacks it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly the kind of content marketing I want to see. The IO bottleneck data and the fio scripts are useful to all. Then at the end a link to their product which I’d never heard of, in case you’re dealing with the issue at hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43506574</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children are most hurt by low expectations.   Especially young children.There's subtlety to this, high demands are not high expectations.  If there's consequences for not meeting some high standard you set for children, you're going to create a very life-destroying kind of learned helplessness.  Kids shouldn't be punished for failure.And if it's something dangerous to try, then of course it's gotta be something you limit.But beyond that, just don't assume kids aren't ready for something without evidence.  Let them try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This should not be surprising to anyone who has a preschooler.  They're also way better at problem-solving than most people expect, it's just that you often don't want them solving their "problems".When my kid was 18 months old, we had gated him off from a playroom with a bunch of toys used by his older brother that were not baby-safe.  We had a DoorMonkey [1] placed up high, about 5 feet tall, so that only adults could reach.  My kid gets a chair from across the room, pushes it next to the door, climbs up on top of it, unlatches the DoorMonkey, pushes open the door, climbs down from the chair, enters the playroom, looks at me, and says "Bye!"  At that moment my wife gets out of the bathroom, sees the tableau, says "____?  What are you doing?" and my toddler says "Uh oh."[1] https://doormonkey.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was somewhat obvious. Kids are really smart in their limited context. It’s communication they need to learn.This is similar with people. Many people are quite intelligent, just not in a way we value or understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470138</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the record low maximum extent of Arctic sea ice observed in 2025, highlighting significant factors contributing to this decline such as climate change and rising temperatures. It details the implications of reduced sea ice for the Arctic ecosystem, global weather patterns, and climate feedback mechanisms. The analysis includes statistical data and visualizations of sea ice trends, emphasizing the urgent need for monitoring and studying these changes as part of broader environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is good to see this here on HN. We, the hackers and painters, would have the power to build world wide communities for addressing the climate collapse (the climate that provided good conditions for humanity to thrive). We have the wealth to work on solutions, we are the ones also contributing to burn the world, maybe because we have given up or because it is just too comfortable. We sit in our offices, home offices, letting everything collapse as long as the pizza and the next gadget reaches our desk. We control how information is distributed, we are responsible. We would be advised to take action; will we?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately we needed large scale climate engineering a decade ago.Oil is a key driver of economic activity, how would we ever convince governments, businesses, and finally individuals to cut their earnings before they “get theirs”. Sure we can get a significant portion of individuals to live a net-zero life, but there are far too many people who don’t care since everything seems normal if you are not paying attention.I want carbon neutrality, but I have no hope to achieving this before we face large scale ecological collapse (look at the GBR).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is why there is a race on for Greenland. (And Svalbard?)Ice melting in the Arctic is not a linear process. There will most likely be ice free summers in the Arctic within most people here's lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43499966</guid></item><item><title>41.

(and before it, .cursorrules)https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The over engineering here is commendable for something that provides most likely marginal value whilst still needing more api calls to summarize everything you do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks interesting but somewhat complicated or not obvious how to get going in a classic "Show HN" style.The requirement for an OpenAI key may also be a little off-putting, or at least, could do with some indication of realistic costs; most Cursor users will likely need a significant motivation to add to the subscription they already have.Don't get me wrong, this could be a really worthwhile addition to the LLM coding toolset but I think it needs some work on the presentation as to how to get quickly up and running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43506068</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses a method for using images as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to gather spatial and motion data. It outlines the approach of leveraging visual information from images to capture movement and orientation, presenting potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and motion tracking. The content explains the technical aspects of the method, including algorithms used for processing image data and examples of successful implementations, emphasizing the advantages of using image-based data over traditional IMUs.&lt;/p&gt;

The guy that I know doing this the best, Eugene Vendrovsky ended up at Nvidia as a robotics computer vision division director. Back in the early 2000's he had all kinds of camera motion recovery algorithms we used in the Tracking department for use on feature films like the live action Scooby Doo, Riddick and the Narnia films. Eugene retired recently, after a very productive career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going to read this in depth. I have been on and off trying to find a way to distinguish between in focus, motion blur (camera shake) and out of focus. Motion blur is surprisingly tricky to distinguish using a computer from the others.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Unbearable Loudness of Chewing" discusses the phenomenon of misophonia, a condition where individuals experience strong emotional reactions to specific sounds, particularly those related to chewing or eating. It explores the psychological and neurological aspects of misophonia, detailing how everyday sounds can trigger feelings of anger or disgust in affected individuals. The piece also examines potential causes, coping strategies, and the impact of this condition on social interactions. Through personal anecdotes and expert insights, the article aims to raise awareness about misophonia and its effects on daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most frustrating thing about it is that very many people take it extremely personally if there's even a whisper of a suggestion that they could eat more quietly. To the extent some people will "revenge chew" to make a point that it could be worse. For some reason, that's a huge taboo, and it seems to cross all cultures. The only relationship I can think of where you can say "close your mouth when chewing" and not risk major offense is a parent-child one.The only thing I find to improve it is to not be tired or stressed when eating with others, or lively conversation as a distraction. Easy, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's completely psychological for me (as in, not a medical mystery). I have a strong, deep-seated association between loud eating and inconsiderateness, because it's often unnecessary (ostensibly). Grossness is part of it, but that's secondary - more of a multiplier rather than being the core problem. It's about the perceived unnecessary-ness: Chewing with your mouth open, biting the spoon, vocalizing, slurping, talking with your mouth full. However, there are other reasons for these things: Cultural, physiological. One often probably doesn't even notice one is doing it. Also, if it doesn't bother you, you may not even be aware that it bothers somebody else (or have trouble sympathizing).The trouble is willing myself into accepting these reasons. The thought "Why are you doing that. Don't you notice?" is nigh unavoidable. It takes conscious effort to not show signs of irritation externally. Sometimes I simply have to politely remove myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I regret constantly hitting my little brother when he was chewing with his mouth open at the dinner table. I was about 13 and had developed misophonia, he must have been 5. Our parents didn't understand it. I didn't understand it. I couldn't control myself for years. He was a sweet boy in a poor and dysfunctional family that also fell apart around that time. At the very least, he deserved a better brother.Decades later, I still get abruptly and irrationally angry when people smack their lips, though I have learnt to suppress the urge to assault the source of the sound.I can't eat with my Chinese colleagues. I get that more air makes each bite taste better, but it is hard to eat or even focus when your brain is telling you to rip their heads off to stop the sound.It's an odd curse to live with, as, aside from the situation with my brother, I have otherwise never hurt or assaulted anyone in my life and am generally regarded as a softy. I have to force myself to sit at the dinner table with my mother when she visits, as she still smacks her lips.Some people smack their lips in quick succession when they taste something new, like how birds drink water, and it drives me up the walls. Slurping is triggering, but not as much. Some people swallow excessively as presenters and will make a "tsk" sound with their tongues before speaking, which is worse than slurping and usually causes me to stop watching the presentation.I'm glad there is some traction with misophonia research. We need help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470493</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a unique marketing experiment by Levi's, where the brand is testing a direct-sales strategy through Amazon by offering a curated selection of jeans. This initiative aims to explore new retail channels and reach a wider audience while leveraging Amazon's vast platform. The piece highlights how this approach could transform consumer shopping experiences and impact traditional retail, alongside insights into Levi's branding strategy and customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Denim head) Anecdata - buying Levis from Amazon (or any other store), pick up at least a couple of pairs in the same size. It's likely different people/factories making them, but often you'll find variation in size/denim even when the labelling in the same. One pair of 32/32 might feel 'off' and the next is the best pair you've ever owned. Completely agree with going 'smaller' brand if you want consistency though (and that's a whole different world).But better tip - (if you're not looking for 'smart' denim) buy from eBay. Only buy pairs where everything has been measured properly (waist, inside leg, rise, etc) so you can get close to what you know you fits. You can find 20+ year old Levis for less than $20 - the denim is heavier, the quality is good and they have that perfect 'broken in' feel that makes the jeans feel like your best friend. Plus you can afford to try a few pairs to find ones you love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [...] one pair ordered from Amazon, one pair sent by Levi’s for each style. [...] It seemed the tipster was half right. The tests confirmed a lot of variability between two pairs of the same jeans — you could buy the same style from Amazon and Levi’s and feel a difference. But it didn’t add up to gaps in quality; there was no indication that the Levi’s from Amazon were worse.All this time, researchers have been wasting money on sample sizes larger than 1 before drawing conclusions.Also, I find the word "commingling" nowhere in the article.  It's very relevant to the question of what product you're receiving when you buy from Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if Levis are, but I have absolutely ordered other branded items that are different on amazon compared to in a store, including entirely different and lower quality fabric on amazon.It's not at all surprising for anything to happen after co-mingled inventory, which should absolutely be illegal.Walmart created a business practice where many black Friday deals were lower quality products produced explicitly for black Friday sales. So underhanded deceptive business practice in large retailers isn't anything new.Without a regulatory authority we can expect companies to act in decreasingly bad faith, because who will provide consequences, the other definitely not colluding competitor?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504451</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, this might suggest some male wasps' seventh abdominal segment is conserved.Modern female wasps having other than six abdominal segments I believe to be unknown, and is certainly unknown to me; while fertilized or "foundress" females do share with males the need for extra body space to support functioning and thus unusually large reproductive organs, females specialized for the reproductive role display morphological differences beginning from larvahood to accommodate the task. (In eusocial species, reproductive females or 'gynes' differ from workers or 'ergates' in having the ability to be inseminated; in subsocial species, gynes are raised and fed for the role from birth and as a result simply grow up extra big and strong, with noticeably larger abdomens in body proportion than their sisters whose labor is less deferred.)edit: Fixed a bug resulting from a Wikipedia editor doing a lousy job with taxonomy. It is actually possible that some lineal relationship exists between structures described here and those of modern male wasps with a seventh gastral segment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It wasn't clear to me how this was like a Venus fly trap: the wasp grabbed prey with a rib cage and... what? Hung on to it till it's larvae developed and consumed the victim ... or what? Sorry, can someone ELI5?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43508817</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses JEP 483, which introduces a mechanism for Ahead-of-Time (AOT) class loading and linking in Java. It explains how this feature improves application startup time and reduces runtime memory overhead by allowing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to perform these processes earlier in the compilation stages. The post details the technical aspects of the implementation, its potential benefits for developers, and examples demonstrating how AOT class loading can enhance performance in Java applications. Additionally, it highlights compatibility considerations and future implications for the Java ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the big problem here is conceptual. The JDK folks are looking at this akin to PGO when, IMHO, they should be looking at this as an AOT cache (yes, the flag names make this even more confusing). How do those two differ, you ask?With PGO you do a lot of deliberate work to profile your application under different conditions and feed that information back to the compiler to make better branch/inlining decisions.
With a AOT cache, you do nothing up front, and the JVM should just dump a big cache to disk every time it exits just in case it gets stared again on the same host. In this case, training runs would just be a” run you did to create the cache". With that said, the big technical challenge right ow is that building the AOT cache is expensive hence performance impacting and cannot really be done alongside a live application - but that’s where I think the focus should be, making filling the aot cache something less intensive and automatic.Another aspect this strategy would help with is “what to do with these big AOT cache files”, if the AOT cache really starts caching every compiled method, it will become essentially another so file possibly of a size greater than the original JAR it started off with. Keeping this is in a docker image will double the size of the image slowing down deployments. Alternatively, with the aot cache concept, you just need to ensure there is some form of persistent disk cache across your hosts. The same logic also significantly helps CLIs, where I dont’ want to ship a 100MB CLI + Jlink bundle and have to add another 50MB of aot cache in it - what I do want is every time the client uses my CLI the JVM keeps improving the AOT cache.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The AOT cache file has a size of 66 MB in this case. It is considered an implementation detail and as such is subject to change between Java versions.Does this mean this is mostly focused on containerised environments? I assume it means you couldn't upgrade the JVM on a server and know that this will keep working?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503960</guid></item><item><title>48.

Off the top of my head, there are other concepts you could discuss: emergence, complexity, weak interactions, statistical machines, encoding, networks, etc.Its clearly a thorough essay, but not the interdisciplinary work I was hoping for.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of mastering coding skills independently before leveraging AI tools to enhance coding productivity. It emphasizes that understanding the fundamentals of programming allows developers to utilize AI effectively, promoting a symbiotic relationship where skills and technology complement each other. The piece encourages readers to focus on foundational knowledge in order to fully harness the potential of AI in their coding practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you spend time on places that attract newbie programmers (some subreddits focused on game dev or game engines, for example) you’ll see the outcome of “I no longer think you should learn to code.” And it’s not pretty.Many, many posts of people looking for help fixing AI-generated code because the AI got it wrong and they have no idea what the code even does. Much of the time the problem is simply an invented method name that doesn’t exist, a problem that is trivially solved by the error message and documentation. But they say they’ve spent several days or whatever going back and forth with the AI trying to fix it.It’s almost a little sad. If they just take the time to actually learn what they’re doing they’ll be able to accomplish so much more.Now of course people learning the traditional way have these same problems, but they’re debugging code they wrote, not gobbledygook from an AI. It’s also easier to explain the solution to them because they wrote the code, so it tends to be simpler. Several times I’ve pitied someone asking for help with AI code and even when I explained the solution they still didn’t understand it, and I had to just give up on them - I’m not getting paid to help them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a professor at a small college. I teach intro programming most semesters and we're now moving to using tools like Cursor with no restrictions in upper-level courses."How do students learn to code nowadays?" - I think about this pretty much all the time.In my intro class, the two main goals are to learn about structured programming (using loops, functions, etc.) and build a mental model of how programs execute. Students should be able to look at a piece of code and reason through what it does. I've moved most of the traditional homework problems into class and lab time, so I can observe the students coding without using AI. The out-of-class projects are now bigger and more creative and include specific steps to teach students how to use AI collaboratively.My upper-level students are now doing more ambitious and challenging projects. What we've seen is that AI moves the difficulty of programming away from remembering details of languages or frameworks, but rewards having a careful, structured development process:- Thinking hard and chatting about the problem and the changes you need to implement before doing anything- Keeping components encapsulated and thinking about interfaces- Controlling the scope of your changes; current AIs work best at the function or class level- Testing and validation- Good manual debugging skills; you can't rely on AI to fix everything for you- General system knowledge: networking, OS, data formats, databasesOne of my key theories is that AI might lower the value of "computer science" as a standalone major, but will lead to a lot more coding across fields that currently don't use it. The intersection of "not a traditional engineer" and "can work with AI to solve problems with code" is going to be an emerging skill set that will change a lot of disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rise of tools like Cursor reminds me of the Industrial Revolution in France. When machines first appeared in factories, unskilled workers who didn’t understand how they operated often got injured - sometimes quite literally losing fingers. But for skilled craftsmen, these machines became force multipliers, dramatically increasing productivity and improving overall living standards.The same applies to software development. If you lack the fundamentals - how memory, I/O, networking, and databases work - you’re at risk of building something fragile that will break under real-world conditions. But for those who understand the moving parts, tools like Cursor supercharge efficiency, allowing them to focus on high-level problem-solving rather than boilerplate coding.Technology evolves, but the need for deep knowledge remains. 
Those who invest in learning the craft will always have the advantage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503295</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Debugger is REPL is Debugger" discusses the relationship between debuggers and Read-Eval-Print Loops (REPLs) in programming environments. It emphasizes that both tools serve similar purposes in aiding developers to interactively explore and test code. The author highlights how debugging can be viewed as a form of interactive programming, paralleling the dynamic nature of REPLs, and suggests that integrating these concepts can enhance the debugging experience. The article ultimately advocates for a deeper understanding of these tools to improve programming efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

Super useful for debugging specific scenarios so you don't need to set up the context repeatedly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43469866</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related, "Django's REST (Framework) Problem" — https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510495I'm not sure that many people who rely on Django Rest Framework are aware that last month the bug tracker was made private and the project is looking for new maintainers.I love Django but the project needs to go through something similar to Angular's renaissance (and Angular needs to learn from Django docs.) I'd love to help but it seems that most of the efforts to address the issue have been stalled in committee.A fork probably isn't the answer but something needs to be done. If it's a money issue, pass the plate! Whenever I talk to Django devs about contributing the feeling that I'm left with is that I could put in years of work, jump through every hoop, and at the end of it they may still say "We're not sure."The feeling that I've gotten is that the Django dev community is very small and tight-knit. Whenever I've talked about helping out on various projects I've walked away with the feeling that their friend is handling it and they'd rather leave them to it. The community has been trained, through years of reinforcement, to wait instead of getting involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've some mixed feelings about this fork. On the one hand, I get the motivations, there is alway a lot of value in experimenting outside of a legacy project. But at the same time, I cant help but feel uneasy seeing something I've deeply respected and used on for years being split off in this way, "fork of Django" is a big statement.Part of that discomfort comes from a sense that the collective effort into Django is being sidestepped rather than built upon. It feels like a "saas-fication" effort, like Ruff, Docker, Terraform, etc but instead of going from creating something new it replaces something that already works. I worry about the potential for a more commercial or narrow direction that doesn't embody honestly the open, thoughtful mission thats made Django so special.I'm in love of boring software.I care about Django more than I realized. Seeing this has actually pushed me with a gut emotion to want to get more involved contributing code, writing, or just participating more with DjangoIt's not about the tool or the language, I want to feel different about the community that is open and respectful of contribution and values long term relations.It's not fun to be boring, but boring is good&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems weird to me. The strength of Django is the ORM and the ecosystem/idioms.Why would I break compatibility with the latter by taking a fork?I would love to see better admin (so many have tried to do this) but it’s unclear to me why the goodstuff here can’t be a Django project template.  (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/releases/1.4/#custom-p...)As a longtime user if I want anything different these days it’s a lighter-weight experience like Django Ninja or FastAPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512589</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unconventional editing practices and experiences of the Apple TV+ series "Severance," which has generated intrigue and attention. It explores how the show's unique narrative structure and thematic elements draw viewers into a complex world, highlighting the surreal nature of work-life balance and the psychological implications of corporate culture. The piece emphasizes the creative choices made during production and the resulting impact on audience engagement, while also reflecting on broader trends in remote work and media consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Keynote to make my presentations, and one time I wanted to build a presentation with someone else.  I asked my friend who has worked at Apple for 20 years, "How do you guys build Keynote presentations together?  There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do that?".He said, "We don't collaborate at Apple because of the (perceived) risk of leaks.  None of our tools are built for collaboration".  Apple is famously closed about information sharing, to the point where on some floors every office requires its own badge, and sometimes even the cabinets within.So it doesn't surprise me that their video editing tools are designed for a single user at a time.Edit:  This happened about six years ago, they have since added some collaboration tools, however it's more about the attitude at Apple in general and why their own tools lag on collaboration.Edit 2:  After the replies I thought I was going crazy.  I actually checked my message history and found the discussion.  I knew this happened pre-COVID, but it was actually in 2013, 12 years ago.  I didn't think it was that long ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ex VFX person here.It was quite common to have remote desktop cards on high end machines so that you could hide them away somewhere quiet. The edit stations/Flame/Baselite machines all hada  fucktonne of 15k sas drives in them, so were really noisy.You couldn't invite a director to see what you were doing, when all you can hear is disk/fan whine.They were quite expensive because they needed to be able to encode and send 2k video in decent bitdepth (ie not 420, but 444), and low latency. Worse still they needed to be calibrateable so that you could make sure that the colour you saw was the colour on the other end.Alas, I can't remember what they are called, thankfully, because they are twats to manage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, but this misses perhaps the most embarrassing part: They're using Avid and not FCP.I also don't buy the author's rationale for remote editing; it's oddly archaic: "high-end video production is quite storage-intensive, which is why your favorite YouTuber constantly talks about their editing rigs and network-attached storage. By putting this stuff offsite, they can put all this data on a real server."Storage is cheap now, and desktop computers are more than powerful enough for any video editing. Any supposed advantage of remote "real servers" is going to be squandered by having to send everything over the Internet. The primary benefit of remote editing (and the much-hyped "camera to cloud") is fast turnaround, which you need for stuff like reality TV and news. But a dramatic series like Severance?It is pretty baffling that Apple would create a PR vehicle that impugns its products like this. It would be better to say nothing. After Apple acquired Shake, they splashed Lord of the Rings, King Kong, and other major tentpoles on the Apple homepage at every opportunity... of course not mentioning that Weta was rendering those movies on hundreds of Linux servers instead of Macs. But at least Shake was the same product across all platforms, and it really was the primary effects tool on all those movies."they do not mention the use of Jump Desktop, which seems like a missed opportunity to promote a small-scale Mac developer. C’mon Apple, do better.)Oh boy, this is just a minor infraction in Apple's history of disrespect toward developers. They do this, and worse, to major development partners too. I'm not going to name names, but after one such partner funded the acquisition of material on its own equipment and that material was used in a major product keynote... Apple not only neglected to credit or even mention that partner, but proceeded to show the name of a totally uninvolved competitor in its first slide afterward. The level of betrayal there was shocking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517301</guid></item><item><title>3.

The UI feels so delightful and well thought out. I guess I found another weekend (multi-week?) activity.If you're looking for hackathon projects, the E-ink ecosystem is well developed enough that they're pretty easy to program against and Claude/the AIs can pick up the API surface. Plus, people generally don't know what they're looking at -- you have to say "kindle-style screen" -- but people (me? but also guests) do seem to prefer having a e-ink screen in the living room over a backlit display because it's so much less intrusive.FWIW, E-ink [0] AND pomdoros [1] are each a whole thing of mine.[0] https://sambroner.com/posts/raspberry-pi-train[1] https://sambroner.com/posts/personal-analytics-2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always interested to see a "device" type of project on here -- they tend to be the most challenging, even if the goal is simple. The intersection of object design, electronics and code is a great playground.I really like the choice of screen, and generally the considerations given (and explained in the readme!) for purpose and usability.Couple of notes on the object design (and this is something I find very challenging, and spend a lot of time iterating on)- What if the knob was on top of the device, wide and flat? you could center the screen, make the device smaller, and the physical action of turning it would be less likely to push the box around- Chamfers and fillets go a long way to make a thing look polished -- it's a small detail, but the difference between a sharp edge and a rounded one somehow seems to matter a lot.- Since the menu always has three options, what if instead of the knob there were three buttons on the top surface (like the "snooze" of an alarm clock)? Fewer interactions to fiddle with!- You can get translucent filament, and it makes for very cool "light conduit" parts -- eg, the LED box could be solid, and it would look like something from an 80s dashboard. Alternately, you could print a border for the screen, and light that up instead, making for a more minimalist design.(Sorry, I can't help it, I like thinking about these things)How did you design the knob, OpenSCAD? The knurling is a nice touch, and looks like it was done in a programmatic way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43514383</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in how the mountains and rivers are generated, it's mostly based on the paper "Large Scale Terrain Generation from Tectonic Uplift and
Fluvial Erosion": Each chunk rises (at a noise-based, constant rate) while erosion is applied based on the chunk's slope and the size of its catchment area.The result is a river network as well as the central height of each chunk; based on this roads, caves and structures are laid out. The actual voxels are only determined when a player loads the area and are (usually) not persisted.Also, for some technologies not related to worldgen: Rendering is done via wgpu, models are built in MagicaVoxel, and both client and server use an ECS (specs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minor note that installation via the launcher (Why a launcher!?!) seems a bit broken. Both the direct mac download, and installing from Cargo, installs Airshipper v0.15.0. This says that it's outdated and to install a new version. Clicking the button to do this takes you to the Github releases page, where the latest version is 0.14. There's a december release for v0.16 but it's a tag only and has no artifacts.

I really like the idea of implementing higher level features as extensions on top of a smaller core. I wish real scripting languages like this were more common and in use.

Don't actually do this, this is bad advice.Just like a lecturer won't suddenly switch to a German accent when saying words like "schadenfreude" or names like "Friedrich Nietzsche", neither should a screen reader. Having your voice constantly change under you for no apparent reason is distracting more than anything else.What you should do this for are longer pieces of text in a foreign language, like a multi-paragraph piece of text to analyze in a foreign language textbook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richard Zach et al. logic textbooks are a work of art: https://slc.openlogicproject.org.Aside, I'd be happy to pay for great classic math textbooks in a well typeset edition.Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces is one such example.

That was a fun time.The physical board and magnets definitely add a cool factor to it as does the physical dexterity element. Nice project![1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Chess&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; so this should be a pretty uncontroversial minor rules updateMy kind of humor.Always found it an interesting aspect of chess that the most "common sense" rules (Players take turns; no skipping; one move per turn) result in the most unintuitive outcomes and a massive increase in complexity: Suddenly you can reason about the pieces a player won't be able to move in a turn, you can double-bind players, you get draws where its provably impossible for any player to win, etc.(In that sense, chess is a bit like the IntercalScript language earlier today: All features are superficially reasonable and in the service of simplicity, yet result in the weirdest outcomes)Wouldn't all this be gone for  chess without turns?Or would strategies become even more intricate, e.g. taking into account the minimum time you'd require to physically move a piece?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43514695</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN!We have released the initial version of the Postgres Language Server we started working on almost two years ago[0]. You can try it out by downloading the binary from the repo[1]. It is also available on npm, as a vscode extension and via nvim-lspconfig and mason.[2]We fell into plenty of rabbit holes along the way, but dug our way out of each. We're now using mostly pragmatic, almost naive solutions for our problems.You can find more details in this blog post.[3]Try it out and let us know what breaks. Bug reports, ideas, and contributions are all welcome-especially if you want to hack on some Rust.Last, but not least, we want to give a shoutout to Biome[4]. We spent a lot of time studying their codebase and have been adopting many of their approaches. We wouldn't be here without their work.[0] Announcement Show HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37020610[1] Repository: https://github.com/supabase-community/postgres-language-serv...[2] Installation Guides: https://pgtools.dev/#installation[3] Blog Post: https://www.supabase.com/blog/postgres-language-server[4] Biome: https://biomejs.dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;co-author here: The most interesting part is probably the parsing of SQL files.The first issue is that the Postgres parser is complex and always changing, so you can't really roll your own parser to parse SQL. 
The second is that the parser only works with valid and complete SQL statements, but an LSP should help you with those that are invalid or incomplete.The simple solution is to actually use two parsers – the original   libpg_query   that's used by Postgres itself, and   tree-sitter   for incomplete statements, and merge the parsed results.
With that, you can both get a workable AST for diagnostics and tree-sitters CST for autocompletion, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;This project provides a toolchain for Postgres development,I'm a little bit confused about what "Postgres development" is in this context. Is this for people writing stored procedures in Postgres? Or people writing other kinds of large and complex queries that merit language server support?I'm just kind of curious what uses cases are out there for something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513996</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of "carcinisation" as it applies to Sony's PlayStation brand, suggesting that over time, it has evolved to resemble a more commercially driven and less innovative entity, akin to how some species evolve into crab-like forms. The author critiques recent developments and trends in the PlayStation ecosystem that prioritize profit over creative risk-taking, indicating a shift towards a more formulaic and homogenized gaming experience. The piece reflects on the broader implications of this trend within the gaming industry and the potential consequences for players and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the perfect background noise cancelling tool, and now is asking permissions to record your whole screen and audio, for AI meeting companion features I couldn’t care about one bit. And they make it such a frustrating pain to opt-out, with constant modals tricking you in enabling all those AI features.Does anyone know an alternative that achieves similar level of background noise cancelling?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; low algorithmic latency of just 15 millisecondsI guess overall latency will be higher since processing will have to go to their server than back to our server then back from our server to STT provider and back to as then back to LLM provider and back to us and last part to TTS provider and back to the user.It's so weird that e.g. OpenAI doesn't provide a way to make very simple voice pipeline STT + LLM + TTS executed totally on their servers, this would reduce latency significantly.The pipeline with this server side audio processing right now looks mostly would have to look like that:user phone -&gt; our server -&gt; krisp server -&gt; our server -&gt; OpenAI STT -&gt; our server -&gt; OpenAI LLM -&gt; our server -&gt; OpenAI TTS -&gt; our server -&gt; back to user.Then you have to hope that user and all servers are hosten in the same region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently I was practicing QA with ChatGPT, I wondered if I say "stay silent for 4 seconds before talking" will it work? lo and behold, it didn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43467988</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just wanted to note: the entire configuration I'm building out is automated to run on any Debian/Ubuntu OS (not just a Pi), and my intent is to make NTP + PTP setup much more approachable for those who want to tinker with it.The project is on GitHub: https://github.com/geerlingguy/time-piThe blog post has more color/story around it, but the meat of it is over on GitHub, and right now I'm working my way through testing different network switches, installing an external GPS antenna, etc.Also, if you're a PTP nerd, you might want to check out a project from the OCP-TAP, the Switchberry, an open hardware design for a PTP boundary/transparent clock with 7 ports! [1] This was built by the same PCB designers as the TimeHAT featured in my blog post, and I'm trying to hammer out some bugs in the bringup so they can be nice, lower-cost options for networks where you don't have the budget or need for enterprise-level PTP offerings, but still want a decent DIY setup.[1] https://github.com/Time-Appliances-Project/Incubation-Projec...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're looking to setup a GPS-disciplined time-server at home, I highly recommend this writeup: https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/14/revisiting-microse...In the author's latest post he also sets up a pi as PTP grandmaster: https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/18/nanosecond-accurat...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fully expect the results would make anyone with deep knowledge of PTP laugh at loud at how inaccurate/imprecise it is, but I still love for wifi to get a PTP.There's so much audio and video stuff that works so much better with ptp. Even if it's vastly less good, its still gotta be some way to keep systems running on the same time, and that's a huge win. I'd love to see wifi PTP happen.There's some really incredible research work a team did a while back, hacking their own PTP implementation stop a specific driver (adding timestamps to ath9k). https://github.com/zlab-pub/wifi-ptp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510036</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;99% of this does not depend on Oracle, you can do this on any vm hosting platform you can get. The only point of using Oracle is the price point which will vanish as soon as they can cease using it to build market share. Good to show btw. Nice instructions. They're  mostly platform neutral. It might be a different interface to manage on another host of course but the outcome would be much the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has got me reading about TURN and it just seems like a huge ugly hack. Two computers want to send UDP to each other. They are electrically connected by sets of physical cables. They could even be down the street from each other. But they don’t know how to get their routers to set the right bits in their translation tables. Instead it’s just easier to send all their traffic through a third computer in another city thousands of miles away or maybe into outer space and back. Have I got it right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Additionally, some people have privacy concerns about running their data through anything associated with the big G.It's important to point out that Web RTC is E2E encrypted, so Google never actually sees your data.As long as the server you use for signaling is secure, your TURN server may as well be run by the NSA. Since initial signaling is extremely low-bandwidth compared to the actual call, it's usually fine to handle it in your application directly.THe actual problem with WebRTC is that, in its default setup, every call participant leaks their IP address to everybody else, and you need to upload your data n-1 times for n call participants, making it almost unusable on slow connections. You can mitigate both of these problems with an SFU, essentially a central server that takes in streams from all clients and distributes them further, but then you lose the E2E.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510710</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for testing software without using mocks, specifically in the context of nullable types in programming. It emphasizes the benefits of testing real instances of objects rather than relying on mock objects, which can lead to more reliable and maintainable tests. The author provides practical examples and techniques for implementing this approach, highlighting how it can simplify testing and improve code quality by focusing on actual behavior rather than simulated interactions. Overall, the piece advocates for a testing philosophy that embraces real-world scenarios to enhance the development process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty fond of this article. I think it's an interesting approach, and I think you can generalize it out into some very useful principles.The big takeaway, I think, is that a particular module of code should encapsulate its own test double configuration &amp; injection behind a set of testing factories. So rather than this:    m = new FooMock()
    m.call("Bar", 1, 2)
    m.call("Baz", 3)
    p = new thing.ThingDoer(m)
    actual = p.doThing()
    assert(expected == actual)

Do something like this:    p = thing.makeThingDoerForTest(1, 2, 3)
    actual = p.doThing()
    assert(expected == actual)

Shore's "nullables" are a version of this, but to me it doesn't really matter what makeThingDoerForTest is doing internally to build the mocked-up test version of a ThingDoer. What matters is that the test doesn't have to worry about it: It's the Thing module's responsibility to correctly set up the test doubles involved. The unit test can use a special constructor that exposes only the minimum necessary configuration, and then implementation details about how ThingDoer interacts with Foo can be hidden inside the Thing module, as they should be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is a very thorough article. Aside from using unfamiliar terms, nearly every concept is valuable and familiar. I am a big proponent of not mocking / no mocking frameworks/libraries. 15+ years of building large SaaS systems with hundreds of contributors and optimizing for testing so deployment is the best balance of safe and fast.I use nearly every pattern mentioned to write my tests in Go. I now use the same patterns in Python where I can - this new org is less mature in its testing solution and mocks and spaghetti abound.For similar, Go specific resources look up, "Go fakes vs mocks."Other related reading on reasons to avoid mocks: https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.htmlfwiw, not a fan of a couple techniques like nullables and prefer Fakes/Fake Constructors, but it is splitting hairs. Overall the message is correct: avoid mocking. Have a way for systems under test to have implementation details changed while interfaces remain the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, a breath of fresh air. I read this before I went to sleep, hoping to wake up to some kind of revelation I might share in a comment like this, but no luck. I'm still torn.I remember writing tests in not very powerful languages like Java in 2005. Back then the idea was that you just need to decouple your objects, add interfaces for everything, and you will reap good design, courtesy of being forced to by TDD. What I usually saw was an overly complex code base with dependency injection and difficult to debug problems at runtime.This article seems like the natural evolution of this thinking, but turning it around: It's not saying a unit that wants to be tested needs to enable tests. It's saying a unit used by other units needs to support _them_ being tested. Maybe I'm easy to impress, but I find that refreshingly novel, wondering why I never thought of it.OTOH, with powerful mocking frameworks and more dynamic features even in static languages, the part of the industry I've been a witness to took another turn: Let units do whatever they want, focusing just on what's needed in production, and in order to test them, we'll build an elaborate fake environment for them. The major downside being that people changing a unit need to worry about whatever elaborate fakes _other_ units have created for them in their tests.So it's coupling vs decoupling production code and tests. The former approach makes it easier to author and maintain test suites. The latter approach makes it easier to reason about production code.In the last decade or so, I've valued the latter more, despite the drawbacks. With this style, coupling production code and tests is suddenly on the table for me again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470192</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Conquest of the Incas" explores the historical events surrounding the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in the 16th century. It highlights key figures, such as Francisco Pizarro, and discusses the strategies, battles, and cultural impacts resulting from the conquest.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is fascinating that a large percentage of modern Americans believe (taught in school or through Disney movies) that prior to the arrival of Europeans; native American tribes were peaceful to each other.They often think that the land was inhabited by loving tribes that just wanted to be left alone to live in harmony with nature.The truth is that barbarism was common as tribes routinely slaughtered each other in numerous wars. Slavery, rape and human sacrifice were here far before the White man arrived.I am not saying that the conquerers from Europe didn't do some horrible things too; just that the narrative often taught in schools is inaccurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s almost kind of more impressive that the Incan empire of maybe 10 million people got by on the barter system.In _Debt_, Graeber argues that it is largely a myth that pre modern civilizations relied on barter, and instead used different systems for tracking debt between individuals and entities.He says this of the Incas knotted strings in a footnote:&gt; I note in passing that a study of the Inca khipu system itself would itself be quite fascinating in this regard; the strings were used to record both obligations we would consider financial, and others we would consider ritual, since as in so many Eurasian languages, the words “debt” and “sin” were the same in Quechua as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you enjoyed the article, consider listening to the Fall of civilisations podcast.

Both heavily frown upon that when receiving mail themselves. Do as we say...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago, when iCloud custom domains first launched, I found a bug where Apple would permanently cache the MX record. If an iCloud user had ever used a custom domain, future emails from iCloud to that domain would still get routed to their iCloud inbox—even if the domain’s MX record no longer pointed to Apple. They eventually fixed it, but didn’t think it deserved a bounty, which was a bit surprising.I'm sure there's a ton of interesting surface area here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, Apple sends the wrong EHLO domain when trying to send emails out. This results in them dropping emails to their own users. Can't get past Apple's level 1 support.

Such a great journey, everything he crafted carried something more than what you saw and heard, there's always a thread or the power to make it feel like there was a thread beyond the frame.Outside of all the typical Lynch stuff, one thing I always suggest people watch is The Straight Story. It's such a wonderful movie, one I hoped at release would find a much bigger audience as it really deserves to be seen and shows that Lynch wasn't a guy who just made weird things, he made great things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What about the 1999 PlayStation 2 advertisement disguised as a futuristic 2078 commercial for the PlayStation 9 [1]?

Then, as the class was winding up, he joked and said "just kidding, don't do that... here's how we can do this with a Taylor expansion", and proceeded to derive the same identity in what felt like 30 seconds.Also, don't forget the Jacobian and gradient aren't the same thing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those looking for a shorter primer could consult https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01528&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3b1b classic on this topic with beautiful visualizations: https://youtu.be/O85OWBJ2ayo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518220</guid></item><item><title>23.

Thus, before the spacecraft runs out of fuel, they have moved it away from L2 into its final graveyard  orbit.It is not capable of performing the science for which it was designed in its graveyard orbit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also overwrote the EEPROM of the satellite computer before shutting it, because apparently they were concerned that the satellite would reawake, because it has multiple autonomous recovery modes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great images from the project here:https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485514</guid></item><item><title>24.

We use extended Kalman filters (i.e. non-blackbox "ML") to estimate certain lab values of patients that are highly indicative of them crashing, based on live data from whatever set of monitors they're hooked up to - and it's highly robust.What the authors of this paper are doing is throwing stuff at the wall to see if it works, and publishing results. That's not necessarily a bad thing at all, but I say this to underline that their results are not at all reflective of SOTA capabilities, and they're not doing much exploration of prior art.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I missing something or is this just "We built models that are bad"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For IHM prediction, LSTM models and transformer models were trained for 100 epochs using the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets separately.I might be blind, but I don't see any mention of loss. Did they stop at 100 because it was a nice round number or because it was a good place to stop?The LSTM model they used had 7k trainable parameters, the CW-LSTM model 153k while the transformer model had 800k parameters (300k trainable parameters and 600k optimizer parameters as they say).I don't follow the field close enough, but is it reasonable these models all converged at the same time, given the large difference in size?They mention the transformer model outperforming the LSTMs, but I wonder if it could have done a lot better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482792</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Important caveat: this is not itself a vulnerability; you still need a kernel `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` vulnerability if you want to actually do something evil.(I also expect that if you're already in a restricted AA profile it's not easy to switch to a less-restrictive one, but I think a lot of security tools are bad at thinking about multi-process interpreters)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, entirely, AppArmor profiles for shipped executables allow escape from privileged environments...Without that additional AppArmor 'blessing', wouldn't the standard Linux privileges / container groups prevent this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unprivileged user namespaces are not a security vulnerability. Ubuntu's short-sighted and reactionary decision to ban them makes systems less, not more, secure overall, since with this capability gone, it makes it that much harder for a well-behaved unprivileged program to set up a userspace sandbox. If the kernel has vulnerabilities, fix them. Don't just randomly break useful features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517734</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Thesis: We should create a distro of Linux that runs Windows binaries by default via Wine.On Debian you're one package away:    sudo apt install wine-binfmt

Otherwise you're still pretty close:    echo 'none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0' &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
    mount -a
    echo ':DOSWin:M::MZ::/usr/bin/wine:' &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think a new distro is needed. Most commonly used windows apps can be made to work through wine, but the hacks used to make one app work can break others and vice versa. Similarly, everyone needs to play around with settings individually to get things to work. What works on one person's machine might not work on another's, because there's no consistency in, effectively, configuration.The simplest solution, to me, is to just distribute containers (or some other sandbox) with wine in it, and the necessary shenanigans to get the windows program (just the one) working in the container, and just distribute that. Everyone gets the same artifact, and it always works. No more dicking around with wine settings, because it's baked in for whatever the software is.Yes, this is tremendously space inefficient, so the next step would be a way of slimming wine down for container usage.The only real barrier to this system is licensing and software anti patterns. You might have to do some dark magic to install the software in the container in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First-class support for Windows applications might just become doable, if Wine continues to progress and Win32 doesn't accelerate. There were a handful of quality of life improvements in previous Windows releases, but the biggest Win32 changes feel like they happened quite a while ago by now, and for good reason: Win32 is stable and mature. It's still a moving target, but not by nearly as much, and even if Microsoft wanted to move it for the sake of moving it, they might find more resistance than they can completely overcome. For now, I think Wine is still not good enough to recommend people just use for everything, though. It's incredible, but incredible doesn't make Photoshop install.However, I also think that we could "solve" a lot of the compatibility problems.There are tons of old Linux binaries that don't work anymore. But... They could. A lot of old binaries, surely the vast majority, could absolutely run on a modern kernel. The problem is the userspace. The binaries themselves contain oodles of information that could be used to figure out what they need to run, it's just that there's nothing in place to try to make sure that stuff is available.I really believe we could make it possible for a distro, out of the box, to make old binaries "just work", double-click and run. Want to install an old game from an .rpm or .deb you have? The system could identify what base OS that is and install it into it's own chroot with its dependencies, then create desktop icons for it. Execution failures? Missing libraries? Xlib errors? Let's have a graphical error message with actionable help.Well, it could be done, anyway. If you wanted to follow the spirit of Windows here, it would be the right thing to do, and it'd help users who found a thing that says it supports "Linux" run that thing the way they would hope and expect it to run. Will it actually happen? Not unless someone makes it happen, and convinces distros, desktops and all other stakeholders it's worth shipping, then maintains and improves it going forward. It's a bit depressing when you realize that the technical part of implementing this is basically the least challenging part, at least for a proof of concept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518917</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advancements in deep learning for multi-object tracking (MOT), focusing on the integration of association and detection frameworks through a unified model. It presents a new approach that utilizes a graph neural network to enhance the association between tracked objects across frames while maintaining accurate detection capabilities. The method aims to improve the robustness and efficiency of MOT systems in various applications, particularly in real-time scenarios. Results indicate significant performance improvements on benchmark datasets, emphasizing the potential for this approach to advance the field of tracking in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the upcoming voting process for the OpenWrt project's governance, specifically the election scheduled for February 12, 2025. It highlights the importance of community participation in selecting new members for the OpenWrt leadership team. The article outlines the guidelines for candidates and voters, encouraging individuals within the OpenWrt community to engage actively in the election to ensure diverse representation and effective decision-making for the project's future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GL.iNet is a popular brand, though I can't find a Wikipedia page for it.https://www.gl-inet.com/about-us/ says:&gt; GL Tech (HK) Ltd: #601, 5W, Hong Kong Science Park, N.T. Hong Kong&gt; GL Intelligence, Inc.: 10400 Eaton Place, Suite 215, Fairfax, VA 22030I'm a little curious about this.  One of the reasons that some people run OpenWrt is for improved security.  In the general security space, a Shenzen company isn't the most usual choice of vendor for Western countries.  Also, the company having the US subsidiary/office/unit based in Virginia, and with "intelligence" in the name, hits a somewhat odd note.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome! I've been using OpenWRT for more than a decade, and I  think it's great that they're designing their own hardware now.I'm on a GL.iNet MT-6000 right now, and it's a great router. The stock firmware is based on openwrt, and they make it very easy to upgrade to an official openwrt release. I bought it before the OpenWRT One became available, but I probably would have gone with it anyways because it has two 2.5gb ports whereas the OpenWRT One only has a single 2.5gb port. I'm on 1gb internet right now, so that would be fine for the moment, my ISP has already been advertising 2gb service coming soon, and I'd like to upgrade once it's available.It looks like the MT7988 chip they chose for the OpenWRT Two supports either two 10gb ports or one 10gb and a bunch of other ports, so I think they made the right call. It should be capable of handling up to 5gb internet service, so it'd be a better fit for someone like me.I imagine it'll also be one of the first and likely best OpenWRT devices to support Wi-Fi 7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a reasonable scenario where enough people vote "no" here? It seems unlikely, so a nuanced discussion where pros and cons are considered seems more productive. Seems like a yes/no vote makes more sense if there is actual contention or disagreement among internal factions.If you vote no, you'll basically be seen as the  stickler person without a good reason.18 people are missing (abstained?), so could that be interpreted as an ambiguous "no"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512495</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes but they make a lot of fuzzy decisions, so they are better compared with e.g. alchemists or deep learning researchers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two overlooked aspect of the research:First, an object of the research is pre-human ancestors' tool use:&gt; Physical evidence of early hominin perishable tools is scarce. However, it is reasonable to assume the mechanical constraints surrounding tool use and manufacture have remained somewhat constant. Using a functional framework to understand the technical capabilities of extant hominoid tool users presents a novel approach to predict the perishable tool-using capabilities of our earliest relatives.Note that the Paleolithic, the first period of stone tools, started ~2.58 - 3.3 mya (million years ago); stone can be durable since X mya and we have lots of evidence of that. But our evolutionary line split from the chimps' line ~7 mya (though remember the 7 mya shared ancestor was not a chimpanzee; they evolved too). Before the Paleolithic, and even after it began, our ancestors at times likely used tools made from perishable materials  - I cooked dinner with a wooden spoon, myself.Also, there's the question of culture - something once thought unique to humans:&gt; Our findings provide insights into the technical skills associated with perishable artefact-making and raise questions about how this knowledge is learnt and culturally transmitted.There are two ways to pass down traits: genetics, and culture. If you think culture is somehow weaker or secondary, look at the traditions or look at languages that have lasted thousands of years with no genetic basis. An advantage of the cultural method is flexibility - it can be changed today; biological evolution takes awhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this would be more relatable, like, "chimpanzee
engineers found pretending to managers about estimates, chimpanzee managers found pretending to listen".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43471907</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of securely managing passwords and highlights several best practices for creating strong, unique passwords for different accounts. It emphasizes the use of password managers to assist in storing complex passwords securely and the necessity of enabling two-factor authentication for an added layer of security.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm also 100% convinced Microsoft will introduce mandatory code signing at some point and make it so that you can only ever install software from Windows Store.They are envious of the Google and Apple walled gardens/cashcows and are now determined to turn Windows into one.Windows is no longer a product for users, the users of Windows are the product for Microsoft to be shoved into the Azure sales funnel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's such an absurd lie. If Microsoft's idea of security is to force its users to authenticate online for a local account, they should never be allowed in the software industry at all. They're needlessly and dramatically increasing the attack surface of one of the most security critical software running on user devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago, I needed to get into safe mode to rescue a laptop that wouldn't boot.Since it uses Windows 11, I originally logged in using my Microsoft Account and a Windows Hello pin.Safe mode doesn't load wifi drivers and the laptop didn't have an ethernet port, so I couldn't log in to my Microsoft Account to get into Windows safe mode. Didn't have a dongle with ethernet port at that time, so I had to backup the drive and reinstall Windows instead.That's why I use Linux these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512660</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My extension problem story is a bit different. We distribute an extension that makes it easy to switch between proxy servers for geolocation testing.I ran my worst client demo ever a few months ago. It was like our product simply didn’t work. A lot of pulled hair and frustrating debugging later we discovered that a recent update to the 1Password extension broke ours. They were subscribing to an auth event, but not returning, this timed out so our subscriber was never called. So our extension would tell the browser to change proxy servers, then sit ready to provide credentials, but the request would never come. 1Password’s support team was better than grammerly’s, but it’s hard to convince an unknown PM to prioritize something, especially if you’re speaking to them via a support team.We’ve since discovered that there’s some Russian extension you need for government websites that has the same issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're injecting scripts or styles into unknown pages, the least you can do is namespace your variables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its frightening to see how many screenshares and recordings contain that green infestation as default on every website, not just the obvious visual disturbance (am i the only one who thinks the green is ugly and clashes with most websites colors?) that does not seem to bother users but the privacy and obvious attack vectors that come with it. Chrome can enable extensions only when needed why does no one do this? Why is this not the default on every browser?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43514308</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of subtyping in object-oriented programming and how it enhances code clarity and reuse. It explains that subtyping allows for the creation of more specific types from a general base type, facilitating polymorphism. This improves the ability to manage complex systems and makes code more understandable. The piece also highlights the benefits of subtyping in facilitating better software design and maintenance, ultimately leading to more robust and adaptable applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If a function accepts a value that can be String or null, it is ok to pass it a value that is guaranteed to be a String and not null. Or in other words, String is a subtype of String?!That's... not true? The language can just have an implicit conversion rule for convenience.&gt; properties like nullability that don’t affect memory layoutThat's not true either? It might not affect memory layout because all your objects are boxed or you have niche value optimisation you can use to tag nulls, but make an unboxed integer nullable and you'll definitely see your memory layout be affected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; existing programming languages have little or no subtyping [...] If you remember the fad for Object Oriented ProgrammingI was under the impression that even today, most code is written in an object-oriented style (or at least, written in languages that support OOP). Therefore, most languages support subtyping via inheritance. Is that not true?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like "Why You Need Algebraic Subtyping" might be a better title for this post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485373</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "geeks' naivety," exploring how tech enthusiasts often approach complex societal issues with an overly simplistic mindset. It highlights the tendency of some in the tech community to underestimate the social implications of their innovations and the importance of engaging with broader perspectives. The author warns against assuming that technological solutions alone can address deep-rooted problems, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the intersection between technology and society.&lt;/p&gt;

You either die a normie who doesn't care about privacy, or you live long enough to become a schizo who knows how bad things really are. Try bringing up at the dinner table the NSA dragnet or always-on backdoors embedded in consumer routers and CPUs.Everything is tracked, everything is logged, its been this way for a long time and there's nothing you can do about it. You have zero privacy in the internet and you're an idiot if you think otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google has been around since 1998 with people putting every dark secret and worry into search queries. Not once has someones searches been leaked by employees, despite highly political people working at these companies with a lot to gain by leaking to a journalist or similar.Likewise with private messages on Facebook, order history on Amazon.Big Tech has way more to lose than the small "privacy focused" alternatives, and clearly for them to go this long with this many employees its through design not luck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of discussion here about the motivation of companies and what they can share or remain private in relation to their objectives and making a profit. But, I think to provide a much better argument is what are their actual motivations to have privacy in all of the systems to begin with.Apple and Amazon will at minimum compromise your privacy to improve their products. And since they have no extra motivation since they don't make more or less money (because Siri and Alexa are loss leaders) they will have no extra considerations of privacy regardless.Comparing Signal to protonmail is a much more interesting problem and you can go on to what has been subpoena from Signal and protonmail. Since there was one actually disclosed we can see the information (or really lack of) that was given by Signal [1] . We have a statement by proton mail on what can be subpoena [2] but there have been arguments against it.[1] https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/

&lt;p&gt;Typed Japanese is a project that provides a structured approach to learning the Japanese language through a type-safe grammar framework. It aims to help learners create and use Japanese sentences correctly by utilizing type annotations that correspond to grammatical elements. The project emphasizes clarity and safety in language construction, making it easier for learners to understand and practice Japanese grammar effectively. Additionally, it encourages collaboration and contributions from the community to enhance the learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the factors affecting CPU usage in the BEAM (Bogdan/Bjorn's Erlang Abstract Machine) environment, commonly used for running Erlang and Elixir applications. It provides insight into how the BEAM manages processes, memory, and scheduling, and highlights key considerations for optimizing performance. The blog emphasizes monitoring tools and strategies to analyze CPU utilization effectively, addressing common misunderstandings about BEAM's behavior and offering tips for improving application efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;been reading / work with elixir and was interested in finding out the cause of high cpu usage.TLDR: BEAM VM uses busy waiting under the hood to achieve fast response time when dealing with requests. you can disable it by setting a few options in the VM.Edit:  Interesting thing here is that there's no significant latency difference when toggling busy/wait, so not sure why that's the default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised they didn't measure the tail latency, that's where I'd expect busy waiting to make a difference&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43475982</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection.You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the "Router" field, that's how it works.Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process.As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work.It's a fairly clever setup.If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CarPlay sends a H264/5 video stream from the iPhone to the car's head unit, and receives touchscreen, knob, etc. input in the other direction (afaik). I'm not sure if the video is encrypted, but it seem rather unlikely that the dongle could exfiltrate such an amount of data undetected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something that might be useful to know with these devices is that they're quite liable to bricking during updates.If you do install an update, make sure you reopen its' web portal and confirm the version number is different to what it was before. If it hasn't changed from before, you'll have to wait a while as its still flushing bytes to its flash memory, and if you accidentally trigger an update again here, you'll be left with a brick (speaking from experience).Depending on the device you bought, you might also be able to flash custom firmware on it: https://github.com/ludwig-v/wireless-carplay-dongle-reverse-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470337</guid></item><item><title>39.

I think it’s amazing, you’ve taken this initiative.I would consider purpose here in respect to node.js: I would never run something critical like UPS on node.js, it’s full of bugs and api shelf life is measured in weeks. Auto updates are also not a thing I would do for a plethora odd reasons, the least bit is my UPS daemon has no business connecting to the Internet.I will say, the documentation is beautiful. I’ve set up a dozen Eaton UPSs, and i wouldn’t say UPSC/Nut are hard, but they’re not great either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43511742</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing reliance of physicists and scientists on burner phones due to heightened concerns over privacy and surveillance in America. It highlights how this reflects a broader cultural shift towards caution in communications, driven by fears of government scrutiny and the potential misuse of data. The use of burner phones symbolizes a response to a transforming social landscape where trust and security are increasingly jeopardized, demonstrating how even scientific communities are adapting to new realities of technological intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How about this quote:&gt; Perhaps that’s because most of British academia still can’t get its head around the idea that the US is now an enemy, not an ally, and that the “special relationship” is yesterday’s story.That's a bold statement. John is using language in a manipulative way. By moving the word "enemy" into a context where it is not justified (is it really war, rather than typical negotiations?), he aims to create a dramatic perspective on a thing that is not obviously dramatic. Drama is the basis of the argument. The cases he brings up do not seem to justify the conclusive dramatic language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a US scientist and the use of minimalist phone and a laptop is something I'm planning for all my travel.This is for the simple reason that I have determined, based on a large body of cases that are accumulating at a disturbing rate, that the current US administration considers themselves "above the law". Furthermore, the administration has shown that they are eager to carry out actions that violate due process and freedom of speech against anyone they perceive as opposing their policies/views.EDIT: I'm happy to document such cases for those who have not been paying attention, but I also encourage those who are doubtful to simply search the many examples that have been posted here on HN (unfortunately, many flagged in an attempt to suppress discussion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the important things to watch for is the linkup of the papers please people with the internet scanners. Right now they seem to be limited to seizing your personal effects, but that is a matter of coordination between departments of the government. If there are laws against it, they are adjacent to other laws which were ignored even in previous years. Once that occurs the use of professional use devices will not make the crossing safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517590</guid></item><item><title>42.

Why make it React-dependent/focused? 
How's it better than going with synch engines, like eg. Zero? 
Didn't look at code, sorry, on the go now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do authentication and authorization work? Like Firebase?(I haven't used a system like that. I'm intrigued by the idea of a backend that's just a database but it weirds me out not to have to write a layer that says who can read what. Exposing the database that nakedly feels super dangerous.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does this mean?:&gt; bknd runs directly inside your frontend app — no separate backend required.&gt; It supports PostgresHow is the postgres credentials kept secret from the client?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43471838</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of romance scams that exploit individuals through online dating platforms, specifically highlighting the use of incognito mode to ensconce scammers in anonymity. It explains how scammers create fake profiles to build emotional connections and ultimately manipulate victims for financial gain. The piece underscores the dangers of sharing personal information online and emphasizes the need for vigilance and education about these deceptive practices to protect oneself from falling victim to such schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I struggled to find the source the fact that $1T is lost to scammers. From the FBI internet crime report in 2023 Americans lost about 12.5 Billion dollars [0]. That is far from 1T$.Another source reports cost if cybercrime is reported to reach 9.5T$ in 2024 but again no source provided for that number [1][0] https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3Report.pdf#...[1] https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/2023-official-cyb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My elderly mother has been scammed twice (that I know of).  She fell for one of those "Your computer has been hacked" popup windows a few years ago.  Which led to her buying a "protection" service that installed malware on her machine.  Every couple of months she'd have an "issue" and have to shell out more money to fix it.  She's been using computers since the 80's (Apple ][e) but still is utterly clueless on how to operate a computer.  I had her take her computer to a computer shop to have the OS re-installed but he somehow kinda botched it.  Fortunately I was able to later re-install Windows myself and she hasn't had an issue since.  I've strongly warned her about scammers and now when she doesn't respond to an obvious scammer email she's pleased with herself.  Old people really do become children again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not going to read the "article" because it is a transcript and looks a bit rambly and I don't expect it to be talking about anything interesting. But just going to the headline here; consider the base rate. North America has huge per-capita wealth (by a bit of a margin over most other large players). It is expected that scammers would target them and make the most profit there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513850</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a concerning trend in the decline of cash usage in the UK, linking it to a significant drop in the number of NHS surgeries for children who swallow foreign objects. Health experts suggest that the reduced number of surgeries may be partly attributed to the fact that parents are less likely to seek medical help due to payment methods and the challenges they face during emergencies. The article highlights the implications of this shift away from cash for healthcare access, particularly for urgent care situations involving children.&lt;/p&gt;

You have to be careful not to leave them around. We got a gumball machine that dispenses M&amp;Ms, so at least now they think of coins as “something I should spend” instead of “something I should chew on”.Coins aren’t that toxic… most of the time. An even worse threat is button and coin cell batteries. Those should really leave any parent worried. When disposing of them, they need to be wrapped up in something big enough they can’t be swallowed and then taped up so the coin can’t get out. Lately I’ve been disposing of them in a sharps container I have for getting rid of Stanley knife razor blades, another decent choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s an unnecessarily confusing headline.“Decline of cash credited” makes me think of “cash credited” in accounting.The actual headline is “Decline of cash credited for drop in NHS surgery for children swallowing objects” … which doesn’t provide the context necessary to correct this misunderstanding until after you figure you what “NHS surgery” is.It’s a really bad sentence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518251</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Madison Square Garden's controversial use of facial recognition technology to identify and ban fans from attending events, particularly those who have been vocal critics of the venue's management, specifically James Dolan. This policy has raised concerns about privacy and the ethical implications of surveillance in public spaces, as well as the potential for misuse of such technology. Critics argue that it undermines the experience of attending live events and highlights broader issues regarding how venues manage dissent and customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If they pulled Miller out of the line and only then checked his photo ID, and the allegation is they used facial recognition to trigger this, then that implies they already had his biometrics in their database.The legal disclaimer shown at the venue implies that the biometrics are collected (and “retained, stored, and converted”) at the venue.  That’s clearly only half of the story.  They must also be collecting (and retaining, storing, and converting) information about anyone using sources outside the venue.The implication from chronology of the story is that MSG must have done something like googled Miller, found his LinkedIn bio-pic, and put that in their “safety and security” database?I think we can conclude therefore that the disclaimer sign is not a quasi-legal disclaimer to let the venue record your face, but in fact a canard to divert your attention from the fact that they have already created records linking your face to your name — records created without your consent and without letting you know they did it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Frank Miller Jr. made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature,” Mikyl Cordova, executive vice president of communications and marketing for the company, said in an emailed statement.If he made threats, what were the threats?If he didn't make threats, does this written statement, from a communications executive, to a journalist, intended for news publication, constitute libel?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His behavior was disrespectful and disruptive and in violation of our code of conduct.Certainly not the first time a vague and imposing "code of conduct" has caused trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43511340</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of a new law in the UK that allows police to stop and search individuals without reasonable suspicion in certain areas. This measure is aimed at addressing rising violent crime rates and is controversial due to concerns about potential racial profiling and the erosion of civil liberties. Supporters argue that it will help reduce crime and keep communities safe, while critics warn it may disproportionately affect minority groups and lead to mistrust in police. The debate continues as various stakeholders weigh the effectiveness and implications of this law on public safety and community relations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article does not make it clear why they think the portrait depicts Shakespeare. I guess you have to watch the tv show for that information?It talks about comparison to other portraits of Shakespeare, but as far as I know there are no depictions of Shakespeare confirmed to have been made in his lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never been a fan of classic portraits of people, but by way of watching a lot of Baumgartner restoration videos it's become an interest.A lot apparently goes into establishing the authenticity of portraits. As a conservator, he does a lot of work in the background that isn't always conveyed in the videos.Sometimes the outcome of his restoration efforts is to communicate to the client that the painting is either a copy, or may have history but the subject isn't who they thought it was.No actual comment on this particular story, but the little bit I've learned of the art community is that they put a huge amount of effort into confirming provenance. The history of the painting.So if a lot of experts in the field are raising doubts, it's probably worth examining their statements.Like archaeologists, most want to make a major find. It's career making. But that also requires being highly sceptical of new claims.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a starting place to help in determining any and all of these sorts of paintings, would be a complete catelog of evererything in existence related including tools, note books,church records,genetic evidence,clothing,
all of it.
And have at it, a grand and worthy quest, and as has happened many times, the tinyest details can make or break a theory, and it is the fleshing out of those minutia that brings the past back to life, and that imediatecy is what facinates people 
 And to think of the lovely absurdity of this bloke, growing up, with the bard,himeself, looming
just there by the telly.,.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43478480</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing awareness regarding app usage privacy and data tracking. It highlights how companies monitor user interactions with apps and devices, leading to concerns about personal privacy. The piece emphasizes the need for greater transparency and user control over their data, suggesting that users should be more informed about app permissions and the implications of their choices. Ultimately, it calls for a shift in the tech industry to prioritize user privacy over profit.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ACTION_MAIN loophole has been written about before: https://commonsware.com/blog/2020/04/05/android-r-package-vi...Google refuses to patch this. I wonder what would happen if you submit it to the Android VDP as a permission bypass.There’s also this SO question by the author about the bypass: https://stackoverflow.com/q/79527331&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still, will never understand the need for native "Apps". To this day, I have never seen an "App" that couldn't simply have been a website/webapp. Most of them would likely be improved by being a webapp.The only benefits I can see of "Apps", are the developer get's access to private information they really don't need.Yeah, they get to be on the "App Store". But the "App Store" is a totally unnecessary concept introduced by Apple/Google so they could scrape a huge percentage in sales.Web browsers have good (not perfect) sandboxing, costs no fees to "submit" and are accessible to everyone on every phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's why I like hacker news.I found this article yesterday and posted it on reddit android, here : https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1jmwg4w/everyone_k...0 upvote, comment filled with what is either depressed sad people or just bots.Here it's top 2...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and highlights the challenges and opportunities within the industry as governments and consumers shift towards cleaner transportation options. It examines the advancements in battery technology, the impact of charging infrastructure, and the importance of policy support in accelerating EV adoption. The article also addresses concerns about sustainability, particularly regarding the sourcing of materials for batteries, and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to mitigate environmental impacts while promoting the transition to electric mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I initially dismissed it as the same category of stupid as anti-vax beliefs, but it turns out that there are a decent amount of good studies showing a link between fluoride in water and (slightly) lower IQ when pregnant mothers ingest the fluoride. Note that there is no significant effect after birth.The idea is to remove fluoride from water and advise pregnant women to use fluoride-free toothpaste.Everyone else can get enough fluoride from modern toothpastes, or regular dentist treatments.The logic is that fluoride in tap water made sense in the era before toothpaste had it, but now it is “overmedicating” a vulnerable fraction of the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s going to go poorly. A Canadian city removed fluoride from water in 2011 and reversed that decision 10 years later. There’s hard data on the effects and they’re not good [0].[0] https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5224138/calgary-removed...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is trivial today to get whatever level of fluoride is recommended for dental health, via toothpaste.  So there is no compelling need to fluoridate as there exist viable alternatives to achieve the same  that fluoridation is for any other purpose than dental health.In the USA, dental care is not covered by public insurance, and is an optional add-on to insurance through one’s employer.So without addressing at all whether fluoridation is effective or safe, there doesn’t seem to be any compelling need to fluoridate public water, and there’s no economic down side for the public if governments choose not to do so.Given this, why not just leave people alone to make their own choices?  If the citizens in a city or state want to fluoridate the public water supply, then do so; if they choose not to, then leave them alone.  It’s a free country and voters are grownups; let them choose for themselves.If you live in a place that chooses the choice you dislike but for some reason fluoridated public water supply is a critical issue for you, either campaign to change it or vote with your feet.This issue just doesn’t seem important enough to me to spend any effort arguing either way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517833</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the troubling case of a computer scientist who became uncontactable following an FBI raid and subsequent removal of references to their work from a university website. The situation raises questions about academic freedom, the rights of researchers, and the implications of federal investigations on academic careers. It highlights concerns regarding transparency and the potential chilling effects on research in sensitive areas due to law enforcement actions. The scientist's silence and the lack of official information contribute to growing speculation and concern within the academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue95 is a graphical user interface designed to mimic the look and feel of Windows 95, created for modern operating systems. The project is open-source and allows users to enjoy a retro computing experience with familiar icons, sounds, and layouts from the classic Windows operating system. It serves as a nostalgic tool for enthusiasts who appreciate vintage computing culture, and provides installation instructions and customization options for users interested in exploring this unique interface.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks nice and easy to use.My hypothesis is today's "modern" OS user interfaces are objectively worse from a usability perspective, obfuscating key functionality behind layers of confusing menus.It reminds me of these "OS popularity since the 70s" time lapse views:https://youtube.com/watch?v=cTKhqtll5cQThe dominance of Windows is crazy, even today, Mac desktops and laptops are comparatively niche&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's just the chicago theme I'va had for years now on my XFCE, I think it's a bit lame to steal that theme (not from Microsoft but the maker of that xfce theme), put it in a repository, give it a different name, and pose it as your own work?The repo literally adds nothing, just a name change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lately I've been strongly considering helping migrate my parents to Linux. Their needs are primarily web-based with some basic productivity tools mixed in, and Windows has just been getting more and more hostile. On top of this, they're at an age where they're now more susceptible than ever to various scams/attacks, and shutting down an entire category of problems by removing Windows from the picture is increasingly attractive.I had forgotten that Chicago95 exists, but this might be exactly the right thing. They'd immediately find it familiar, and while the theme isn't the whole story, this would go a long way in easing the transition I think.I miss this era of computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43524937</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to create self-contained Python scripts using the `uvicorn` server, highlighting the benefits of deploying lightweight, executable scripts that do not require a full server setup. It provides step-by-step instructions for packaging a Python application with its dependencies, using tools like `pyinstaller` to compile the script into a standalone executable. The post emphasizes the advantages of portability and ease of distribution for development and deployment, making it easier for users to run Python applications without needing to install Python or additional libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has come up a LOT on HN in the past few months, some other recent examples:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43500124https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42463975I like uv and all, but I take exception to the "self-contained" claim in two regards:1) The script requires uv to already be installed. Arguably you could make it a shell script that checks if uv is already installed and then installs it via curlpipe if not... but that's quite a bit of extra boilerplate and the curlpipe pattern is already pretty gross on its own.2) Auto-creating a venv somewhere in your home directory is not really self-contained. If you run the script as a one-off and then delete it, that venv is still there, taking up space. I can't find any assertion in the uv docs that these temporary virtual environments are ever automatically cleaned up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My pet peeve (in general, not specific to UV, which I genuinely appreciate) is using comment sections for controlling code execution.Using comments for linters and developer notes is perfectly acceptable. However, for configuration or execution-related data, a far superior pattern would be something like:  UV_ENV = {
    "dependencies": { "requests":  "2.32.3", "pandas": "2.2.3" }
  }


This approach has clear advantages:- It's valid Python syntax.- It utilizes standard, easily-parsable data structures rather than ad-hoc comment parsing. It makes creation and validation smooth.- Crucially, it adheres to a core principle: if you remove all comments from your code, it should still execute identically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do the same with Nix, the shebang line looks like this:    #! nix-shell -i python3 -p "python312.withPackages (pkgs: [ pkgs.boto3 pkgs.click ])"

With this, the only requirement is Nix on the system, you don't even need Python to be installed!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519669</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "upcast," which refers to a method of referring to a type that is more general or a parent class in programming. It highlights the importance of being able to use upcasting effectively within object-oriented programming languages to facilitate polymorphism and code reusability. The author outlines practical examples and scenarios that illustrate the benefits and applications of upcasting in software development, ultimately emphasizing how it can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Even though DebugAny inherits from AnyI'm going to push back against this terminology for the sake of people who don't know Rust and are coming from traditional OO languages.Rust traits don't "inherit" from other traits, they "require" other traits.So if I have two traits, where one requires the other:    trait Foo {}

    trait Bar: Foo {}

That doesn't add Foo's methods to Bar's list of methods, like you might expect from the term "inheritance".Instead, it just means that it's not possible to implement Bar for a type unless Foo is also separately implemented for that type.Despite this it's still accurate to say that this enables a supertype/subtype relationship in certain contexts, but be careful because Rust isn't a traditionally OO language, so that may not always be the most useful framing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The important change here appears to be that the internal representation of a vtable is now guaranteed to have its supertraits laid out in some predictable prefix form to its own methods.EDIT: or if this is not possible, a pointer to the appropriate vtable is included. I assume this must be for diamond trait inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This example shows how it works for one trait, Debug, but what if you have a type that (might) implement multiple traits A, B, and/or C?  It isn't clear to me if that is possible,  unless the type implements all of those traits.  What I'd like to do is have some base trait object and query it to see if it supports other interfaces, but also not have to have stub "I don't actually implement this" trait impls for the unsupported ones.  A bit like how I might use dynamic_cast in c++.(I believe I understand that in rust this has not historically been possible because rust doesn't have inheritance, so, there can be only one vtable for a type, rather than an chain like you might have in c++.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523238</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't help but thinking how handy PowerShell is out of the box for tasks like this.Translating the examples from the ReadMe, having read the file with:  $medias = Get-Content .\medias.csv | ConvertFrom-Csv

Previewing the file in the terminal  xan view medias.csv
  $medias | Format-Table

Reading a flattened representation of the first row  xan flatten -c medias.csv
  $medias | Format-List

Searching for rows  xan search -s outreach internationale medias.csv | xan view
  $medias | Where-Object { $_.outreach -eq "internationale" } | Format-Table

Selecting some columns  xan select foundation_year,name medias.csv | xan view
  $medias | Select-Object -Property foundation_year, name | Format-Table

Sorting the file  xan sort -s foundation_year medias.csv | xan view -s name,foundation_year
  $medias | Sort-Object -Property foundation_year | Select-Object -Property name, foundation_year | Format-Table

Deduplicating the file on some column  # Some medias of our corpus have the same ids on mediacloud.org
  xan dedup -s mediacloud_ids medias.csv | xan count &amp;&amp; xan count medias.csv
  $medias | Select-Object -ExpandProperty mediacloud_ids -Unique | Measure-Object; $medias | Measure-Object -Property mediacloud_ids

Computing frequency tables  xan frequency -s edito medias.csv | xan view
  $medias | Group-Object -Property edito | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending

It's probably orders of magnitude slower, and of course, plotting graphs and so on gets tricky. But for the simple type of analysis I typically do, it's fast enough, I don't need to learn an extra tool, and the auto-completion of column/property names is very convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer to use clickhouse-local for all my CSV needs as I don't need to learn a new language (or cli flags) and can just leverage SQL.    clickhouse local --file medias.csv --query "SELECT edito, count() AS count from table group by all order by count FORMAT PrettyCompact"

The Software Counters mode rr wiki has more details in case you're curious about some more of the internals.You should move that to the top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have tried SO hard to get rr to work for me, including buying a separate pc just to use it...but it just consistently fails so I've basically abandoned it. Something like this would absolutely be a godsend. Just getting something consistently working with Ubuntu is amazing. Does this approach make working in something like WSL viable?I would love if this were upstreamed. Is there a github issue where you discuss the possibility of this with the rr devs? That might be something to add to your readme for everyone else who wants to follow along. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. It’s difficult to praise rr too much, and it just keeps getting better. If you’re not using it, you’re missing out on a superpower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43481652</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the characteristics and challenges faced by the average college student today, examining aspects such as mental health issues, financial burdens, and the impact of technology on learning and social interactions. It highlights that many students experience stress and anxiety due to academic pressures, rising tuition costs, and the need for effective time management. Additionally, the piece reflects on how the educational landscape has evolved, particularly through the integration of online learning and the importance of peer relationships, while emphasizing the need for supportive structures to help students navigate these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of talk about how LLMs will disrupt software development and office work and whatnot, but there is one thing that they are massively disrupting right now, and that is education. I've witnessed this with a group of CS master students recently, and they have let their programming skills atrophy to barely imaginable levels. LLMs have the twin effect of raising the bar for what even a barely viable junior developer has to live up to, while simultaneously lowering their actual skills. There is a generation of completely unemployable "graduates" in the pipeline.The article mentions that most students are only in it for the diploma anyway, but somehow most people are yet to realize that those diplomas will soon be toilet paper, precisely because they no longer require any actual effort to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can bear with me while i attempt a synthesis here, I think this one line captures basically the entire dynamic, but the author seems to seriously underweight its explanatory value.&gt; The average student has seen college as basically transactional for as long as I’ve been doing thisIt is a transaction. The number of students there because they want to learn a subject rounds to zero. A college degree (especially from good old State U) serves first and foremost as a white-collar job permit. The students (or their parents/lender/state) are purchasing the permit from the institution. They are the customer. Anything you, the employee, ask of them beyond the minimum to hold up the fig leaf is a waste of the students' time (from their perspective) and a violation of the implied terms of this transaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What has changed exactly? Chronic absenteeism. As a friend in Sociology put it, “Attendance is a HUGE problem—many just treat class as optional.” Last semester across all sections, my average student missed two weeks of class.My brother and I graduated from university a little over 4 years ago and we were both top students (he studied music and I studied applied math). There were classes where he and I (without exaggeration) skipped more than 90% of the lectures.I understand that some professors view this as disrepsectful, but when your lectures consist of simply reading off the lecture notes that you're going to upload online anyway, lectures become a waste of time that could be better spent with more studying on our own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43522966</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The document consists of four lectures given by Mads Tofte that focus on programming language semantics, particularly the formal underpinnings of functional programming. It covers key concepts such as type systems, evaluation strategies, and the relationship between programming languages and mathematical logic. Tofte discusses various semantic models, including operational and denotational semantics, providing insights and examples about how these models can be applied to understand and reason about programming languages. The overall aim is to deepen comprehension of how formal semantics can enhance programming language design and improve software reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

It's old, has its warts, but is still vastly superior to most things that came later. (Type inference? check! Pattern matching? check! TCO? check!. Performance ? excellent!, ...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI for everyone: This is not about Machine Learning. It is about a programming language called Standard ML where ML stands for Meta Language[1].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite bit of SML trivia: the infix function composition operator is “o” — lowercase letter o — so you can write ‘(f o g)(x)’ just like mathematical notation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43522363</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses tail call recursion in Java using the ASM library to optimize recursion by reusing the current stack frame for certain calls, thus avoiding stack overflow errors associated with deep recursion. It explains the concept of tail calls, the limitations of Java's default stack behavior, and provides examples of implementing tail call optimization with ASM, showcasing how this technique can improve performance in recursive algorithms. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding both recursion and the underlying mechanisms of the Java runtime for effective programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's been a long time since I've messed with Java bytecode [1], but shouldn't the private method call use INVOKESPECIAL?In general I don't think you can do this to INVOKEVIRTUAL (or INVOKEINTERFACE) as it covers cases where your target is not statically resolved (virtual/interface calls). This transformation should be limited to INVOKESTATIC and INVOKESPECIAL.You also need lots more checks to make sure you can apply the transformations, like ensure the call site is not covered by try block.1: https://jauvm.blogspot.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the "lambda the ultimate" papers and the birth of scheme was a loong time ago, so it grates on my ears to hear this topic presented as "an optimization". Yes, it is sometimes an optimization a compiler can make, but the idea is much better presented as a useful semantic of a language.in the same way that passing parameters to a subfunction "creates" a special set of local variables for the subfunction, the tail recursion semantic updates this set of local variables in an especially clean way for loop semantics, allowing "simultaneous assignment" from old values to new ones.(yes, it would be confusing with side effected C/C++ operators like ++ because then you'd need to know order of evaluation or know not to do that, but those are already issues in those languages quite apart from tail recursion)because it's the way I learned it, I tend to call the semantic "tail recursion" and the optimization "tail call elimination", but since other people don't do the same it's somewhat pointless; but I do like to crusade for awareness of the semantic beyond the optimization. If it's an optimization, you can't rely on it because you could blow the stack on large loops. If it's a semantic, you can rely on it.(the semantic is not entirely "clean" either. it's a bit of a subtle point that you need to return straightaway the return value of the tail call or it's not a tail call. fibonacci is the sum of the current with the next so it's not a tail call unless you somewhat carefully arrange the values you pass/keep around. also worth pointing out that all "tail calls" are up for consideration, not just recursive ones)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every compiler should recognize and optimize for tail recursion. It's not any harder than most other optimizations, and some algorithms are far better expressed recursively.Why is this not done?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523741</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Towards Fearless SIMD" discusses advancements and best practices in the use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) programming to enhance performance in software development. It emphasizes overcoming common challenges associated with SIMD, such as code complexity and debugging difficulties, and advocates for strategies that enhance programmer productivity and confidence. The author shares insights into effective coding techniques, tools, and frameworks that can aid developers in leveraging SIMD more effectively while ensuring maintainability and reducing errors in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Rust feels like a Python developer’s idea of a high-performance computing language. It’s a great language for many kinds of applications — just not when you need to squeeze out every bit of performance from advanced hardware.Even before getting into SIMD, try using Rust for concurrent, succinct, or external-memory data structures. It quickly becomes clear where the friction is.Cargo is fantastic — clean, ergonomic, and a joy compared to many toolchains. But it’s much easier to keep things simple when you don’t have to support dozens of AVX-512 variants, AMX, SME, different CUDA generations, ROCm, or any of the other modern hardware capabilities.Standardising SIMD in the standard library — in Rust or C++ — has always been a questionable idea. Most of these APIs cater to operations that compilers already auto-vectorize reasonably well, and they barely touch the recent capabilities of SIMD. Just consider how hard it is to build any meaningful abstraction over the predicate/register models across AVX-512, SVE, and RVV.RVV aside, this should illustrate the point: https://www.modular.com/blog/understanding-simd-infinite-com...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems rustc nightly does successfully vectorize the first sigmoid example: https://rust.godbolt.org/z/e1WYexqWYAlso there's progress on making safe intrinsics safe: https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/pull/1714&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting! I posted a vector and quaternion lib here a few weeks ago, and got great feedback on the state of SIMD on these things. I since have went on a deep dive, and implemented wrapper types in a similar way to this library. Used macros to keep repetition down. Split into three main sections:  - Floating point primitives. Like this lib. Basically, copied `core::simd`'s API. Will delete this part once core::simd is stable. `f32x8`, `f64x4` types etc, with standard operator overloads, and utility methods like `splat`, `to_array` etc.

  - Vec and Quaternion analogs. Same idea, similar API. Vec3x8, Quaternionx8 etc.

  - Code to convert slices of floating point values, or non-SIMD vectors and quaternions to SIMD ones, including (partial) handling of accessing valid lanes in the last chunk.

I've incorporated these `x8` types into a WIP molecular dynamics application; relatively painless after setting up the infra. Would love to try `Vec3x16` etc, but 512-bit types aren't stable yet. But from Github activity on Rust, it sounds like this is right around the corner!Of note, as others pointed out in the thread here I mentioned, the other vector etc libs are using the AoS approach, where a single f32x4 value etc is used to represent a Vec3 etc. While with this SoA approach, a `Vec3x8` is for performing operations on 8 Vec3s at once.The article had interesting and surprising points on AVX-512 (Needed for f32x16, Vec3x16 etc). Not sure of the implications of exposing this in a public library is, i.e. might be a trap if the user isn't on one of the AMD Zen CPUs mentioned.From a few examples, I seem to get 2-4x speedup from using the x8 intrinsics, over scalar (non-SIMD) operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519823</guid></item><item><title>13.

Cell level simulation is the current bottleneck of the project, why would we not start at the cellular level, and then move up to multicellular organisms? Of course this ultimately leads to the question, can we truly simulate anything if we can’t simulate at the quantum level?(at scale) It would be quite profound to find out that we can fully simulate complex life while abstracting the lower levels, if that were the case, maybe we don’t need them either!

I also built MCP servers for Mysql, Twilio, Polars, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is wild. Our company has like 10 data scientists writing SQL queries on our DB for business questions. I can deploy pg-mcp for my organization so everyone can use Claude to answer whatever is on their mind?

I don't even remember who it was, but to this day feel bad about that.When I got home, my parents said it's no problem, just write a letter explaining what happened and the tooth fairy will understand.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here!I started writing this review in 2022, after learning about The Nobel Duel at the Frontiers in Reproduction course (Prof. Stephen Hammes mentioned it to me). At the time, both Schally and Guillemin were still alive! I worked on the review off and on for nearly 3 years. It’s a rather complex story, and I went down a lot of scientific rabbit holes in the process (such as looking into 1960s peptide purification methods).Overall, I think the main lesson I learned is that the rivalry between Schally and Guillemin was avoidable. In other words, their “winner takes all” scientific environment was a necessary component of the rivalry, but by itself it wasn’t sufficient. After all, plenty of other endocrinologists didn’t have massive feuds. The rivalry was really driven by the combination of the scientific environment with the personalities and communication styles of the two men. If Schally and Guillemin had had a candid conversation in 1961 and agreed to work in separate areas (or, less likely, to work as equal partners), the whole feud would have never happened.So today, if you’re feeling like someone isn’t giving you credit for your work, or is being unfair to you, reach out and talk to them before things escalate too far. Of course, this may not work, but it’s better than sending nasty letters (or these days, emails or tweets) back and forth. There will always be competition in science, but duels can be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526396</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the book "Introduction to System Programming for Linux," which serves as a comprehensive guide for those looking to learn system programming using Linux. It covers fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques, including programming in C, using system calls, and understanding file systems and processes. The book aims to equip readers with the skills to write efficient and effective system-level applications on Linux, making it suitable for students, hobbyists, and professionals interested in deepening their understanding of operating systems and low-level programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, this might be perfect for me depending on how the book is written/who the target audience is. $60 for an ebook or $80 for the hard copy is extremely hard to swallow though. I absolutely think a book of that purported length means an author probably put a lot of effort and time into it, and should get compensated. But I'm not familiar with the author at all so you're really buying sight unseen. Has he written anything else? I couldn't find anything with a quick google search.Tangentially related, I was hoping to skim at least the first chapter via the Safari Books Online subscription which afaik had all of the No-Starch books on there (including early access I thought?). But no luck, maybe it'll be added there closer to publication date.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might buy it, but the content already seems to overlap with APUE and/or the Linux Programming Interface&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would be interested in any impressions of this vs. TLPI. Seems like it covers a lot of similar topics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526763</guid></item><item><title>19.

https://foxev.io/ev-mastermind-kit/Backstory: from 2018-2023 I converted London taxis to be electric and built three prototypes. We also raised £300k. I have a day-job again these days and am persisting what I learnt and sharing it. YouTube is super interesting for me because of the writing, similar for the web app actually because the code isn't that complicated, it's about how do I present it in a way that engaged users, so I am thinking mostly about UX.Actually why not, here is the intro to the first module (100 questions about batteries - ends in a 404):

Publish posts by sending an email (or use the Pagecord app). Your readers can follow you by RSS, or subscribe to your posts by email.Share long-form posts or short stream-of-consciousness thoughts. Both look great!Pagecord is independent, open source and built to last :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m working on https://pikku.devIt’s a TypeScript web framework that’s runtime agnostic, so it can work on serverless and servers (similar to Hono).What’s different is that the focus is primarily just on TypeScript. There’s a CLI tool that inspects all the project code and generates loads of metadata. This can include:• services used• all the HTTP routes, inputs and outputs• OpenAPI documentation• schemas to validate against• typed fetch client• typed WebSocket client
(and more)The design decision was also to make it follow a function-based approach, which means your product code is just functions (that get given all the services required). And you have controllers that wire them up to different transport protocols.This allows interesting design concepts, like writing WebSocket code via serverless format, while allowing it to be deployed via a single process or distributed/serverless. Or progressive enhancement, allowing backend functions to work as HTTP, but also work via Server-Sent Events if a stream is provided.It also allows functions to be called directly from Next.js and full-stack development frameworks without needing to run on a separate server or use their API endpoints (not a huge advocate, but it helps a lot with SSR). Gave a talk about that last week at the Node.js meetup in Berlin.It’s still not 1.0 and there are breaking changes while I include more use cases.Upcoming changes:• use Request and Response objects to make it truly runtime agnostic (currently each adapter has its own thin layer, which tbf is still needed by many that don’t adopt the web spec)• smarter code splitting (this will reduce bundle size by tree-shaking anything not needed on a per-function basis)• queues (one more form of transport)Check it out, would love feedback!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43527452</guid></item><item><title>20.

I wasn't special. They were common. But it's only in the last few years that I've been hearing any concern about the batteries in consumer electronic devices causing aircraft fires.I remember hearing about the ones in hoverboards, and then there was one version of a Samsung device that had problems, but nobody generalized to "all such electronic items must be in the cabin with you, and if you lose track of yours, we're turning the plane around."Did something maybe change about battery chemistry that I don't know about? Or did the design change, such that the batteries aren't protected anymore or have enough more capacity that they've become dangerous?I can't imagine there were actually widespread battery fires for as long as I remember never having heard not to put a battery in checked luggage, so what else changed such that this is such a major issue now when it wasn't before?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a sense of scale, the FAA has been tracking battery related incidents, and you can take a looksie here: https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/resources/lithium_batteries/incid...You can click through to see specific incident summaries. It looks like a significant amount (if not majority) of events are inflight on passenger flights (as opposed to on the ground, tarmac, ground handling, or freight operations). There were 85 total incidents in 2024 (there were some 9 million passenger revenue departures to give another sense of scale).Lost phone is a problem because:* Could be in a place that increases risk of thermal run away to begin with - classic example would be caught in the seat hinge. But even being stuck surrounding by cushioning could increase the risk of overheating* Decreased visibility. The faster you can react (ie, try to dump the thing into a thermal protection bag / get it away from other flammables) the better. If you read the incidents, you'll see time after time the sequence "passenger notified flight attendant, who then placed it in a thermal containment bag, flight completed normally".I could see changes to rules that will begin to prohibit storing batteries in overhead compartments (which aside from the pinch problem, actually has all the same risks of losing a phone). Or perhaps mandatory/routine pre-emptive use of thermal containment bags.The airliners know there's no going back. They must accommodate for batteries, so they'll seek the right balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523765</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an optimization technique for memory comparison in programming, specifically focusing on achieving faster performance than the traditional `memcmp` function. It presents a detailed analysis of various algorithms and methods to improve memory comparison speed, considering factors such as CPU architecture and data alignment. The author shares benchmarks and results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, ultimately aiming to provide developers with insights to enhance their code efficiency when dealing with memory operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more meaningful adventure into microbenchmarking than my last. I look at why we no longer need to P/Invoke memcmp to efficiently compare arrays in C# / .NET.Old stackoverflow answers are a dangerous form of bit-rot. They get picked up by well-meaning developers and LLMs alike and recreated years after they are out of date.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The call to "memcmp" has overhead.  It's an imported function which cannot be inlined, and the marshaller will automatically create pinned GC handles to the memory inside of the arrays as they are passed to the native code.I wonder how it would compare if you passed actual pointers to "memcmp" instead of marshalled arrays.  You'd use "fixed (byte *p = bytes) {" on each array first so that the pinning happens outside of the function call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That's not a super helpful description, but the summary is that it's stack-allocated rather than heap allocated.I’m pretty sure that this is not 100% correct, since one can also use other allocation methods and use a span to represent it. Only with stackalloc will the memory it points to be stackallocated.
What it basically means is that the type is stack allocated, always, but not the memory it points to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43524665</guid></item><item><title>24. 6502 as a Service</title><link>https://www.emulationonline.com/systems/chiplab/6502-lab-available/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the release of 6502 Lab, a comprehensive online emulator for the 6502 microprocessor, which is ideal for both beginners and experienced programmers interested in 8-bit computing. It offers features such as a user-friendly interface, real-time debugging, and a variety of built-in examples to facilitate learning and experimentation with assembly language programming. The site provides access to detailed resources, tutorials, and a community forum for support, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to explore the capabilities of the 6502 chip.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the page:"Why do this?Through these reads and writes, we can get glimpses into the internal operation of the chip. Now for the 6502 this is a bit unnecessary, as the internal operations of the chip are already well known.But there are many systems for which the inner workings are not well understood. This chiplab, initially tested with the 6502, should provide a way to learn and build models for these less well understood chips."So, this is pretty much useless at its current state, a placeholder for introspecting more advanced, less known chips in the future. It's pretty much a "because we can" kind of system. And that's a darn fine excuse for building this.Awesome work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the chiplab devboard, it's actually a 65c02. There is a difference.  A lot of differences, actually.https://emulationonline.com/shop/chiplab_6502/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively it's fairly trivial today to run a transistor-level simulation of the 6502 (and a couple of other chips) thanks to the visual6502 reverse engineering effort (the http: link is intended):http://visual6502.org/The netlist is available in their Git repo:https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502...and there's a C port of the netlist simulation code:https://github.com/mist64/perfect6502One advantage of this approach is that you can inspect internal chip state that isn't visible on the output pins, which is very useful for emulator coding....and a couple of years ago I glued all those bits and pieces together for a 'remix' of the original visual6502 web application, using WASM + WebGL + Dear Imgui:https://floooh.github.io/visual6502remix/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520428</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I seem to recall that Vizio was added to my "do not buy" list quite a long time ago, when it turned out they were monitoring your watching habit (https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/7/14527360/vizio-smart-tv-tr...).This seems to be more of the same I guess. Choice text from the link above:Q: Why did I see an ad in Scenic Mode?A: After Scenic Mode launches to full screen, you may see ads. We offer free, scenic content by supporting it with ads. These ads allow VIZIO to offer enhanced, built-in Smart TV features, 300+ live channels, and 15,000+ movies and shows at no cost through WatchFree+ while also helping keep the price of our TVs accessible and competitive.Q: Can I turn Scenic Mode ads off?A: No, not at this time. These ads allow VIZIO to offer enhanced, built-in Smart TV features, 300+ live channels, and 15,000+ movies and shows at no cost through WatchFree+ while also helping keep the price of our TVs accessible and competitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And possibly why this got posted:https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/1jkwcbx/if...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a "smart" TV you'd like to avoid connecting to the internet for reasons like this, you can try disconnecting the wireless module entirely. I had a Sony Bravia TV I didn't trust, and after popping off the back I disconnected the wireless module's ribbon cable. The android-TV OS handled it gracefully, and now I don't have to worry about it attempting to smuggle data through any other WLANs in my apartment building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520074</guid></item><item><title>26.

I havent done the full analysis yet but it‘s already clear that how I think I spend my time is completely different from how I actually spend it.Perception/„feeling“ vs physical reality. The gap is huge.Trivial example, I was convinced that the „time toll“ i have to pay around training was very high. Like I was spending an hour or more just to change into sportswear, shower afterwards, and switch back. This perceived deadweight loss always presented an additional  psychological hurdle to get off my ass and train. Now that I know that it‘s much less than I thought, it‘s gone.Similar for cooking.Like I said, havent done the full analysis yet but I can already highly recommend this practice of recording time at least for a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is a disturbing length of time to spend on LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Mac Users, Qbserve is a pretty good time tracking app that observes you as you use your computer (not just the browser, although it has plugins to identify the sites you browse), and is a good way to start getting a grip on time management, even if it can be a little overwhelming at first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43482468</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Sim Daltonism is a color blindness simulator that helps users visualize how colors appear to individuals with different types of color blindness. The application allows users to adjust their display settings to experience color variations as seen by those with conditions like protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. It serves as an educational tool for designers, artists, and anyone interested in understanding color perception differences, ensuring that content is accessible to all audiences. The website provides downloadable versions for various operating systems and highlights its commitment to inclusivity in design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone on Android, this is possible with Simulate Color Space option in the hidden Developer Tools menu. Amusingly it works with the camera too, so you can look around the real world with some sense of what it's like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ll highlight a note from the developer:Sim Daltonism lets you see through the eyes of someone with a color blindness. While the colors shown are a good approximation of what a color blind person would see, you should not expect them to be perfect.Everyone has his own perception of colors that differs slightly from other people, and color blindness are often partial at different degrees. More importantly, cameras do not have the same spectral response as cones in your eyes, so the simulation has to make some assumptions about the frequency composition of the colors.I’m colorblind and haven’t found a simulator that comes close to what it’s like for me. This app doesn’t do it either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential: I've been playing around with the color blindness filters on my iPhone, and the grayscale filter had me thinking for a moment. I've set it to 50%, set up the accessibility shortcut (triple-click on the home button) to toggle it, and found myself using my phone with the filter on basically 99% of the time.It's been a couple of months, and I've noticed that the oversaturated colors were making me slightly agitated, somehow captivating my attention. I sometimes disable the filter to look at a particular picture, or to figure out a detail in some context where the colors are already desaturated. Now my only wish is that it was less linear, maybe like a compressor in audio - maintain detail until it starts approaching the ceiling.It may be a good idea if you'd consider &lt;thelightphone.com&gt; but don't want to switch.Also, Rob Pike: &lt;https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2020/09/color-blindness-i...&gt;Also: &lt;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=plan+9+from+bell+labs+rio&amp;ia=image...&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503670</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces the concepts of functors, applicatives, and monads, which are key abstractions in functional programming, particularly in Haskell. It explains the definitions and roles of each, highlighting how they can be used to manage side effects and enable a more functional programming style. The article provides examples to illustrate these concepts and shows how they relate to each other, emphasizing their importance for structuring code in a clear and predictable manner. The content is aimed at helping readers understand these concepts with a practical approach and encouraging exploration in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason everyone likes to talk about Monads, but really the other types here are just as interesting.  For example, Applicatives are less dynamic than Monads in that you can't `flatMap`/`bind` to decide on the "next" thing to evaluate based on the previous value, but in exchange you get a "static" tree (or graph) of Applicatives that lends itself much better to static analysis, optimization, parallelism, and so on.IIRC Haxl (https://github.com/facebook/Haxl) uses Applicatives to optimize and parallelise remote data fetching, which is hard to do with Monads since those are inherently sequential due to the nature of `flatMap`/`bind`. My own Mill build tool (https://mill-build.org/) uses an applicative structure for your build so we can materialize the entire build graph up front and choose how to parallelize it, query it, or otherwise manipulate it, which is again impossible with Monads since the structure of a Monad computation is only assembled "on the fly" as the individual steps are being evaluated. "Parallel Validation" where you want to aggregate all failures, rather than stopping at the first one, is another common use case (e.g. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/validation or https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/validated.html)Monads seem to have this strange aura around them that attracts certain kinds of personalities, but really they're just one abstraction in a whole toolkit of useful abstractions, and there are many cases where Applicative or some other construct are much more suited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,...I think over the recent years, there's been a rise in typed languages that support functional programming like TypeScript and Rust. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues in the context of AI assistant programming. My guess is that it will become easier for beginners, and the type systems will help to build more robust programs in cooperation with AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, while you may not have appreciated the tone of the Haskell interaction, they are correct in their assessment from a factual perspective. This explanation propagates a number of misunderstandings of the topics well known to be endemic to beginners.In particular, I observed the common belief that functors apply to "containers", when in fact they apply to things that are not containers as well, most notably functions themselves, and it also contains the common belief that a monad has "a" value, rather than any number of values. For instance, the "list monad" will confuse someone operating on this description because when the monad "takes the value out of the list", it actually does it once per value in the list. This is the common "monad as burrito" metaphor, basically, which isn't just bad, but is actually wrong.I'm not limiting it to these errors either, these are just the ones that leap out at me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504175</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious question, because I'm not sure how I feel about it... should software with a server-side component that needs to keep working be counted as "buy once"? We've seen so many cases of companies going out of business or just deciding that it's no longer worth running these services, and leaving customers with no recourse.An example from this list: LocalCan – https://buyoncesoftware.com/localcan – there's a server-side component (which is why ngrok its competitor is subscription based). If this component disappears the app ceases to function.The flip side to this is that just because an app is entirely local doesn't mean it will work as the software around it gets updated (OSes etc), so if a company decides to stop supporting it, that too is useless in a way. It's not the same because running it on the machine you had when you bought it would still work, but that's not how we use computers in practice. Perhaps this is a different case because many of these "buy once" would charge for a major update like that anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others have also expressed, a lot of the software here doesn't really live up to the what most people mean by 'one-time purchase'.Screen Studio: $9/month vs $220 "one-time purchase" with only one year of support.Sizzy browser: $12/month or $499 one-time purchase.Then you often have a one device limit - I can't be two places at once but I do have both a laptop and desktop machine.Who in their sane mind would choose these? Note that the problem with "one-year of updates" is not that you'd want free access to a newer major version of the app, but a year+ is enough time to have a new OS version make your app unusable or subject to security updates. While companies in the before times would quickly release a patch to keep their old users happy, the one-year term just ensures you'll be left hanging.This is just paying lip service to the idea of a one-time purchase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the items on this list "FridayGPT" doesn't actually do anything unless you plug in an API key from a subscription service. While I understand that technically the app itself is buy-once, it doesn't feel in the spirit of the website, or maybe should be called out on the page, as it could be quite misleading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519998</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the often rigid and overly cautious approach to breaking changes in software development, arguing that the fear surrounding these changes can hinder innovation and progress. It advocates for a more flexible mindset that embraces breaking changes as opportunities for improvement rather than as setbacks. The author emphasizes the importance of clear communication, user education, and gradual transition strategies to effectively manage breaking changes without causing unnecessary disruptions. Overall, the piece encourages a re-evaluation of how developers perceive and handle changes to their software, suggesting that a more open and adaptable attitude could lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post has clickbait vibe unfortunately and is really shallow regarding the analysis of the problem. No, it is not silly how we think about breaking changes. The idea of using some change log isn’t new and there are reasons why it’s not implemented by most build systems.The elephant in the room is changing business requirements. If the change requires the code to consume new parameter without reasonable defaults, no automatic migration would solve it reliably. Let’s say you deal with the money and you introduce currency field. The compiler of the client code cannot just assume the currency, neither it can take it from anywhere by just applying the migration. It is a manual operation to fix the broken code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this proposal ultimately introduces more complexity than it solves. By automatically inserting migrations (whether at compile time or via “migration files”), you end up with a form of hidden control flow that’s arguably worse than traditional overloading or type coercion. In normal type coercion, the transformation is explicit and visible in the language syntax, whereas these “migrations” happen magically behind the scenes.Second, database migrations are notoriously tricky for developers to manage correctly. They often require significant domain knowledge to avoid breaking assumptions further down the line. Applying that paradigm directly to compiler-managed code changes feels like it would amplify the same problems—especially in languages that rely on strong type inference. The slightest mismatch in inferred types could ripple through a large codebase in ways that are far from obvious.While it’s an interesting idea in theory, I think the “fix your old code with a macro-like script” approach just shifts maintenance costs elsewhere. We’d still be chasing edge cases, except now they’re tucked away behind code-generation layers and elaborate type transformations. It may reduce immediate breakage, but at the expense of clarity and predictable behavior in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way you handle breaking changes in SQL is views, not migrations; the latter is only appropriate single applications abusing SQL as a data store[0].In code, if you want to handle a breaking change transparently, you don't need the moral equivalent of a linker fix-up table. You need to keep the old definition around and redirect it to the new function. This can be as simple as having, say, the old version of your code wrap something in a list or closure and then call the new version. In languages with overloading, this can be done transparently; in others you'd have to give the new function a new name. Maybe API versioned symbols and a syntax for them is what you would want?[0] The original idea with SQL is that multiple applications would store data in the same place in a common format you could meaningfully interchange.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43497506</guid></item><item><title>38.

&gt;They cannot run in the house or jump off of furniture or towers they build,This sounds great.The issue is, to what length will you go to prevent these things.I feel like parents who have all these rules just got wildly different children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43527019</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloud has always been more expensive. I remember being quoted 250k/month for bandwidth when I was paying 15k with rackspace 10+ years ago. You’re paying for convenience and speed. The Math stops working when you grow to a certain point.You can mitigate this to some extent by making some key architecture + vendor decisions upfront when first building… or just consider that some day you’ll need to do things like this. It’s not a novel problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago (10+) when I was deciding to use aws or hosting our own hardware in a colo for my company I found a spreadsheet where you plug in your hardware and hosting costs and the current Amazon pricing for their various products and it would give you how long to break-even on the initial investment.It was always just above three years to break even. After we decided to self-host I still kept tracking the prices in the spreadsheet and as hardware costs fluctuated Amazon adjusted their prices to match. I figured someone at Amazon must have had the same spreadsheet I was working with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; $1.5 million/yearThat is excessive and it's already $4K a day.Lots of teams really underestimate cloud costs since there is an assumption that the hundreds of millions they are raising will give them enough runway to survive a few years despite losing money for years.Even scaling would be somewhat of an issue depending on the tech stack. Imagine the cost of running standard Java micro-services and the "solution" was to "spin up hundreds of more nodes". The worst that I have seen was a bank proudly having up to 8,000 - 10,000 separate micro-services.Just imagine the daily cost of that. Unjustifiable.But of course the AWS cloud consultants would be happy to shill you their offerings at "cheap" prices, but in reality the pricing is designed for you to accumulate millions in costs as you scale on the tiniest amount of usage, even for testing.So before you build the software, one must think about the costs of scaling if it becomes widely used rather than taking the easy approach in just spinning up nodes and increasing more costs and act as if you don't have the capital to solve the problem. You can only do that for so long until you don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489698</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a summer intern at IBM Kinston NY, where the PC hardware was being developed.  I remember being told by one of the engineers that IBM had decided to use standard components for the PC, except for the keyboard.The original keyboard was so bad (he said) it was also replaced, I think in 1981 or 1982.  Apparently the group in charge had internal disagreements leading to a compromise design.(I have no proof of this and my memory is going,  so any corroboration or rebuttal would be welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; IBM announces the 3161 and 3163 ASCII Display Stations, serial-based terminals in the IBM 3101 lineage that were capable of emulating various third-party terminals. They sported the first terminal-specific IBM Enhanced Keyboards, which typically have an extra key over ANSI and ISO PC-style Enhanced Keyboards, and ASCII-style ones like 316X's often uniquely have line drawing symbols on their numeric keypads.And of course you'll be playing rogue.https://sharktastica.co.uk/resources/images/terminals/Wyatt8...(Nethack came out two years later)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keyboarding was taught in my middle school using Selectrics and my high school was equipped with Model Ms on Model 50s (oh, IBM).Those two sublime instruments of typing superiority made it so that when I type I type so quickly that people have thought I was pantomiming on several occasions.As far as I'm concerned IBM solved the text input problem over a half century ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520297</guid></item><item><title>45.

If not, that's mind blowing.The header only fad seems to because of a lack of one? IIRC they're more costly compilation wise too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently discovered the usefulness of msgpack with a fixed scheme. Wrote a library for encoding/decoding msgpack based on structs. Like protobuf, it's compact and possible to evolve, plus I actually find it easier to deal with, since it decodes to native types, not protobuf wrappers. And you can read it in basically any language, which makes is super easy to debugging binary files/streams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nlohmann::json also does msgpack and is header-only, and it's the most popular JSON lib for C++ https://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=readme-ov-file#design-g...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519930</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lovable definitely seems to have a bit of a secret sauce.I've been trying to figure out how they do it.  First, Claude3.7 is probably their backend model.  Gemini 2.5 Pro is definitely getting there but I'm pretty sure Claude is still king for this kind of work.  Second, if you break up the design and then implementation, you get significantly better responses.   Finally, you have throw in a bit of what I'm calling stable-diffusion-prompt-isms where you almost excessively drop references to known brands or design philosophies to trigger those 'latent' memories and steer away from the more-basic stuff that seems to otherwise surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roo-Code with Claude Sonnet 3.7 as the backend has worked near perfect for me for small websites.If you point it to a site to clone with instructions on what to change, you get very good results in half an hour's work and &lt;5$ spent.Pretty stiff competition for the bottom end of the web creation/maitainance market for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor has gone to the next level with Gemini 2.5. The reasons it gives for what it’s doing are well thought through and far more in context.Gemini seems to now advise you when you’re telling it to do something that may not make sense - first time I’ve really seen a non-Yes Man LLM. It’s more like a Yes-but-are-you-sure man.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43484944</guid></item><item><title>47.

Brightness / Contrast in "image editor of choice (or financial availability)""Dust", especially, tends to severely darken the image on every setting other than "screen".Generally, cool that it's done totally in browser, and better than what's available on a lot of phone apps.Photoshop's "texturizer" from decades ago would be something else to possible look at.  Making a quick "canvas" look to the image, and similar "noise".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43491245</guid></item><item><title>48. “Moonshots” Initiative to Secure the Future of RISC OS</title><link>https://www.riscosopen.org/news/articles/2025/03/28/moonshots-initiative-to-secure-the-future-of-the-os</link><description>

I don't know if enough people are interested but it seems entirely reasonable to ask.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasn't OpenVMS stuck in a similar situation in the late 1980s, where they had tons of VAX MACRO assembly files they had to transpile to Alpha, then Itanium and nowadays x86_64?VAX is a rather different beast than 32-bit ARM and that bandaid would result in a hybrid 32/64-bit operating system, but I wonder if a similar solution could be implemented for RISC OS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context: https://www.riscosopen.org/content/documents/risc-os-moonsho...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519100</guid></item><item><title>49.

A pre-populated database which is then migrated. That seems to catch a wider class of issues than parsing sql and shielding against just checking for non-null without default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(author of the post)Just to clarify a bit, the test ofc isn't a fully general solution to solving issues with database migrations (I hinted what that might be in the blog post), although it's still useful to provide a nice error message even if a more general solution was implemented.That was not at all the goal of the post. I just wanted to appreciate how easy it was to achieve this specific task in Rust. In any other systems programming language that I used (even most other languages, except maybe for Python), I would never even imagine something like this being feasible, and so easy to do.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really interesting to read about this! That's wonderful validation for a vital digital culture and its heritage.As the creator of Glicol (https://glicol.org/), based in Oslo and working in the digital arts space, I'm always fascinated by how different countries foster creative technology. Sweden's approach in recognizing the demoscene this way is particularly encouraging.It makes me reflect on the pathways to support here in Norway. While academic environments can be very supportive (as my previous supervisors have been), navigating the broader public arts funding structures for newer digital art forms sometimes feels more challenging, especially perhaps for those working outside of long-established networks.Seeing Sweden's success in formally recognizing this kind of digital heritage is genuinely inspiring and offers food for thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a scener since the early 90s, I'm thrilled with these announcements. Personally, what I'd like to see come of it is an increase in the amount of academic studies of the scene at the intersection of art, technology, and anthropology. A careful study of the scene, what makes it unique, how it bleeds into other adjacent scenes (and what those are), sub-scenes, core elements of demoscene art and tech, all those things would be really interesting.They've all been written about by sceners in the past, but I think more outside observations would be enlightening. As a demoscener, you know what is scene and what isn't, and basically how it works. But I've found it nearly impossible to succinctly explain it to non-sceners without sounding like I'm crazy, or making it up, or giving them a very wrong understanding of core demo elements (e.g. "so it's all about doing things in small sizes?")One leg up, the scene has done a very good job archiving information about scene groups, sceners, scene productions, and sub-scene productions, giving future researchers a lot of information to start from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's 12 years old now, but I am still extremely impressed by this 64k intro https://geidav.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/making-of-turtles-al... and also by this 4k intro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YWMGuh15nE :)And overall this website is extremely interesting with tutorials and code and great explanations https://iquilezles.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533362</guid></item><item><title>2.

Often coming to completely contradictory conclusions. Some of these claims have been followed up by astronomers, who found errors in his analysis and poor statistical tests. His claims have been discussed in this sub before. Independent studied have found no significant evidence of anisotropy.https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/534/2/1553/7762193https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907..123I/abstra...https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466.3928H/abstra...&gt;Take his claims about JWST as an example. In 2024 he wrote a paper about some early data, claiming to find more galaxies rotating with the Milky Way. He claimed based on a sample of just 34 galaxies that the signal was significant. Now he has looked at a wider dataset of the same area, which should allow him to verify his analysis. But it shows exactly the opposite, more anti. So he writes a paper saying this new result is definitely significant but doesn't reflect on the fact he has written two papers which contradict each other. He has failed to reproduce his own result. The take away is that his results are not as significant as he claims. He's also looking at a tiny area, and nearby galaxies can have correlated spins. He doesn't take this into account either. There are multiple JWST fields in different directions he could examine in different directions to test his claims, there are two JADES fields, but he only publishes one.&gt;I do wish the MNRAS editors would take measures to stop publishing low quality claims like this without more robust review. If you look at the text, it’s largely repeating results from his old papers. There’s very little discussion of the new results.source: https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/1ja9i53/the_dist...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially a very dumb question, but seeing the difference between cyclones and hurricane on earth (clock-wise, anti-clock-wise)...Does it mean that we are, potentially, on one of two poles(?) of the observable universe, if we're observing most galaxies around us rotating a certain way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like we've got a few of these imbalances now where you'd expect 50:50 but instead it's skewed to one side where nature had a different ideaMatter-antimatter ratioLeft vs right handed moleculesNow galaxy spin directionsMaybe there are others I missed too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533306</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the distinction between reliability and capability in systems and engineering contexts. It emphasizes that reliability refers to the consistent performance and dependability of a system under given conditions, while capability relates to the system's ability to perform its intended functions effectively. The author argues that a system can be reliable without being capable, as well as capable without being reliable. The discussion highlights the importance of balancing both aspects in the design and evaluation of systems to ensure their effectiveness and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, the "book a flight" agent thing is a running joke now - it was a punchline in the Swyx keynote for the recent AI Engineer event in NYC: https://www.latent.space/p/agentI think this piece is underestimating the difficulty involved here though. If only it was as easy as "just pick a single task and make the agent really good at that"!The problem is that if your UI involves human beings typing or talking to you in a human language, there is an unbounded set of ways things could go wrong. You can't test against every possible variant of what they might say. Humans are bad at clearly expressing things, but even worse is the challenge of ensuring they have a concrete, accurate mental model of what the software can and cannot do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've (ex Google Deepmind researchers) been doing research in increasing the reliability of agents and realized it is pretty non-trivial, but there are a lot of techniques to improve it. The most important thing is doing rigorous evals that are representative of what your users do in your product. Often this is not the same as academic benchmarks. We made our own benchmarks to measure progress.Plug: We just posted a demo of our agent doing sophisticated reasoning over a huge dataset ((JFK assassination files -- 80,000 PDF pages): https://x.com/peterjliu/status/1906711224261464320Even on small amounts of files, I think there's quite a palpable difference in reliability/accuracy vs the big AI players.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Booking a flight is actually task I cannot outsource to a human assistant, let alone AI. Maybe it's a third-world problem or just me being cheap, but there are heuristics involved when booking flights for a family trip or even just for myself.Check the official website, compare pricing with aggregator, check other dates, check people's availability on cheap dates. Sometimes I only do the first step if the official price is reasonable (I travel 1-2x a month, so I have expectation "how much it should cost").Don't get me started if I also consider which credit card to use for the points rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535653</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant decline in users of the Honey browser extension for Chrome, as reported in March 2025. It highlights potential reasons for this drop, such as increased competition from other coupon and discount services, changes in user behavior, and issues related to privacy and data collection. The piece examines the implications for Honey and its parent company, PayPal, while also considering the broader trends in e-commerce and online shopping habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Oracle's alleged attempt to conceal a significant cybersecurity incident involving its Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. It details how customers were reportedly not informed about the breach, raising concerns over transparency and trust. The piece highlights the importance of communication from companies when addressing security vulnerabilities and emphasizes the potential risks users face when they are kept in the dark about such incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are already a customer of Oracle, I can't imagine this matters to you. You did not choose Oracle because it was a good product and they are a good company. You are a customer of Oracle because there was a backroom executive deal with the Devil. No one is surprised or outraged or even has any choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is honestly wild.Whether we like it or not security incidents have become such common place in the last several years that if they just admitted to it this entire story would have likely been shrugged off and mostly forgotten about in a couple days but instead it is turning into an entire thing that just seems to be getting deeper and deeper.  (Not downplaying the security incident, but that is the unfortunate reality).Seriously if I can't trust that I am going to actually be told and not lied too when there is a security incident at the bare minimum, why would I chose to work with a company? What is Oracle's end goal here?Are they somehow really confident that this didn't happen, maybe they don't have the logs to confirm it? Trying to think about how this is anything except them just straight up lying.I can't remember the last time we saw a company this strongly try to deny that something like this happened. Especially when according to Ars Technica:&gt; On Friday, when I asked Oracle for comment, a spokesperson asked if they could provide a statement that couldn’t be attributed to Oracle in any way. After I declined, the spokesperson said Oracle would have no comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are various state laws that require companies to notify their customers of security breaches, but they lack enforcement/teeth so they're routinely ignored. It'll never happen in our current environment but we really need a federal law that causes violators enough pain that companies will actually bother to follow the law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535953</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development of a customizable select element for web applications using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It explains the challenges of default dropdowns, such as limited styling and accessibility issues, and introduces a solution that allows developers to create more visually appealing and user-friendly select components. The post provides code examples, showcases features like keyboard navigation and accessibility enhancements, and emphasizes best practices for implementing these custom components while maintaining functionality across various devices and screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that I'm disproportionally excited about this probably dates me as an early 2000s web developer. But since selects can do things that you simply cannot recreate in HTML, e.g. have options drop downs that extend outside the viewport boundaries, makes this a really helpful feature.Now, do autocompletes and tag selectors next...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The challenge till this is widely supported (caniuse.com currently pegs it at 46% globally [1]) will be using this as a progressive enhancement that does not provide a worse or unusable experience for users with browsers not supporting it yet.In other words, don’t include critical information or functionality in the new styling that isn’t available in the underlying plain select element! But such is always a good practice anyway.Very nice to see this taking shape though! Should be a huge improvement over the div monster that custom select box replacements often are. :)[1] https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_appearance_base-selec...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It doesn't trigger built-in mobile operating system components.I worry about this. The built-in mobile operating system components are reliable, accessible, and responsive. I really like it when an input element opens the Android UI because I know how it works and that it is reliable. This applies to &lt;select&gt;, but also date/time inputs for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532830</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++ provides a comprehensive overview of compiler options and techniques aimed at enhancing code security. It outlines various compiler flags that can help mitigate vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, and code injection attacks. The guide emphasizes best practices for using these options across different compilers, such as GCC, Clang, and MSVC, and encourages developers to adopt these strategies to produce more secure software. Additionally, it offers practical examples and explanations of the impact these options have on program behavior and security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes they're embedded in the compiler itself through a patch or configure flag, and sometimes they're added through CFLAGS variables during the compilation of distribution packages. I can only really speak of gentoo, but here's a non-exhaustive list:* -fPIE is enabled with --enable-default-pie in GCC's ./configure script* -fstack-protector-strong is enabled with --enable-default-ssp in GCC's ./configure script* -Wl,-z,relro is enabled with --enable-relro in Binutils' ./configure script* -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -fstack-clash-protection, -Wl,-z,now and -fcf-protection=full are enabled by default through patches to GCC in Gentoo.* -Wl,--as-needed is enabled through the default LDFLAGSFor reference, here's the default compiler flags for a few other distributions. Note that these don't include GCC patches:* Arch Linux: https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/pa...* Alpine Linux: https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/abuild/-/blob/master/d...* Debian: It's a tiny bit more obscure, but running `dpkg-buildflags` on a fresh container returns the following: CFLAGS=-g -O2 -Werror=implicit-function-declaration -ffile-prefix-map=/home/&lt;myuser&gt;=. -fstack-protector-strong -fstack-clash-protection -Wformat -Werror=format-security -fcf-protection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are taking notes, add `-fzero-init-padding-bits=all` to the list, without this flag, GCC 15 onwards will not zero-initialize a full union if you wrote pre-C23 style ={0} and the largest member is not the first one. `-ftrivial-auto-var-init` cannot help this case. https://godbolt.org/z/7zKccfnea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533516</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely had cassette based games on the TRS-80, but most of the "wireless" transmission in my youth was via BASIC printed in the back of computer magazines. You had to type in the entire app yourself. I did this for basically every app they listed. Sometimes it was like tax prep software, but I didn't care, even though I was like 9 at the time. Yes, it took a very long time. Yes, you could easily introduce typos and bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my subjective experience, having "been there at the time", I think this was sufficiently obscure that "not really a thing" is not an unreasonable take. It's a bit like "Yes, in the 2020s we got NFTs tattooed on our bodies".Edit: Although having just googled it it seems like NFT tattoos might be more of a thing than I was aware, so what do I know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The transmissions from NOS in The Netherlands could be received here in Denmark, and I actually succeeded in downloading several programs based on the BASICODE 2 standard. At that time (eighties), people had all sorts of home computers, but this way we could actually run the same programs, whether you had a BBC computer, a ZX81 or one of the many other brands.
The way it worked was that the programs used a common (primitive) BASIC dialect, and where there was a difference, a subroutine was added with a high line number.
E.g. instead of clear screen you would just write GOSUB 100.
There's a user manual here:

&lt;p&gt;Turso is launching a public beta for its offline sync feature, which allows developers to build applications that can function without an internet connection. This feature enables users to make changes locally and sync data back to the cloud once they are online again. The blog outlines the benefits of offline-first applications, including improved user experience and accessibility. It also provides details on how developers can get started with this new feature, encouraging them to experiment and provide feedback to enhance its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, certain db write is only permitted for certain users, but when the db API is exposed, will that cause problems? A concrete example would be a forum where only moderators can remove users and posts.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of a new bat called the "torpedo" by the New York Yankees, highlighting its innovative design and potential impact on player performance. It describes the bat's features, such as its unique shape and materials intended to enhance swing speed and power. The piece also includes insights from Yankees players and coaches about their expectations for the bat's effectiveness in the upcoming season, emphasizing the team's focus on improving hitting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's quite cool (disclaimer: I am indeed a dirty Yankees fan)Hitting is really hard. If you feel up to it, and can find a public batting cage near you that has a fast pitch machine (usually maxes out 75-85mph which is 20+ mph less than your typical MLB fastball), give it a shot. When you hit the ball away from the sweet spot, especially on the parts closer to your hands, it really freaking hurts and throws off subsequent swings.If the few players who are using this bat tend to hit that spot naturally, it makes a lot of sense to modify the bat to accommodate it, within the rules like they've done here. Hitting is super, super difficult especially today with how far we're pushing pitchers. Love seeing them try to innovate.Plus, reminder, most of the team isn't using it. Judge clobbered the ball that day with his normal bat. Brewer's pitching is injured, and the starter that day was a Yankee last year and the team is intimately familiar with his game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"you can’t just make a new bat and ruin over 100 years of baseball"If this jabroni was in charge of sports, there'd be no forward pass, no three-point line, no fosbury flop. Sports should be frozen in a specific moment of this guy's choosing. MLB batting averages have been on a steady, multi-decade decline as pitching quality and strategy has improved[1], so God forbid we do something to add some offense.[1] https://apnews.com/article/mlb-vanishing-offense-allstar-b48...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If only the Yankees get access to it (e.g. they patented it and won't let other teams use it) then I could see it as an unfair advantage. In most other areas of America life, though, this innovation would be allowed or even celebrated.I imagine it will go the way of the brilliant strategic innovation a few years back of shifting defenders heavily depending on the batter's statistical hitting patterns. It'll get banned because it makes the game more boring. If home runs happen all the time, they lose their excitement. I imagine it's quite expensive or impossible to shift the outfield walls back farther in most MLB stadiums.I actually would love more of a no holds barred evolutionary battle in the MLB [1] but I know it's not gonna happen.[1] https://youtu.be/gTmLz9B8wls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43536146</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of indoor air pollution on student achievement, highlighting how poor air quality in schools can negatively affect cognitive performance and learning outcomes. Research indicates that elevated levels of pollutants like carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter can impair concentration and memory, leading to lower academic performance. The piece emphasizes the importance of improving ventilation and air quality in educational environments to create healthier learning conditions and foster better student achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm all for installing air filters in classrooms for a number of reasons, but I also think the extreme results from this study aren't going to hold up to further research.From the paper:&gt; To do so, I leverage a unique setting arising from the largest gas leak in United States history, whereby the offending gas company installed air filters in every classroom, office and common area for all schools within five miles of the leak (but not beyond). This variation allows me to compare student achievement in schools receiving air filters relative to those that did not using a spatial regression discontinuity design.In other words, the paper looked at test scores at different schools in different areas on different years and assumed that the only change was the air filters. Anyone who has worked with school kids knows that the variations between classes from year to year can be extreme, as can differences produced by different teachers or even school policies.Again, I think air filtration is great indoors, but expecting test scores to improve dramatically like this is not realistic. This feels like another extremely exaggerated health claim, like past claims made about fish oil supplements. Fish oil was briefly thought to have extreme positive health benefits from a number of very small studies like this, but as sample sizes became larger and studies became higher quality, most of the beneficial effects disappeared.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone writes whether the data actually shows what it purports to show: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/01/09/filters-be...&gt; The whole thing is driven by one data point and a linear trend which makes no theoretical sense in the context of the paper (from the abstract: “Air testing conducted inside schools during the leak (but before air filters were installed) showed no presence of natural gas pollutants, implying that the effectiveness of air filters came from removing common air pollutants”) but does serve to create a background trend to allow a big discontinuity with some statistical significance.I’m reminded of the walkback of scientific studies showing massive benefits from giving kids in third world countries deworming medications: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/23/research-glo....My beef with Matt Y.’s worldview of “scientifically driven public policy” is that the costs and benefits of public policy interventions are so devilishly difficult to study that you can’t meaningfully use them on realistic time scales to drive policy. This is an exceedingly simple hypothesis—filtering air improves test scores—that can easily be tested while controlling for confounding factors. But even then it’s hard!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was more data on the effects of gasses in the air on people.We seem to know:- Elevated CO2 in rooms impairs cognitive performance.- Elevated CO2 in submarines, at levels far higher than you would see in a normal room does not appear to impact cognitive performance.- Installing carbon filters (what this study actually looked at) might improve classroom performance.- People don’t like stuffy rooms.All this is consistent with multiple hypotheses.  It could be that we just don’t know anything about it. Or maybe there is some gas or gasses emitted by people that isn’t CO2 that makes people mildly uncomfortable and have worse cognitive performance.CO2 is certainly a good proxy for ventilation quality in a space where air is exchanged with outdoors but where the gasses in the air are not otherwise changed. Carbon-filtered classrooms and submarines are not examples of this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529257</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article compares two advanced AI models, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, focusing on their coding capabilities. It evaluates their performance in various programming tasks, analyzing factors such as accuracy, efficiency, and usability.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is a real coding problem that I might be willing to make a cash-prize contest for. We'd need to nail down some rules. I'd be shocked if any LLM can do this:https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace/issues/1414Make a GTK 4 version of Solvespace. We have a single C++ file for each platform - Windows, Mac, and Linux-GTK3. There is also a QT version on an unmerged branch for reference. The GTK3 file is under 2KLOC. You do not need to create a new version, just rewrite the GTK3 Linux version to GTK4. You may either ask it to port what's there or create the new one from scratch.If you want to do this for free to prove how great the AI is, please document the entire session. Heck make a YouTube video of it. The final test is weather I accept the PR or not - and I WANT this ticket done.I'm not going to hold my breath.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini is the only model which tells me when it's a good time to stop chatting because either it can't find a solution or because it dislikes my solution (when I actively want to neglect security).And the context length is just amazing. When ChatGPT's context is full, it totally forgets what we were chatting about, as if it would start an entirely new chat.Gemini lacks the tooling, there ChatGPT is far ahead, but at its core, Gemini feels like a better model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was using gemini 2.5 pro yesterday and it does seem decent. I still think claude 3.5 is better at following instruction then the new 3.7 model which just goes ham messing stuff up.   Really disappointed by Cursor and the Claude CLI tool, for me they create more problems then fix. I cant figure out how to use them on any of my projects with out them ruining the project and creating terrible tech debt.   
I really like the way gemini shows how much context window is left, i think every company should have this.  To be honest i think there has been no major improvement beyond the original models which gained popularity first.  Its just marginal improvements 10% better or something, and the free models like deepseek are actually better imo then anything openai has.  I dont think the market can withstand the valuations of the big ai companies.  They have no advantage, there models suck worse then free open source ones, and they charge money???  Where is the benefit to there product??  People originally said the models are the moat and methods are top secret, but turns out its pretty easy to reproduce these models, and its the application layer built on top of the models that is much more specific and has the real moat.  People said the models would engulf these applications built ontop and just integrate natively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534029</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to make sure I am understanding this.If I have an application that uses OpenAI models then this service can act as a proxy between the my application and the actual OpenAI service. It logs all of the requests that get sent to the OpenAI api. At some later time, I can go through and choose a subset of the API calls and mark them (I'm guessing as good or bad) and these get converted into a training set. I then have to create a value function as its own API that I run on my own servers somewhere (like fly.io). Then I start a training run, which I assume will use some open source AI model to regenerate responses to the training set derived from my initial OpenAI api calls. It then takes the generated responses from that open source model, sends them to my value function api which scores them, and then uses that score to apply some RL magic to the base open source model. At the end of this process I have an open source model that has been RL trained based on the captured api calls as well as the scoring from the value function.I suppose the argument here is, a RL trained open source model will perform your task better than the base OpenAI model. So your target market is, people already using OpenAI api, they have the desire and funds to experiment with RL, they have the capability of defining a value function, they are able to sift through their api calls to identify the ones that aren't performing well and isolate them, and they are willing to swap out their OpenAI model with an open source model that is RL trained if it can be shown it is more accurate.I would guess this market exists and the need is real. Defining a value function is much easier than building the infrastructure to RL a variety of open source models. So someone who wants to do this may appreciate paying for someone else who has already set up the infrastructure. And they don't want to host their own model (their already paying for OpenAI model hosting) so maybe they have no problem paying you for inference as well.Whether or not this succeeds as a business really depends on how effective RL is for the clients you find. There are two paths here, RL is wildly successful and therefore so are you. Or RL fine-tuning is unable to keep up with foundation model advancements and clients will learn it is better to wait it out on the big fellas rather than go through the time-consuming and costly process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks great.I have a few questions. 1. I'm assuming by the pricing it's "serverless" inference, what's the cold-start time like? 2. Any idea on inference costs?Also just to reiterate what others say but the option of exporting weights would definitely make it more appealing (although it sounds like that's in the roadmap).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tell you what I don't like, the game y'all are playing with billing of Slack users:  Where do you want to access #ext-customers?
    The organization you select is where you’ll find this channel in Slack. Admins will get a chance to review everything before you start collaborating.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds of the Ghost (was it Norton Ghost?) tool. I use to experiment with the file system and try out many many all kinds of softwares from Internet and software CDs. Those CDs use to come with 100s of softwares of all kind. I use to buy them and then try out every single one of them. I use to maintain an index, using IYF, to find a software in any of those CDs.Anyway these softwares use to have there crack/patch tools with them (with music and effects and whatnot). These cracks often had virus or trojen in them. I have bored my windows many many times. Ghost helped with that immensely. I had 1 or 2 fresh install with basic setup ghost backup always available. After every bork, it only took a minute to restore my windows to fresh clean state. Kaspersky was the best anti virus back then, no other tool repaired my corrupted softwares like it. Norton anti virus use to scream only after getting infected itself.We have it lot easy now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I debated building something like this for a couple years with my "Ultimate Windows 98 PC" [1]I found that I could take the machine to vintage computer events and it would (generally!) behave the entire event. I'd then take it home and put it back on the shelf for a few months. After I'd bring it back down to use it again, it'd throw a fit and usually require a reinstall! It's not disk rot since I use SSD's throughoutWhile this hasn't happened (this time) it's a constant looming concern, particularly when pressed for time to get something up and running for an event.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETxI4rA_gs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Running Win98 is still the most reliable way to get Discworld Noir to actually run; a gem of a game, made almost useless by the aggressive DRM practices of the time.Bookmarking this for future use :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43530889</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to automate story logic in narrative-driven projects, such as games or interactive fiction. It explores the benefits of integrating LLMs to enhance storytelling by generating dynamic plots and character interactions based on player choices.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GPTel is a very powerful interface for working with LLMs in Emacs. It took me a while to understand that its real value isn't what you get with M-x gptel, which creates a dedicated chat session and buffer, but rather the ability to sling prompts, context, and LLM output around in a native Emacs way. You can add to the context from dired, from a file, from a buffer, you can select from various prescribed system prompts for different functionality, you can prompt from the minibuffer, the kill-ring, the existing buffer, a selection, you can have the responses go to the minibuffer, the kill-ring, a buffer, the echo area -- it's extremely flexible.I have a little helper function that uses gptel-request that I use while reading Latin texts. It sets the system prompt so the LLM acts as either a Latin to English translator, or with a prefix argument it breaks down the grammatical structure and vocabulary of a sentence for me. It's very cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the most promising uses of LLMs that I have found in my own work. Many times I have an idea for a refactor or even a feature but I have this mental reluctance just due to the amount of code I would have to write. Like, I have this counter in my head on the number of key-strokes it will take to write a wrapper object in several places, and I hesitate.Just being able to tell an LLM "rewrite all of this code using this new pattern" and then dozens of code sites are correctly updated is a huge help. It makes me consider bigger refactoring or minor features that I might normally skip because I am lazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gwern shared an idea how to exploit the strength of current-generation LLMs, despite their weaknesses, for "create your own adventure"-style fiction. https://gwern.net/cyoa Having people vote on AI-generated potential continuations should yield better results and cut costs at the same time.From the title I thought this was an implementation of Gwern's idea, but it's not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43536463</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an introduction to the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), explaining its role in email retrieval and management. It outlines the differences between IMAP and other protocols like POP3, highlighting the advantages of using IMAP for accessing emails from multiple devices while maintaining synchronization. The piece also covers key features of IMAP such as folder management, message flags, and server-side operations, making it a valuable resource for developers and users looking to understand how IMAP works and its benefits for email handling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started writing a guide to IMAP back when I was working on an email client: https://github.com/rmccue/griffin/tree/master/docs/imapPulling large amounts of data for things like threading can be difficult on certain servers; my preferred approach ended up being to pull every ID and thread ID to maintain an in-memory tree. (This was, iirc, partially because Gmail’s implementation was slightly crippled with relation to threading.)(I never finished the guide because I stopped on the project, alas - if IMAP were easier to work with, I might have finished it! And sadly, no JMAP support on Gmail, and the gateway was broken.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the extra interested… reminded me of this one: https://explained-from-first-principles.com/email/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working on some email stuff and I think probably four things are vexing about IMAP:- The grammar is hard. I built a parser using lpeg and I'm incredibly glad I did--doing it ad hoc won't lead to good results.- It's an asynchronous protocol. You can send lots of requests to a server and you have to tag them so you can match them up with responses later. You don't generally want to do that in a client; i.e. you don't want to do these transactional things over an async connection and track state across all of it. You want to like, block on deleting things, renaming things, sending things, etc.- IMAP is multi-user--it's built around the idea of multiple clients accessing the same mailbox at the same time and streaming updates. Another thing you really don't want to deal with when building an email client.- There's functionality that you basically shouldn't use; the big one is search. Even the specs more or less say "good luck using this".You can group all this under the a heading of "we thought people would use this over telnet", but attachments and non-plain-text email I think made that non-viable.I think this all means probably every non-web email client treats IMAP like POP and keeps its own store. I haven't done a survey or anything, but I'd be surprised if that weren't true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43513967</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;JEP 8349536 proposes the addition of a new method to the `java.lang.reflect.Method` class in the Java Development Kit (JDK), allowing users to retrieve the corresponding `Method` object for constant method references, enhancing the reflection capabilities of the Java language. This enhancement aims to simplify the retrieval and usage of method references in reflective operations, thereby improving developer productivity and making it easier to work with the method reference feature introduced in Java 8. The JEP includes an overview of the motivation behind the change, its implementation details, and the impact on existing code and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm, not a bad approach.I think the one thing that'd be nice is if I could somehow tell the JVM from a class that this class is open for final mutation rather than needing special flags passed into the JVM or special manifests in the Jar.  It's often pretty clear to me, as a dev, what I when I need something to have final mutation (generally only with serialization objects).For example,    @FinalMutatableByReflection
    class Foo {
      final String bar;
    }

That'd allow me to transition code by just adding an annotation where it needs to be while also getting the benefit that final is really final everywhere else in code that isn't working with serialization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written my fair share of nasty reflexive code for testing or for abusing libraries, but I don't think I've ever overwritten final fields in this way. Private fields, sure. But not final.Sounds like a good evolution to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there was a r/nottheonion for tech :DJokes aside, I thought the ability to mutate final fields was already removed/restricted after Java 17 :/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538919</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;A significant discovery at Cambridge University involves a previously unknown medieval manuscript related to the Arthurian legend of Merlin. This manuscript, considered a vital addition to the study of literature and history, sheds light on the narrative surrounding the legendary wizard, revealing unique insights into its themes and cultural impact. The discovery not only enhances the understanding of medieval texts but also highlights the ongoing relevance of these stories in contemporary discussions about folklore and literature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe one of the early maps of the americas by Amerigo Vespucci was found in a similar way. Re-using paper to hand making the binding, padding the covers, wrapping the bound signatures before the outer leather or board was added was surprisingly common. John Le Carré uses it in "the perfect spy" as a mechanism to pass secret information to an amateur book binder.It speaks to me of Robert Grave's fictitious account of Claudius deciding rather than hiding them, to leave his (fictional) autobiographical scrolls just lying around, let history decide what to keep and what to dispose of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that a 13th-century Arthurian manuscript was quietly hiding inside a 16th-century book cover for centuries is wild enough on its own, but the way they virtually unfolded it without causing damage feels almost as magical as the story of Merlin itself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"La suite vulgate du Merlin" might translate as: "the vulgate follow up of THE Merlin", which I find quite curious. Modern French would rather say: "DE Merlin". It was as if Merlin was not a proper name but the name of some creature of the Merlin species, or some kind of properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529709</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The website "KnightRide" offers a platform for users to plan and participate in social bike rides within a community. It emphasizes the importance of cycling as a way to promote health, build community connections, and explore local areas. The site provides tools for organizing rides, sharing routes, and connecting with other cyclists, as well as resources like safety tips and event calendars to enhance the biking experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This could use a bit more explanation. For instance:How many points and how many bonus moves do you get for a capture? Does it depend on what you capture? (It looks like it's one bonus move whatever you capture, but more points for more valuable pieces; 1 for a pawn, 3 for a bishop, so I'll guess it's 5 for a rook and 9 for a queen.)Does "Beware of attackers!" mean (1) you aren't allowed to move the knight to a square that's attached, (2) you will get some points deducted when you do, or (3) nothing, it's just flavour-text? (It looks like it's #2, a loss of one point each time you move to a square that's attacked.)The instructions don't mention the "clean board" bonus; I think they should.I'd write it something like this:Complete each level by reaching the target within the given number of moves.Each piece you capture gives you one more move, and points according to the value of the piece.You lose one point any time you move to a square that's attacked.Your score for the level is the number of moves you had spare at the end, times the number of points you earned. Double if you captured all the pieces!(... Except that it looks as if there's some further "streak" mechanic, which I haven't tried to figure out the details of.)If that's too long, put it behind a clicky-button, and just say "Get your knight to the target square. Earn points for getting there quickly without being attacked, and capturing pieces on the way." plus a button labelled something like "Full rules".Maybe make the notification when you capture a piece say something like "+3 points / +1 move"?If the levels get fairly crowded then it might be expensive to get the computer to find the best possible score, but it shouldn't be hard to make it find a pretty good score. You could present that, either at the start or after the user finishes the level, as a target, and congratulate them when they meet or even beat it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Way back when Flash was a thing, one of the teachers at my kiddo's school started a chess club. They never played a full game of chess, but other games that taught the kids how to move the pieces and not burden them with the strategy of a full game. I decided to try to turn a few of those into Flash based games. It was fun making each of the pieces with the rules limiting their movement which became a game on its own just to show where pieces could go or not. Then adding more pieces to start playing the games. I never worked it up to the point of having player vs computer though. Glad to see other people also thinking chess based games could be made without needing a vs computer as well.I think this game would be perfect for a young kids chess club. Nice job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was fun.  I played for a few minutes and like how there seem to be multiple ways to play the game-1. just get through the level and not worry about losing points2. get through the level without losing any points but not worrying about clearing all the pieces3. absolute perfection where you clear all the pieces without losing any pointsThis flexibility makes it good for serious players but also kids/casual players.  Great job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43515622</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;France has fined Apple €150 million for imposing excessive pop-ups that hinder users from rejecting tracking on their devices. The country’s competition authority concluded that Apple's practices created an unfair advantage in promoting its tracking features, which goes against consumer rights. The ruling emphasizes the importance of transparent and user-friendly consent processes and aims to protect users from being overwhelmed by repetitive prompts that complicate the decision to opt-out of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actually Apple were fined because they don't apply the same standard to their own pop-ups that allow users to reject tracking. On Apple popups you seem to need one click, while on 3rd party popups you need to confirm twice.So the fine seems to be for treating 3rd parties differently from their own stuff.They could make their own popups require double confirmation instead...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Benoit Coeure, the head of France's competition authority, "told reporters the regulator had not spelled out how Apple should change its app, but that it was up to the company to make sure it now complied with the ruling,"Sounds like a good shakedown to me. Wait until they tweak it then fine them again for getting it “wrong”. I wonder if they even got the chance to change anything before they were fined the first time. And all because the regulator wants users to be advertised to more?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No good deed goes unpunished. Don't protect users' privacy, and you get flak from regulators for "not doing enough". Protect users' privacy, and you get flak from regulators because it's "too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue". You see similar levels of cynicism directed at Google. When firefox banned third party cookies, it was almost universally welcomed, but when Chrome does it the cynics come out and say how it's actually some sort dastardly ploy to cement their position in the ad market because third party adtech firms are disproportionately harmed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43537593</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation (which runs Wikipedia) does not directly pay editors for content. oka.wiki is a non-profit organization that funds editors, mostly to translate articles.Their top 3 articles in English:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsala_of_Wala_in_the_Nsongo_Di...* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vril_Society* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_and_anime_fandom_in_Pola...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if the editors are objective, doesn't mean that their work doesn't create bias.Say StdA and StdB are competing for wider adoption. A Corp. can pay for an editor to create a comprehensive article on their standard which, even if it's objective, can influence more people into adopting the better documented option.Of course, this can happen even without paid editors being involved, and there's nothing stopping B Corp. from doing the same, but I just wanted to point out that avoiding bias might not be always easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While Oka itself claims to be free of the systematic bias of Wikipedia, how can you be so sure that Oka itself is not free of systematic bias, even if it tries to be as public and transparent as possible?So unfortunately, even if Oka claims to be doing for the good, I still see it somewhat as a political group, even if our values are aligned, and thus, "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If systemd is the reason, there are several good distros without systemd (I run Void Linux in particular).If "kubesomething" is the reason, there's no requirement to use it. I think most people don't run it on their home servers.If containers are the reason, then again, they are not a requirement. But they are pretty similar to BSD's jails. I don't think they are particularly complex.FreeBSD has a number of strong suits: ZFS, a different kernel and network stack, a cohesive system from a small(ish) team of authors, the handbook, etc. But the usual Linux hobgoblins listed above are a red herring here, to my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use FreeBSD for my home server and I have for years.  For me, the biggest reason is just the stability from a user perspective.  I don't mean system stability, although it has been rock solid, I mean the stability in terms of administration - the tools don't change frequently.`ifconfig` just works, like it has worked for 20 years.  On my linux servers, it's all swallowed into `ip addr` now.  I don't mind that, I certainly understand why these things change, but when I update an Ubuntu server I always worry that next time I log in a tool I am used to will be broken or removed.I simply don't have those concerns on FreeBSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ZFS is probably the biggest reason for me. I have a machine with a zfs pool running samba and nfsd.Philosophically I tend to prefer *BSDs over Linux. I have a few FreeBSD machines, one OpenBSD, and one Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534533</guid></item><item><title>28.

If some dumb bozo wants to get the ISP deluxe package of gateway/router/DNS sniffer/shit-tier WiFi AP all rolled into one box, fine. The opt out should be as simple as “I have my own equipment, I understand that any support call with you will stop after a public IP is found to be working on premise, now get the hell out of my way thank you”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d note that (outside of Comcast possibly being mad at you breaking the modem), sometimes they push a bad update and you need to reset the modem, and last time I did that I needed to step through the initial setup on the WiFi network before activating bridge mode. So if the wifi hardware is broken you might need to jump through hoops to get through that setup (or swap the modem).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I doubt they'd find it - the SOP for issues with these modems must just be to replace them with a new one - something tells me Comcast wouldn't look kindly on physically modifying rental equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43527521</guid></item><item><title>30.

When confronted she refused to give it back, and the defendant forcibly retrieved it from her.Is there a name for this fever dream style of writing, that even if you follow up on all the loose ends dropped throughout, find that some of them evaporate under scrutiny?1. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stephen-tyler-bieneman-not-guil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You too can ride in such a vehicle - just visit the Columbia Icefield in Banff, Canada.https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/attractions/columbia-i...They drive out tourists on to the ice (as long as it is still there, couple decades left).I did it, very cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sad I won't get to ride Ivan when I (hopefully) go back to the ice this fall.

&lt;p&gt;The paper discusses advancements in machine learning, particularly focusing on the concept of neural networks and deep learning. It explores various methodologies and approaches used in training these models, emphasizing their applications across different domains including computer vision and natural language processing. The authors aim to provide insights into the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of these technologies, as well as the challenges faced in achieving efficient and accurate performance. Overall, the work contributes to the understanding of deep learning techniques and their potential for future developments in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this paper overestimates the benefit of what I call isoheaps (partitioning allocations by type). I wrote the WebKit isoheap implementation so it’s something I care about a lot.Isoheaps can make mostly neutralize use after free bugs. But that’s all they do.  Moreover they don’t scale well. If you isoheap a select set of stuff then it’s fine, but if you tried to deploy isoheaps to every allocation you get massive memory overhead (2x or more) and substantial time overhead too. I know because I tried that.If an attacker finds a type confusion or heap buffer overflow then isoheaps won’t prevent the attacker from controlling heap layout. All it takes is that they can confuse an int with a ptr and game over. If they can read ptr values as ints then they can figure out how the heap is laid out (no matter how weirdly you laid it out). If they also can write ptr values as ints then control they whole heap. At that point it doesn’t even matter if you have control flow integrity.To defeat attackers you really need some kind of 100% solution where you can prove that the attacker can’t use a bug with one pointer access to control the whole heap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short paper, so can be easily summarized. The claim is that security can be improved by these compiler and hardware assisted measures:    - Stack Integrity
    - Control-Flow Integrity
    - Heap Data Integrity
    - Pointer Integrity and Unforgeability

They cite the deployment of these measures on recent Apple hardware as evidence of their effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the cited paper:"These four types of integrity, do not establish memory safety, but merely attempt to contain the effects of its absence; therefore, attackers will still be able to change software behavior by corrupting memory."and the paper then goes on to say, about Apple's implementation of the cited techniques:"This intuition is borne out by experience: in part as a result of Apple’s deployment of these defenses since 2019, the incidence of RCE attacks on Apple client software has decreased significantly—despite strong attack pressure—and
the market value of such attacks risen sharply.""Decreased significantly" is not "eliminated"; indeed, you could paraphrase this as "the combination of these techniques has already been shown to be insufficient for security guarantees".Which is not to say that these mitigations are a bad idea; but I think their benefits are significantly over-sold in the paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532220</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;"The Egg" is a short philosophical story that explores the concept of life, death, and reincarnation. The narrative follows a man who dies and encounters a divine entity, leading to a profound discussion about the nature of existence. He learns that he will be reborn repeatedly, experiencing life in various forms and eras, all with the aim of maturing spiritually and ultimately becoming a god-like figure. The story emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the cyclical nature of life, suggesting that every individual is part of a larger, infinite journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms of Service; Didn’t Read (ToS;DR) is a project that aims to simplify and evaluate the terms of service and privacy policies of various websites and online services. It categorizes them based on their user-friendliness and transparency, providing users with easy-to-understand summaries and ratings. The goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about the services they use by highlighting key aspects of terms and policies, such as user rights, data usage, and consent requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does a good job of showing how completely unparsable ToS are:https://tosdr.org/en/service/1448 says both:"You maintain ownership of your data: This service does not claim ownership over user-generated content or materials, and the user * doesn't need to waive any moral rights* by posting owned content."and"You waive your moral rights"Edit: I have no energy for figuring out which of these statements is more true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gread idea. Odd first impression.Wikipedia has 4 thumbs down 1 thumbs up and is grade B. Tor has 0 thumbs down 3 thumbs up and is grade C.DuckDuckGo has only 1 thumbs down: "Instead of asking directly, this Service will assume your consent merely from your usage." and is grade B, presumably because of this. Startpage is grade A, has no thumbs down, but going on startpage does not prompt me to agree to anything either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweet! One suggestion is to somehow normalize the requirements by company type? Like, for example, PayPal gets a thumbsdown for&gt; You must provide your identifiable informationbut that's reasonable for a company like PayPal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533096</guid></item><item><title>35.

I'm already deluged with nešili texts of the "Triple your barley yields with this one weird trick" type or, "Phrygian raiders don't want you to know this secret". Lately they've been trying to get me into some kind of currency scheme. I'll stick with bartering, thank you very much.I'm thinking of just blocking all cuneiform texts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tool url is not listed in TFA, but a simple google search results in the following:https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/TLHdig/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If we wanted to digitize all ancient texts, what would it take? How many are there? Starting at the beginning of written history ~5,200 years ago to ~2,000 years ago, how many texts do we have from each millenia or century? Are they accessible to be digitized?What about earlier symbols and similar potential communication? For example, caves sometimes have marks that seems to have some symbolic meaning, such as slashes that seem like counts. How many are there to digitize?I'm curious about the scale of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43498399</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the features and benefits of Kagi's Family Plan, which allows families to create individual accounts for each member, offering personalized settings and access. It emphasizes the inclusion of a dedicated Kids Login, designed to provide a safe and controlled browsing experience for children. Parents can manage and monitor their children's usage, ensuring a child-friendly environment while allowing access to appropriate content. The plan caters to the needs of families seeking to balance internet access among different age groups while maintaining security and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Kagi or anyone could work on, is an actually working version of YouTube Kids.I literally Pi-Hole Blocked all of YouTube after my son started reading the Bible after a Minecraft Influencer started preaching throughout most of his videos to the point my son became a bit too much interested in the topic.Not that I'm a rabid atheist or would deny my child such a thing, but if THAT can enter my 8yr olds brain via his short allowed time where he can browse by himself, i'm worried what else is coming his way through it.I'd love to give him access to valuable videos between rules I describe by natural language and can test myself, but nothing like this exists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; to ensure children are not exposed to harmful content.Strong claim. I like the idea, but wish they were more realistic about what they can provide. If you ever get a Reddit result you're likely one click away from harmful content.That said, I like the lenses applied in this case. It may be the best we can get today in terms of search filtering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kagi seems like a cool company - I'm not a customer yet. I'd like there to be technology companies I can trust - perhaps like Kagi.I have been really happy with NextDNS though. My kids, not so much. But hey ... that's parenting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538338</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The world gets both better and worse. it is something that I regularly get voted down for saying here, but IMO the west is unduly pessimist because it had a golden age from winning the cold war until the late 2000s, took an overly optimistic view of the future and the inevitability of progress (remember "the end of history") and cannot cope with things going back to normal.Things get better, sometimes they get worse. Generally people are better off materially than they have ever been, but people do not change all that much morally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; frightened into rationalityAn oxymoron if I ever heard one. To become rational means letting go of fears (to a large extent). I fear that one reason we fail to act is that we are guided by fear. Fear makes us focus on the wrong things. And I fear that in a civilized society fear becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Fear makes us obsess about the problem and how to avoid it in the very narrow and short term. It doesn't make us very good at long term planning and execution. It's an instinct that is evolved for animals that want to avoid predators, not for civilization builders.Building a civilization requires vision, big plans and the feeling that we can afford bold ideas. We need to take risks. But how can we take more risks when we're constantly afraid of the future? How can we build a better future when all we do all day is imagining the worst possible future? If our minds are constantly occupied by dystopia we can't plan for anything else. So that's what we build.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent book on the theme using Zambia in the 70s as a case study:Expectations of Modernity explores the social and cultural responses to a prolonged period of sharp economic decline. [1]"From now on, it's just down, down, down..." sighed one informant (p. 13). As Ferguson argues, "Zambia's recent crisis is not only an economic crisis but a crisis of meaning, in which the way people are able to understand their experi- ence and imbue it with significance and dignity has (for many) been dramatical- ly eroded" (p.15).

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the incident involving a Marine fighter jet that ejected over North Charleston. It details the circumstances of the ejection, the response from emergency services, and the safety measures in place for such situations. The piece highlights the significance of this event in relation to military operations and the impact on the local community, including any potential risks associated with military aircraft flying overhead. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the operations of military aircraft in civilian areas.&lt;/p&gt;

It's just the long known story: A pilot ejects from a malfunctioning (but likely flyable) jet, gets cleared in the first two investigations because most other pilots would have interpreted the situation similarly, promoted, and then fired less than 4 months after moving with his family to the location of his new role. It remains unclear why but scapegoating to distract from the plane's issues is commonly seen as the most likely explanation, with all the risks it entails (pilots becoming more hesitant to eject or openly admit mistakes so safety can be improved).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had one short sentence in there that he still had a tiny alternate primary flight display. Still had control surfaces. He knew he was descending and his authorized air space. Pull up, look at the pfd, do some resets, follow helmet malfunction protocols.There was very little about a devils advocate side to the story.I could imagine others joking about ejecting for minor warnings or trolling him. Especially in the marines.Do a FOIA on all ejections because his is just one. He had a good 27 year career and ended as a colonel with retirement benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531013</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;BrowserCraft is a platform that allows users to run legacy Java applications directly in their web browsers. It utilizes CheerpJ, a technology that compiles Java bytecode into JavaScript, thereby enabling seamless execution of older Java-based software without the need for plugins or additional installations. The site highlights the ease of use, compatibility with various web environments, and the benefits of modernizing applications by making them accessible through any standard web browser. It targets developers and organizations looking to preserve and transition their Java applications into a more accessible format.&lt;/p&gt;

That was a long time ago, I remember playing it as a kid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 years ago, I watched a YouTube recording of a meetup talk given by one of the CheerpX engineers:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JUs4c99-moIn it, they showed a functional demo of porting an OSS multiplayer C++ game entirely to the browser with WASM.Afterwards, I read some of their engineering content and was blown away.It's been fascinating to watch the CheerpX/CheerpJ progress from afar over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535769</guid></item><item><title>45.

A JS version using BigInt can go unlimited.For reference the included example text took a surprising 2 billion iterations to discover the correct 8 digit hash which is about what you'd expect from random (i.e., half the state space of 16*8 = (2*4)*8)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The SHA-256 hash of this sentence begins with 0573e7473.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503833</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of crate training in the context of programming, using the metaphor of taming mythical creatures like Tiamat and Cthulhu. It explores how the C++ programming language can be refined and organized using efficient management techniques, akin to training and controlling chaotic forces. The author emphasizes the importance of creating structured and usable libraries (or "crates") while managing complexity in C++. This approach aims to enhance productivity and reduce errors in software development, making powerful tools more approachable for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There isn't anything new here to defend against lifetime-related UB. For that it simply references https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21145, which is just a summary of existing dynamic mitigations --- which don't fix UB at the language level, impose performance tradeoffs, and in the case of pointer integrity, require hardware support that excludes e.g. x86.Look at it this way --- mature products like Chrome are already doing all of that wherever they can. If it was enough, they wouldn't worry about C++ UB anymore. But they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it is great that this is happening, it seems a bit getting too late to the party.There is also the whole issue that standard working group, and the folks that actually work on C and C++ compilers, nowadays it is a very thin Venn diagram for the intersection of both groups.So it remains to be seen how much of this will actually land on compilers, and in what form.Nevertheless there are many C++ written tools that most likely will never be rewritten into something else, so any improvement is welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In C, we made clear in C23 that there is no true time-travel UB and have eliminated about 30% of UB in the core language for C2Y as part of an ongoing effort that will eliminate most of the simple cases of UB. We also have plans to add opt-in memory safety mode proving full spatial and temporal memory safety.Having said this, I think the sudden and almost exclusive focus on memory safety is weird. As a long-term Linux user, this is not my main problem. This is what people building app stores and non-free content distribution systems need and they now re-engineer the world according to their needs. There are lot of things compromising my online safety and freedom, and certainly memory safety issues are not very high on this list.Finally, what Rust achieves, and what a memory-safe mode in C will hopefully also achieve in the future, is also just an incremental improvement. As long as there in unsafe code, and in practice there will be a lot of unsafe code, there is no perfect memory safety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531914</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;guMCP is a GitHub project that provides a Python library for a multi-criteria decision-making process, allowing users to evaluate and prioritize options based on multiple criteria efficiently. The library aims to streamline decision-making in various fields by implementing algorithms for decision analysis, particularly focusing on methods like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). It features various functionalities, including data input handling, decision matrix creation, and ranking outputs, and is intended for both individual users and developers looking to integrate decision-making capabilities into their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks HN! (cofounder here)Just a couple of things that I think makes GuMCP different than other options out there:- Having a unified way to run each server via stdio and sse. Basically all existing providers either let you connect through their hosted sse service or let you clone and run stdio locally. Rarely is there a very simple way to do either/or, especially when it comes to hosting your own sse server out-of-the-box. Existing options like Zapier's MCP are closed source, so it's not so simple.- Setting a flexible and generic framework for integration auth with MCP servers. Currently, methods of authentication vary from server to server. We provide a unified mechanism of auth for every single server that is importantly generic enough for you to be able to host it on your own. We do this through having a base 'AuthClient' that is used across each of our servers, which supports any arbitrary implementation. For local use, we provide a LocalAuthClient that sets a standard for integrations, OAuth and otherwise.- We also have a GumloopAuthClient that uses your existing credentials for Gumloop, which will then exact similarly to how Zapier or Composio do their MCP servers, with auth taken care of easily. Difference is you have the flexibility to also host it on your own with your own AuthClient, or run locally with stdio and local auth as well.- Ready-to-deploy sse through one URL. If you want to host on your own, the repository out-of-the box can be deployed with ALL sse servers hosted under a single URL.- For open source contributions, your server will be deployed and hosted instantly. No need to fiddle with devops to get a SSE server available remotely for your implementation. This makes it way simpler for less technical folks (or just those who don't want to deal with infra) to make their ideas a reality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone else hosting MCP servers in a generally available way? Seems like that's the end goal given the network transports (especially the one in new spec revision).Seems like everything I find requires running locally or hosting your own instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;very similar to my goals but i went different way.I chose wasm for package format. so everyone can choose the programming language they are familiar with. caveat: rust still has best support for wasm. everything else is hit or miss.I chose OCI registry for package publishing because that's what everyone already has in their infrastructure. or just use dockerhub/GHCR.https://github.com/tuananh/hyper-mcp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535889</guid></item><item><title>50.

But I guess that’s also the kind of person buying the £500 tshirts linked in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: the author here, Derek Guy, is the infamous (and brilliant) "Menswear Guy" on X.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Guyhttps://x.com/dieworkwear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Few years back, I thought it was wise to invest in some semi-pricey clothes which were intended to suite me for a while. The only formal stuff I had at the time was my Dad’s, or something I thrifted, which didn’t quite fit.Some pants, shirts, which I could put a jacket over for something more formal. Some shorts and shirts for the gym.Every single one of those pants ripped, to my surprise, because some of them were $150-$250. Some ripped in the belt loops, others between the legs. The dress shirt is barely holding up, there are little plumes of ripped material on the side.Each time they ripped, I replaced them with something I found for $15-35 at Target. Not a single rip.I still keep the dress shirt, because it’s the only one I have, and I’m not at all sure what to replace it with.I dislike the shirts that Target sells because the frame they use is of a long, skinny man, with small arms, and an extremely wide neck. Not sure how the fuck that happened. But the material is perfectly fine.If anyone knows where I can find a nice shirt (both collared and others for the gym), that’d be great. I’m set on target pants, though. They are indestructible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43528496</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every perf guide recommends to minimize allocations to reduce GC times, but if you look at pprof of a Go app, GC mark phase is what takes time, not GC sweep. GC mark always starts with known live roots (goroutine stacks, globals, etc) and traverse references from there colouring every pointer. To minimize GC time it is best to avoid _long living_ allocations. Short lived allocations, those which GC mark phase will never reach, has almost neglible effect on GC times.Allocations of any kind have an effect on triggering GC earlier, but in real apps it is almost hopeless to avoid GC, except for very carefully written programs with no dependenciesm, and if GC happens, then reducing GC mark times gives bigger bang for the buck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking out the first example—object pools—I was initially blown away that this is not only possible but it produces no warnings of any kind:    pool := sync.Pool{
        New: func() any { return 42 }
    }

    a := pool.Get()

    pool.Put("hello")
    pool.Put(struct{}{})

    b := pool.Get()
    c := pool.Get()
    d := pool.Get()

    fmt.Println(a, b, c, d)

Of course, the answer is that this API existed before generics so it just takes and returns `any` (née `interface{}`). It just feels as though golang might be strongly typed in principle, but in practice there are APIs left and rigth that escape out of the type system and lose all of the actual benefits of having it in the first place.Is a type system all that helpful if you have to keep turning it off any time you want to do something even slightly interesting?Also I can't help but notice that there's no API to reset values to some initialized default. Shouldn't there be some sort of (perhaps optional) `Clear` callback that resets values back to a sane default, rather than forcing every caller to remember to do so themselves?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calling mmap “zero copy” is generous. I guess we glaze over the whole page fault thing, or the fact that performance is heavily dependent on how much memory pressure the process is under.This is the same n00b trap that derailed the llama.cpp project last year because people don’t understand how memory maps and paging works, and the tradeoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43539585</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my Core Memories when it comes to science, science education, and education in general was in my high school physics class, where we had to do an experiment to determine the gravitational acceleration of Earth. This was done via the following mechanism: Roll a ball off of a standard classroom table. Use a 1990s wristwatch's stopwatch mechanism to start the clock when the ball rolls of the table. Stop the stopwatch when the ball hits the floor.Anyone who has ever had a wristwatch of similar tech should know how hard it is to get anything like precision out of those things. It's a millimeter sized button with a millimeter depth of press and could easily need half a second of jabbing at it to get it to trigger. It's for measuring your mile times in minutes, not fractions of a second fall times.Naturally, our data was total, utter crap. Any sensible analysis would have error bars that, if you treat the problem linearly, would have put 0 and negative numbers within our error bars. I dutifully crunched the numbers and determined that the gravitational constant was something like 6.8m/s^2 and turned it in.Naturally, I got a failing grade, because that's not particularly close, and no matter how many times you are solemnly assured otherwise, you are never graded on whether you did your best and honestly report what you observe. From grade school on, you are graded on whether or not the grading authority likes the results you got. You might hope that there comes some point in your career where that stops being the case, but as near as I can tell, it literally never does. Right on up to professorships, this is how science really works.The lesson is taught early and often. It often sort of baffles me when other people are baffled at how often this happens in science, because it more-or-less always happens. Science proceeds despite this, not because of it.(But jerf, my teacher... Yes, you had a wonderful teacher who didn't only give you an A for the equivalent but called you out in class for your honesty and I dunno, flunked everyone who claimed they got the supposed "correct" answer to three significant digits because that was impossible. There are a few shining lights in the field and I would never dream of denying that. Now tell me how that idealism worked for you going forward the next several years.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this in 1999 when entering university. It was so refreshing hearing a student provide a glimpse into the boots-on-the-ground reality of undergrad life at these world-renowned institution.The closing sentence is also prescient; the author pivoted to CS, ultimately completing his doctorate at the University of Wisconsin at Madisonhttps://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kovar/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I TAd a semiconductor fabrication lab class 20-odd years ago.  Mostly it was about making sure the students had the absolute fear of God put into them about working with HF, but there was also a bit at the end where you actually got to do a voltage sweep and characterize your transistor. If in fact you had made a transistor rather than a needlessly complicated resistor. The other TAs and I passed this paper around and thought it was just hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43545917</guid></item><item><title>3.

How well it achieved that goal is, of course, debatable, but it has survived nearly a century in that form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love The Guardian! It is one of my two ongoing donations, along with the Internet Archive.Back when it was The Manchester Guardian, they produced one of the most remarkable TV commercials in history, "Points of View":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsccRkLLzUI first saw this commercial when Will Hearst (yes, of that Hearst family) screened it at a Software Development Forum meeting in the late 1980s.I wish this were a better transfer, but it is what we have.

I guess there needs to be a way for people to share new lessons to practise, it gets complicated with copyright pretty fast.For real "lessons" you'd probably need to start at chord progressions, go into scales and how the chords relate back to those, then move to these types of soloing technique lessons.AlphaTab is the star here https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab - it's been maintained tirelessly for years by Daniel Kuschny.I've started to build this type of lessons sitea few times in the past and never really got it together enough to release anything. I've done scale/chord/arpeggio tools: https://github.com/webprofusion/scalex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome!
I made a very similar tool to help myself practice progressions specifically for banjo: https://banjo-rolls-deluxe.twait.dev/Far fewer features than your app, but just having a tool to help nail down the muscle memory of pre-built progressions has been massively helpful for me as a banjo-player-in-training.Your exercise builder is awesome and something I was planning on building into my site, might take some inspo!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43512470</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and best practices for building large-scale applications using the Nue.js framework. It highlights the importance of architectural decisions, scalability, modularity, and performance optimization. The author emphasizes the need for efficient state management, effective routing strategies, and the integration of modern development tools to streamline the development process. Additionally, the piece provides insights on maintaining code quality and collaboration within development teams to ensure successful project delivery. Overall, it serves as a guide for developers looking to create robust and scalable applications with Nue.js.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see a lot of people angry at "Nue" in various ways, and I can't help but think these are people heavily relying on React and missing the overall issue. The issue is that these huge frameworks have made the web a horrible slow mess. I deal as DevOps/SRE daily with these services, and finding one that will do a first load under 10s is close to impossible. When a simple home page dashboard or a notes page takes more than 10s to load on a 10G connection peered within 5ms of the host, and 95% of this is spent in JS, that's when you know the typical current webapp has reached a massive state of bloat only supported by fast browser engine, and people not having expectations.I'm not hopefully Nue would revolutionize this since there are plethora of Web SaaS companies just wanting to use "common" frameworks...  but I can at least root for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what they're replacing react with: https://nuejs.org/docs/view.htmlIt's an untyped view layer kind of along the lines of early angular 2.0.The model files are plain javascript.So no typings anywhere. Which is fine, I guess this is targeting the vuejs crowd. Maybe their marketing should pivot a little bit in that direction, most react people now use TypeScript because first class types in your view layer are super useful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. But I went for Svelte. Invested in Svelte and SvelteKit. Wrote a decent sized app (not toy example, pretty feature right, tens of forms and screens if you will) and later I looked back at React.And I discovered that:  - React is not that hard if you understand the hooks.

  - React is lightweight too. For my use case at least.

  - React is boring technology at this point which is good.

  - The ecosystem is huge. You cannot have React Query like library and that's just one example.

So I'm sticking to React for next few years especially when the React compiler is already being used inside Facebook and Instagram and released as public beta.Even React Native supports React compiler and I don't see this support going away rather getting better.PS Edit: React compiler leaves not much for runes in Svelte or its compiled nature. I don't like Svelte much after runes because it feels like you're not writing Javascript rather a notation that looks like Javascript. Post React compiler, much of the hooks hell is not needed in complex scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543241</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One more thing, just in general: Some people are complaining that some languages work better than others.  This seems to be a common issue now with the availability of AI (both voice recognition and LLMs): there's a temptation to expand into as many languages as possible, simply because you can.My advice would be to have languages default to an "alpha" state, and only progress them to "beta" and "1.0" state when they reach certain milestones, as defined by community feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd straight up pay 5 or 10 bucks a month for this if it was like... 200% more functional/featured/professional/working. VERY good proof of concept and I love it. Target language is german fwiw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've checked out the Japanese one, but I'd say that it's definitely no where near "real-world content" IMO. Just the usual tortuously slow-paced, artificially dumbed-down dialogue you'd expect out of classroom recordings.Most of the videos also contain subtitles, which defeats the purpose of the exercises (you can disable the video manually though). Another issue is that some of the words are segmented very unnaturally (e.g. [み][ません]), so it's unclear how you're expected to fill them in.In the end if what you really want is "real-world content", then you just need to go out there and find them yourselves - they're everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543235</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of excitable cells, specifically focusing on their role in generating action potentials and facilitating communication within the nervous system and muscle tissues. It explains how these cells respond to stimuli, the mechanisms behind their excitability, and the importance of ion channels in regulating their activity. The piece aims to educate readers on the fundamental properties of excitable cells and their significance in physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have frequent ectopic beats that I feel as a flutter / heavy beat on my chest. The doc says it won't kill me but it is extremely uncomfortable at times. This has been a great material to learn about the inner workings of heart cells.BTW Here's an ECG from my Apple Watch showing 3 such beats (you can't miss them): https://link.ekin.dev/l1Vc3GdfIf you happen to have these, just get checked out by a cardiologist. They are almost always benign but the frequency / daily amount are reasons for concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exciting simulations! :) And an excellent explanation.From time to time I get episodes of sudden tachycardia¹. It's a very strange feeling: one second everything is fine, the next my heart jumps in my throat and starts beating at 230 bpm (not a typo). After a while, just as quickly as it came, the tachycardia goes away and I'm back at whatever HR I was before the trigger. If it doesn't go away by itself, breathing in deep and holding my breath typically does the trick. It's like a light switch! A bit scary, but also very fascinating.Thanks for explaining so well what goes on "under the hood"!¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_supraventricular_ta..., I believe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you for all the kind responses.I also want to make a similar article, where I calculate an ECG for the simulation, and then make and explain the changes necessary to make the ECG look realistic. A main challenge will be that the depolarization has to happen very fast relative to the repolarization, which may be computationally difficult for a cell-based simulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504940</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;KOReader is an amazing program that has progressed at amazing speed over the past few years, particularly when it comes to the user interface. (It can still be overwhelming, because of the sheer number of features, but it is much better organized.)To give you an idea of how different it is from commercial products: it actually tracks reading in a useful way. It shows a chart of how long you have spent on each page, so you can figure out which parts of a book you have not yet read. That is really useful when jumping around technical books. If you are interested in tracking your general reading habits, there are handy views that shows which books you have read and when you read them (either by time of day or across a month).As for reading PDFs, well, eInk has its limitations and KOReader does it's best to work around them. If you want to read a multicolumn paper on a small screen, you can configure it to go down one column then right back to the top of the next column. If you want there to be overlap between the screens when panning, you can configure that. You can also have it display which parts were overlapping, so you don't get lost when it displays the next part.There is tonnes of other stuff in there. I just mentioned those two because I use them the most. Overall I would say it feels like KOReader was designed by people who want an amazing reading experience, rather than by people trying to sell novels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very impressive how the almost the entire application is written in lua(JIT). Particularly impressive how it is fast enough to do CPU blitting/blending[0]I wonder why is lua so rarely utilized like this on its own. Such a neat language.[0]: https://github.com/koreader/koreader-base/blob/master/ffi/bl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely love KOReader. I use it on my Kindle 3 and have moved my parents and brother over to using it on their Kindles as well. You can even install it on relatively new models thanks to the recent WinterBreak gaolbreak.There was some discussion about it on HN not long ago:All Kindles can now be jailbroken | 1377 points by lumerina | 2025/02/17 | https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43073969I found KOReader's Android app a tad buggy, but the experience is wonderful on Kindles.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a famous April Fools' joke that occurred in 1957 when the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) aired a segment about spaghetti trees in Switzerland, showcasing a family supposedly harvesting spaghetti from trees. Many viewers believed the broadcast, leading to a flood of inquiries about how to grow spaghetti plants. The piece explores the cultural impact of the prank, highlighting how it reflects the gullibility of the public and the influence of media. It also examines the joke's lasting legacy in the realm of pranks and media manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In high school, we had a Netware 3.12 environment, and the Guest account was enabled, albeit with very limited privileges. But for some reason, Guest could still use NET SEND, which popped up a little message in the bottom row of the destination machine's display.The whole district shared a T1 connection to the internet. Which was more than plenty for email, but as this world-wide-web thing started gaining traction, it became quite the bottleneck. And as some of us had discovered mp3 files, the slowness simply would not do.One day there was some severe weather and a power hiccup during school hours, and every station got a message from ADMIN informing us that the server room was running on UPS power and we should save our files and log out immediately.Hmmmm.A few weeks later, one of the bright sparks in the technology program realized that having everyone log off would free up some bandwidth. So he logged onto the next machine over as GUEST, and used a NET SEND ALL "SERVER ROOM POWER FAILURE - 11 MIN OF BATTERY REMAIN - SAVE FILES AND LOG OFF" and sure enough, within about a minute, the whole T1 was his. Did what he needed to do (i.e. leeching an entire fserv) for about 8 minutes, then NET SEND ALL "POWER RESTORED - RESUME YOUR WORK".A few weeks later some hot commodity had just dropped and he repeated the drill. It still worked.Nobody noticed that these messages came from GUEST, even the district administrator, who eventually called an electrical contractor to figure out why the power in the server room was so flaky. Someone eventually pointed it out to him, which got a very red-faced "that's really clever but please knock it off", and no further punishment. The next day, the Guest account had a lot fewer privileges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the real value in this writeup up of a clever little prank is the way the author/prankster could map out the social reactions and how the spirit in which the prank was received cascades through a whole entire organization in ways that hinge on little cues, little things about who knows who and whether you're physically present before a particular impression crystallizes in people's minds.It's just such a great example of how people could react either with uproarious laughter or by feeling that some boundary has been violated and can think that either reaction was the most self-evidently obvious one in the world and the reasons for it were entirely contingent. It's something where you can only really witness the irrationality of it if you're in the author's position.I once heard it speculated that philosophy might have emerged in Greece because the circumstances of being merchants engaging in interstate trade, you could see the way that certain things regarded as received knowledge were really customs, peculiar to certain cultures and locations. When you're the prankster and you can see different people reacting in different ways that seem to be tied to patterns of the circumstances of how they experienced it, you can kind of witness the contingency of those reactions playing out in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At my very first real job, back in 1997-98, I worked in tech support for an insurance company. We used Lotus Notes for email (initially just internally, with no Internet email). I had programmer access to Notes because I built some forms for user requests (Notes was more than email, it also had forms, a whole programming language, workflows, etc.).Some Fridays (once a month?) were casual dress days where you could wear jeans instead of slacks (this was the distant past, when most professional workplaces still had real dress codes). This was an IT/Eng-wide thing, so we'd get an email reminder about this from an admin person in the department.One time, I thought it would be funny to send my own email announcing pants-less Friday. So I took a copy of the email this admin sent and adjusted it accordingly. I did of course specify that you still had to wear underwear. I'm not a monster. Because I had programmer privileges in Notes, I was able to forge the sender so that it appeared to come from the department admin person, not me.I _meant_ to send it to the small email group for just the other tech support folks (around 15 people or so). But I accidentally (?) sent it to all of IT/Eng, around 200-300 people, IIRC. Oops.Needless to say, my boss's phone started ringing off the hook. I immediately went over to tell him what I'd done. He wasn't pleased, but I didn't get fired. I did have to write an apology email.Of course, many folks in the department later told me it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen happen.Soon after, I moved to programming at a different company. I think this was a good thing for many reasons, but one reason is that it was more challenging, so I wasn't bored with time on my hands to do stupid things like send prank emails to my coworkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543743</guid></item><item><title>11.

A couple of dendrites though, a lightning strike, there are things outside of their control that could turn the building holding this collection of batteries into a very impressive incendiary device.

It never occurred to me until I reached the end that this wasn't a "enjoy this tool we made" post, but instead a "look how awesome we are" post. :-/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was reading about the cinematography of _Collateral_, possibly the first large budget feature film to be shot digitally, and one of the issues back in 2004 when it was made was the amount of storage required for digital video and the risk of not being able to retrieve the images from the data stores:&gt; “We did massive testing with the hard drives, and everything was great, and then we had an experience where we shot, and when we sent in the material, they couldn’t get the information off the hard drive,” said Cameron. “So the studio went ballistic and was like, ‘There’s just no way we can we can let you guys do this.’”&gt; The compromise was the production would record to hard drives as well as SRW tape. And unlike today, verifying the digital footage was equally cumbersome and tension-filled.&gt; “We recorded everything two or three times on decks that we carried with us,” said Beebe. “So we were backing up, two or three times.”https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/michael-mann-c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Netflix has been spinning up ingest centers around the world, where drives can be dropped off, and within a matter of hours, all original camera files are uploaded into the Netflix ecosystem.Netflix is looking to sell shovels to as many people as possible, it seems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43541759</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've noticed that the formalization of methods described by AWS parallels what we need in technical documentation. Complex systems require not just formal verification but also structured documentation following MECE principles (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).In my experience, the interfaces between components (where most errors occur) are exactly where fragmented documentation fails. I implemented a hierarchical documentation system for my team that organizes knowledge as a conceptual tree, and the accuracy of code generation with AI assistants improved notably.Formal verification tools and structured documentation are complementary: verification ensures algorithmic correctness while MECE documentation guarantees conceptual and contextual correctness. I wonder if AWS has experimented with structured documentation systems specifically for AI, or if this remains an area to explore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A key concern I've consistently had regarding formal verification systems is: how does one confirm the accuracy of the verifier itself?This issue appears to present an intrinsically unsolvable problem, implying that a formally verified system could still contain bugs due to potential issues in the verification software.While this perspective doesn't necessarily render formal verification impractical, it does introduce certain caveats that, in my experience, are not frequently addressed in discussions about these systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leslie Lamport gave the closing keynote at SCaLE 22x this year, talking about formal methods and TLA+. He mentioned some previous work Amazon has done in that area.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsSDvflzJbc&gt; Coding isn't Programming - Closing Keynote with Leslie Lamport - SCaLE 22x&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43547593</guid></item><item><title>14.

It seems the original studio has released a modernized version available on many platforms (including VR):https://cyan.com/games/myst/I missed out on Myst in its heyday, but have always wanted to check it out after hearing so many great things.Curious if any superfans think it would be better experienced as the original in an emulator or similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a similar thing but for Silent Hill 2: https://connorjclark.github.io/sh2-graph/It's much more linear.source: https://github.com/connorjclark/sh2-graph&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43549293</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;CERN scientists have discovered evidence of quantum entanglement in sheep, marking a significant breakthrough in the understanding of quantum mechanics and its implications for biological systems. The research demonstrates that quantum entanglement is not solely confined to atomic or subatomic particles but may also occur in larger biological entities. This finding opens new avenues for exploring the role of quantum phenomena in living organisms and poses intriguing questions about the intersection of quantum physics and life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure what's supposed to be publication-worthy here. This is common knowledge for anyone who's ever interacted with sheep on a farm, in their natural, fermionic superfluid state. If you turn over a sheep and tickle its ticklish underbelly, you get a sheep-laugh (a hilarious sound) only about 50% of the time; the other 50%, you'll hear a sheep laughing from the opposite end of the meadow. Because, you cannot definitively say if it was *this* sheep you tickled, or *that* other, identical one. They are indistinguishable baa-tickles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, I see it's useless internet day, catch you all tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; set the baa for a new branch of quantum physicsI'll admit I got a few paragraphs in before that made it click.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43545349</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite trick is to install with English (World) language to avoid auto-install of all sorts of crap. Windows Store won't work in this mode, but it's just a matter of reverting to your preferred language after first boot.https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/15gk07n/english_...Edit: in my experience, changing the language to something else immediately after install is done still adds the crapware automatically. I think I needed to reboot once or twice for whatever post-install service Windows runs to no longer get executed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since i‘ve been doing this sort of thing for many years here are some basic rules:
- Get LTSC (W10) or IoT/Enterprise (W11) images to begin with
- Get https://www.ntlite.com/ .. you won‘t find any other tool which does a better job at removing packages, adding drivers, etc. Worth every penny with great support.
- Use GroupPolicies to configure your system. Take the time and download them for Office, Edge, Chrome, Firefox and update those that come with Windows.
- Integrate drivers not only for the base image but also in the recovery and setup image.
- Install a firewall (binisoft is fine)
- Use NextDNS
- If you don’t mind the security implications: Disable Defender, SmartScreen, BootGuard and VBS (use bcdedit)
- Disable Microcode loading (delete the DLL)
- Disable Spectre/Meltdown mitigations
- If you need Office: Use the LTSC versionMost third party tools are outdated or do stupid stuff which isn’t needed. You can silence Windows with the right GroupPolicies quite easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The level of workarounds that windows requires never cease to amaze me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518570</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "toposort" presents an implementation of a topological sorting algorithm, which is used to order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear sequence based on their dependencies. The repository provides detailed documentation, usage instructions, and examples to help users integrate the algorithm into their projects. The code is available in multiple programming languages, and contributions from the community are encouraged to enhance and improve the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For something like task scheduling in a build system, if you use an up-front partition of the tasks like this, you may have a task that has all its dependencies fulfilled because tasks may have different durations, but still remains unscheduled.For example, with this input:    $ cat data.file
    root: parentA parentB
    parentA: C D
    parentB: E F

Asking the package tool for the sorted sets gives me:    $ ./zig-out/bin/toposort-cli --data data.file
    Processing succeeded.
      Topologically sorted sets: [ { C D E F }  { parentA parentB }  { root }  ]
      Topologically sorted list: [ C D E F parentA parentB root ]
      Nodes: [ root parentA parentB C D E F ]
      Dependency tree:
      [ C D E F ]
        C -&gt; [ parentA ]
          parentA -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        D -&gt; [ parentA ]
          parentA -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        E -&gt; [ parentB ]
          parentB -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        F -&gt; [ parentB ]
          parentB -&gt; [ root ]
            root -&gt;
        
If we follow the README's advice to parallel process set-by-set, we can easily have starvation: once `C` and `D` are finished, we are ready to start `parentA`, even if E and F are still work-in-progress.How would I use the API of this package to detect and start the task `parentA` as soon as `C` and `D` are finished? I guess when a task is finished, I can ask for the list of dependent tasks, and for each of them, check if all of their dependencies are finished, and if so start the task. But this real-world need feels un-met; it feels odd to me to focus on the sorted sets instead of more practical scheduling.That is kind of doing Kahn's algorithm iteratively during the build. It would be cool to try and optimize that for maximum performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been enjoying zig myself quite a bit, I'm fairly confident I could do some larger projects in it (excluding comptime since it's missing features I sorely need for some of my current projects.) I like it a bit more than C/C++ in a lot of cases, I need it to be pushed just a tiny bit further before I can really dedicate effort towards large projects in it. I was even curious if I could implement the features I need myself (there is even a proposal already), but got the answer "Just don't." (I don't blame andrew, he already has a lot on his plate and I'm a stranger to him.) So I'm at the point of either waiting for the feature or forking it, haven't decided what I'm going to do though.More on topic for the project though, did you have any project ideas for this? I think I could use this for my opencv node editor, I just did the naive method of marking all outputs dirty as their inputs nodes got reprocessed. I assume this would fix the potential problem of recomputing a node twice? I also see you mention "Cycle detection and cycle reporting." but what specifically happens if I do have a cycle? Does it just give up or is it something like best effort?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that have not implemented toposort or don't remember it: 1) only directed graphs without cycles can be topologically sorted (DAGs) 2) there can be more than one topological order and 2) reverse post order of depth first traversal from every unvisited node shields a topological order.In JavaScript:    function toposort(graph = { a: ['b', 'c'], b: ['d'] }) {
      const order = [];
      const visited = new Map();
      
      function dfs(node) {
        const status = visited.get(node);

        if (status === 1) throw new Error("Cycle found.");
        if (status === 2) return;

        visited.set(node, 1); // In progress.
        const adjacent = graph[node] ?? [];
        for (const neighbor of adjacent) dfs(neighbor);
        visited.set(node, 2); // Done.

        order.unshift(node); // Reverse post order.
      }

      for (const node in graph) {
        if (!visited.has(node)) dfs(node);
      }

      return order;
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43549618</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just curious why the decision was made to go with PascalCase for the DSL? Is this meant to help React devs feel at home? Seems very un-Rubylike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phlex is an amazing project. Makes frontend fun again. I've built my own UI library using DaisyUI and Tailwindcss that we use in all our Rails projects: https://github.com/inhouse-work/protosIt cannot be overstated how nice it is to move away from erb and into pure ruby. Private methods as partials is a game changer for refactoring your UI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used a rendering library like Phlex back in 2010. I hated it back then and I still don’t like it.They claim it’s faster than ERB but only show micro benchmarks. This is basically a form of lying.This approach stinks for a lot of reasons:- it adds a ton of pressure on the garbage collector.
- the backtraces suck to debug. Ruby is better now than in 2010, but it’s still lame.
- your templates are largely static. Yet when it lives as code you can’t cache any of it. An efficient ERB generator is just cached strings concatenations. Very efficient in Ruby.Finally, Rubyists hate this and it’s why the community is slowly dying. Almost all your frontend should be in JS/JSX at this point. Even the static stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43548108</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a critical evaluation of conversational interfaces, arguing that they often fail to enhance user experience and can lead to frustration. It highlights several shortcomings, including limitations in understanding natural language, the potential for miscommunication, and the increased cognitive load on users. The author suggests that while conversational interfaces may seem appealing, they frequently do not meet the practical needs of users and may be more of a hindrance than a help. The piece advocates for a careful consideration of when and how to implement such technologies in design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This clearly elucidated a number of things I've tried to explain to people who are so excited about "conversations" with computers. The example I've used (with varying levels of effectiveness) was to get someone to think about driving their car by only talking to it. Not a self driving car that does the driving for you, but telling it things like: turn, accelerate, stop, slow down, speed up, put on the blinker, turn off the blinker, etc. It would be annoying and painful and you couldn't talk to your passenger while you were "driving" because that might make the car do something weird. My point, and I think it was the author's as well, is that you aren't "conversing" with your computer, you are making it do what you want. There are simpler, faster, and more effective ways to do that then to talk at it with natural language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's where the article goes wrong:1. "Natural language is a data transfer mechanism"2.  "Data transfer mechanisms have two critical factors: speed and lossiness"3. "Natural language has neither"While a conversational interface does transfer information, its main qualities are what I always refer to as "blissfull ignorance" and "intelligent interpretation".Blisfull ignorance allows the requester to state an objective while not being required to know or even be right in how to achieve it. It is the opposite of operational command. Do as I mean, not as I say."Intelligent Interpretation" allows the receiver the freedom to infer an intention in the communication rather than a command. It also allows for contextual interactions such as goal oriented partial clarification and elaboration.The more capable of intelligent interpretation the request execution system is, the more appropriate a conversational interface will be.Think of it as managing a team. If they are junior, inexperienced and not very bright, you will probably tend towards handholding, microtasking and micromanagement to get things done. If you have a team of senior, experienced and bright engineers, you can with a few words point out a desire and, trust them to ask for information when there is relevant ambiguity, and expect a good outcome without having to detail manage every minute of their days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Star Trek continues to be prescient. It not only introduced the conversational interface to the masses, it also nailed its proper uses in ways we're still (re)discovering now.If you pay attention to how the voice interface is used in Star Trek (TNG and upwards), it's basically exactly what the article is saying - it complements manual inputs and works as a secondary channel. Nobody is trying to manually navigate the ship by voicing out specific control inputs, or in the midst of a battle, call out "computer, fire photon torpedoes" - that's what the consoles are for (and there are consoles everywhere). Voice interface is secondary - used for delegation, queries (that may be faster to say than type), casual location-independent use (lights, music; they didn't think of kitchen timers, though (then again, replicators)), brainstorming, etc.Yes, this is a fictional show and the real reason for voice interactions was to make it a form of exposition, yadda yadda - but I'd like to think that all those people writing the script, testing it, acting and shooting it, were in perfect position to tell which voice interactions made sense and which didn't: they'd know what feels awkward or nonsensical when acting, or what comes off this way when watching it later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43542131</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advantages of using F#, a functional-first programming language. It highlights F#'s strong type system, expressiveness, and conciseness, which enable developers to write more reliable and maintainable code. The author emphasizes F#'s interoperability with .NET, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including data science and web development. Additionally, the article argues that F# promotes a functional programming paradigm that can lead to better problem-solving and increased productivity for developers familiar with its concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;F# was for me the best functional language when I looked at rewriting a Ruby on Rails app.
I wanted to go with a functional language, as it seems to better fit my thinking and reasoning, and I looked at Haskell, Ocaml, Scala, F#.Being a stranger to Microsoft technologies, F# was the least likely to be chosen, but easily became the first choice.
Haskell's purity made it hard to adopt (for me), Ocaml's ecosystem is subpar (there wasn't even a clear choice for a library to interact with postgresql, I couldn't install the latest version due to its reliance on an obscure tool whose name I forgot and didn't get help on the forum), and Scala is seems complex....F# was surprisingly easy to get started with. The community is mis-managed by a corporate-minded approach (requiring people to become member of the F# software foundation to get access to the official slack!), but its members are friendly, smart and ready to help. The ecosystem is great with access to all the dotnet libraries (some complain there's a mismatch as most of those are developed for use with C#, but I rarely got in trouble for using them).There are also great libs and frameworks available. Like https://github.com/SchlenkR/FsHttp to easily interact with http servers, to the point that I find it easier to use than a dedicated library. Or https://github.com/CaptnCodr/Fli , to run commands. And last but not least, https://www.websharper.com/ is the best web framework I have encountered across all ecosystems. Their reactive approach to web ui really allows me to develop complex interfaces in a maintainable way.This became a longer message than I thought, probably due to my enthousiasm for the language. For complete transparency, the situation is not perfect, and in my experience the tooling is not the best.If you want more info, I blogged about it a couple of months ago: https://www.asfaload.com/blog/consider-fsharp/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did try F#, but I was new to .NET ecosystem. For 1 "hello world" I was quite surprised by how many project files and boilerplate was generated by .NET, which put me off.I am all for FP, immutable, and modern languages. But then where are the jobs and which companies care if you write good code?Now everyone wants languages which are easy to use with AI, while reducing workforce and "increased productivity". I have been programming for 20 years and know 4-5 languages, in India it was worse but in EU at-least I can make a sustainable living by writing Java / TypeScript. I cannot even find jobs with Kotlin + TypeScript which pay well, forget getting jobs in Elixir / Clojure / F# (there maybe a handful of opportunities if I will relocate for around 70K/year). That is why I have mostly given up on learning niche languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm completely convinced that F# (along with Scala, Haskell, and OCaml) adoption has stalled due to having ridiculously bad build systems. More significantly, they are being passed up in favor of Rust, which is a great language but nonetheless a bad fit for a lot of problem domains, simply because Rust has a superior build system. Hell, 80% of the reason I choose Rust over C++ for embedded work is because of the build system.It baffles me that there are languages with non-profit foundations and are financially backed by multiple corporations which still have bad build systems. It is the most important investment you can make into a programming language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43546004</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Me and my team used these yellow tracking dots to reconstruct shredded documents for a DARPA shredder challenge over a decade ago. You can see our program highlight the dots as we reconstruct the shredded docs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzZDhyrjdVo
Thanks to that, we were able to win by a large margin. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had the experience of poking at tracking dots recently for circumstances I won't share here.Do y'allself a favor and get a blue LED flashlight and point it at a color print. It's shocking how many  are printed. It looks like a spattering of sand across the entire page!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; My printer does not print tracking dots. Can I hide this fact?&gt; If there are really no tracking dots, you can either create your own ones (deda_create_dots) or print the calibration page (deda_anonmask_create -w) with another printer and use the mask for your own printerThe thought of being able to “spoof” the tracking dots of another printer has interesting implications for deniability. Though I guess in this case you’d still need access to the original printer to print the anonmask…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551397</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see some workflow engine action on Hacker News! :-)I'm currently building pgflow, which is a simple, postgres-first engine that uses task queues to perform real work.Have explicit DAG approach, strong typesafety, nice DSL in TypeScript and a dedicated task queue worker that allows it to run solely on Supabase without any external tools.I'm super close to the alpha release, if you guys want more info, check out the readme for SQL core (https://github.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/tree/main/pkgs/core#rea...) or my Twitter (https://x.com/pgflow_dev).Hope that grabs someone attention :-)
Cheers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is really cool!That said, my impression is that Airflow is a really dated choice for a greenfield project. There isn't a clear successor though. I looked into this recently, and was quickly overwhelmed by Prefect, Dagster, Temporal, and even newer ones like Hatchet and HamiltonMost of these frameworks now have docs / plugins / sister libraries geared around AI agentsIt would be really helpful to read a good technical blog doing a landscape of design patterns in these different approaches, and thoughts on how to fit things together well into a pipeline given various quirks of LLMs (e.g. nondeterminism).This page is a good start, even if it is written as an airflow-specific how-to!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Truthfully have been a little skeptical of how many workloads will actually need “agents” vs doing something totally deterministic with a little LLM augmentation. Seems like I’m not the only one that thinks the latter works a lot of the time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538164</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a bit confused. I thought the main selling point of Tauri was that it uses the OS’s native WebView to create lighter apps compared to something like Electron. So why would I want to bundle a Servo or Verso? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of Tauri?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don’t know, Tauri is a lightweight electron alternative which doesn’t bundle browser nor a nodejs-like runtime.To me piggybacking on the system webview is the main selling point. Tauri-made bundles usually clock in at a few MBs, compared to 100+ with electron.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago I saw someone mention that Tauri would soon also just include Chromium, because in practice using a native webview loses a lot of the ostensible portability of a browser-in-a-desktop app (they claimed native webviews can differ a lot between OS's). Maybe that was overly pessimistic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518462</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ha, I love the "rescue ops".This will not primarily be for rescue ops. This will be for supporting Marine standin operations on and within the first island chain. The marines have been trying to figure out how they can handle sustainment and logistics in that environment.You can read some wonkish article about this (back in 2022) https://warontherocks.com/2022/09/sustainment-of-the-stand-i... . You'll note that the article does suggest revisiting seaplanes as a distribution option.With a few hundred miles range, these craft would be suitable as one way island to island hoppers, or 2 way over the horizon ship to shore transports. For a sense of scale, its ~140 miles from Luzon to Scarborough Shoal (one of the contested islands in the South China Sea).The "Viceroy" craft that Regent has mocked up on their website claims 180 mile range, 3500lb of cargo / 2 crew + 12 passengers.EDIT: And to be clear, the article title says "to get", but the article makes clear, this is basically a testing and development contract. There's no certainty that the Marines will get this capability in any meaningful way. Probably better to replace with "to test". This is particularly important because the commercial version of this craft is also still in development and testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is like the old Soviet Ekranoplans [1].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lun-class_ekranoplan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why the title clarifies "for rescue ops".Is there anything inherent to this technology that prevents it from being used for anything else? The article body insists on "demonstrations relevant to specific defense operations" which sounds quite broad and not limited to rescue ops in any way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510238</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository showcases a lightweight, easy-to-use publish-subscribe messaging system called Pico PubSub, designed for use in JavaScript applications. It facilitates asynchronous communication between components by allowing them to subscribe to and publish messages, enhancing modularity and separation of concerns. The repository includes installation instructions, usage examples, and API documentation, making it accessible for developers looking to implement a simple pub-sub pattern in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529774"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The API feels wrong. The object that was passed to pub() is the object that should be received by the callback passed to sub().The use of EventTarget/CustomEvent is an implementation detail; it should not be part of the API.As a result, every callback implementation is larger because it must explicitly unwrap the CustomEvent object.Essentially, the author made the library smaller by pushing necessary code to unwrap the CustomEvent object to the callsites. That's the opposite of what good libraries do!The mentioned nano-pubsub gets this right, and it even gets the types correct (which the posted code doesn't even try).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In similar spirit, a minimal implemention of KV store, in 22 bytes:  export default new Map&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not a huge fan of using CustomEvent for this.. esp. in terms of interoperability (which for these &lt;kb challenges probably doesnt matter)personally, i'll just roll with something like this which also is typed etc:    export function createPubSub&lt;T extends readonly any[]&gt;() {
      const l = new Set&lt;(...args: T) =&gt; void&gt;()

      return {
        pub: (...args: T) =&gt; l.forEach((f) =&gt; f(...args)),
        sub: (f: (...args: T) =&gt; void) =&gt; l.add(f) &amp;&amp; (() =&gt; l.delete(f)),
      }
    }

    // usage:
    const greetings = createPubSub&lt;[string]&gt;()
    const unsubscribe = greetings.sub((name) =&gt; {
      console.log('hi there', name)
    })
    greetings.pub('Dudeman')
    unsubscribe()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529774</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What this mostly seems to demonstrate is that hip-pop is endlessly derivative. That might be a consequence of their data source:&gt; To build this project, we used the dataset of hundreds of thousands of songs on Genius.com accessible through their API, over 200,000 of which were “connected” in some way by sample, interpolation, cover, or remix.Genres where sampling is openly and explicitly acknowledged are going to be massively over-represented. It would be cool build a relationship network using feature extraction on the actual audio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once had the realization that a riff from Metallica's "The Four Horseman" was the same as that from Tom Petty's "Last Dance With Mary Jane" except, as I learned several years after the realization, it is actually the riff from "Sweet Home Alabama" which was introduced in a session as a joke by the guitarist to make fun of the drummer for having narrow musical knowledge. He was correct in his assumption that the drummer wouldn't recognize it, and it was included in the final version of the song.The story: https://youtube.com/shorts/nY6CPOtN47w?si=K_9EKvKGbgnuGKSgThe riffs: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2V6HbSkAD5g&amp;pp=ygUgZm91ciBob3J...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a similar vein, I maintain a website[0] where users can submit songs that sound like other songs. Several times this has helped me figure out where I’ve heard a riff or melody before (when it’s not a direct sample, which I usually find on whosampled.com).0: https://memalign.github.io/m/similarsongs.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551352</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see why you’d need software to calculate comp, if your comp system is so complex!As a case study in simplicity: our sales people get 1xMRR for each deal closed, or 2xMRR if the deal signs an annual contract. SDRs get a flat amount for each demo sat (doesn’t have to close, but does have to be accepted by the AE). The amount is equivalent to 0.75xMRR for a typical customer.That’s really all you need in SaaS. This has scaled from less than 1M ARR through to… more than 100x bigger than when it started.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needs to also model when to increase targets when it looks like Sales are in danger of hitting them /sarcasm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small nitpick ...I see "Commission Rate (%)" as an input (when normally I see it as "Sales Target" as the input - which derives your commission rate)Typically I see, $X is your Target Commission and $Y is your Sales Target.(and when you divide those two figures, it equates to your % Commission Rate)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43516325</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Javice has been convicted of fraud for falsely claiming to have millions of customer accounts when she sold her company, Frank, to JPMorgan Chase. The court found that she had significantly inflated the number of actual student users of her financial aid platform, leading to JPMorgan's decision to acquire the startup. The ruling highlights issues of deceptive business practices in the tech industry, with Javice facing possible prison time and further legal repercussions as the case unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Frank’s chief software engineer, Patrick Vovor, testified that Javice had asked him to generate synthetic data to support her claim that the company had more than 4 million users. When Vovor asked if that was legal, prosecutors said, Javice and Amar assured him that it was — and told him they didn’t want to end up in orange prison jumpsuits. Vovor testified that he refused to help. “I told them I would not do anything illegal,” Vovor told jurors.&gt; Seeking to dent Vovor’s credibility, defense lawyers suggested he was resentful that Javice didn’t want to date him.That is one hell of a defense&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fraud is fraud, but I'm happy JPMorgan got caught up in this mess. Buying a promising startup for its technology or product is one thing, but the bank literally only cared about the personal data of its supposed 4 million high school and college aged users. Good riddance the whole thing imploded and there weren't real teenagers being spammed credit card and car loan offers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand how one could sell a company with millions of fake users and not expect the purchaser of that company to realize those users are fake?I understand how one could think you'd get away with it if one were lying to investors who might lack the ability to verify the claimsBut actually selling the company? How would that possibly work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43509733</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  It can also be improved; I know BLE is not _that_ effective under rubble.It's a tough problem to solve because you're up against the laws of physics and the very boring (and often counterintuitive)  "Antenna Theory". Bluetooth is in the UHF band, and UHF isn't good for penetrating anything let a lone concrete rubble.To penetrate rubble effectively you really want to be in the ELF-VLF bands, (That's what submarines/mining bots/underground seismic sensors use to get signals out).Obviously that's ridiculous. Everything from ELF to even HF is impossible to use in a "under the rubble" situation because of physics[1]. Bluetooth (UHF) might be "better than nothing" but you're losing at least 25-30 dBs (which is like 99.99% signal) in 12 inches of concrete rubble. VHF (like a handheld radio) can buy you another 5 inches.Honestly I think sound waves travel further in such medium than RF waves.[1]: Your "standard reference dipole" antenna needs to be 1/2 or 1/4 your wave length to resonate. At ELF-VLF range you need an antenna that's 10k-1k feet long. You can play with inductors and loops to electrically lengthen your antenna without physically lengthening it, but you're not gonna get that below 500-200 feet. The length of a submarine is an important design consideration when deciding on what type of radio signal it needs to be able to receive/transmit vs how deep it needs to be for stealth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. That said, I think that unless Apple and Google install something like this  by default, it won’t get much traction, because you can’t download the app when you really need it, and most people won’t think to download it before then.I just went through Helene in Asheville last year and it was painfully obvious that our cloud overlords have overlooked the offline disaster use case. Basically, when you’re in a situation where you desperately need technology to help, you’re on your own. I was imagining that tools like this would be great, but without the cloud, I was helpless.Maybe instead of trying to get users to install this, it could be a proof of concept to show what’s possible, and to say to Apple and Google: install this basic lifesaving tool on every phone by default?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool! I have been really enjoying using Meshtastic and LoRa lately. It feels like a blessed relief from the toxic swamp of the regular internet. I love pinging stupid radio messages across the bay without depending on any third-party infrastructure. Maybe in addition to the literal rubble of a life threatening disaster we can use tools like this to dig ourselves out from the psychological rubble of the information superfund site we have built for ourselves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551767</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Pragmatic Open Source Contributor" discusses the mindset and strategies for effectively contributing to open source projects. It emphasizes the importance of understanding community dynamics, documentation, and project goals, encouraging contributors to start small, seek guidance, and actively engage with maintainers and other contributors. The article also highlights the value of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and being adaptable, ultimately aiming to foster a more inclusive and productive open source environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My personal addition to an otherwise great article.Remember that you make your contribution because you or your company get something out of it. Don't expect any enthusiasm or kudos from the project's side. If these come, consider them a bonus. The contribution process will be slow. If you need the changes you are proposing, you will have to live with a fork or workarounds in your code for a while.Explain all the above to your company. Expect them to be completely clueless on how open source works, even if they are developers themselves.Personal anecdote on this: I had a team lead who insisted we directly submit a patch because "people would be thankful that we fix their code". And actually expected that they would have merged our fix before the end of our sprint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great blog! Great points about just running your own fork if needed and testing your own patch in your own system for a while. I would be very happy as a maintainer if someone put in that much effort for a fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to increase the liklyhood of your contribution being merged, do:* Provide unit-tests* Good types* No breaking changesAnd if you want breaking changes or grand new features to be merged, you have to show activity in the issue tracker or fix open bugs first, to show the maintainer that you are willing to deal with the fallout or support requests that follow after a PR gets merged. This is not to be rude. This is seeing a PR through the eyes of a maintainer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43515877</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an interview with the creator of "Deluxe Ski Jump," a popular ski jumping video game, where he discusses the game's development process, inspiration, and impact on gaming culture. The creator reflects on the challenges faced during the development, the game's unique mechanics, and how it has evolved over time. He also shares insights into the community of players and the game's lasting legacy in the world of sports simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a time when everyone played this in Poland - because of Adam Małysz's hype. It felt like the golden age of ski jumping, at least here. The game ran very slowly on my first 100 MHz CPU, which kinda helped with timing the jump. I could get it to run a bit faster by pressing the magic "turbo" (boost to 120 MHz) button on the case for a while, until the system BSoD'd. Another popular thing alongside it was so-called "Małysz" malware, which would spread via infected version of this game. I remember getting the game on a diskette and finding out it just formatted my drive with Windows (95?) install upon reboot. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tbh in Poland this game was called privately by all my colleagues "Małysz" - because people were so into ski jumping and Małysz was our hero. So I guess the huge fan base was in Poland at that time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rare game where having worse PC actually made you perform better. It was easier to time the jump perfectly. I recall starting 5 instances of it to slow it down as a kid and beating records. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43505340</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations and challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the need for critical assessment of their effectiveness and ethical implications. It highlights issues such as biases, inaccuracies, and the potential for misuse in various applications. The author advocates for a more cautious approach to deploying LLMs, calling for transparency and improved regulatory frameworks to mitigate risks while leveraging their capabilities in a responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's a more general bifurcation here, between logic that:1. Intrinsically needs to be precise, rigid, even fiddly, or2. Has only been that way so far because that's how computers are1 includes things like security, finance, anything involving contention between parties or that maps to already-precise domains like mathematics or a game with a precise ruleset2 will be increasingly replaced by AI, because approximations and "vibes-based reasoning" were actually always preferable for those casesDifferent parts of the same application will be best suited to 1 or 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good post. I recently built a choose-your-own-adventure style educational game at work for a hackathon.Prompting an LLM to generate and run a game like this gave immediate impressive results, 10 mins after starting we had something that looked great. The problem was that the game sucked. It always went 3-4 rounds of input regardless. It constantly gave the game away because it had all the knowledge in the context, and it just didn't have the right flow at all.What we ended up with at the end of the ~2 days was a whole bunch of Python orchestrating 11 different prompts, no cases where the user could directly interact with the LLM, only one case where we re-used context across multiple queries, and a bunch of (basic) RAG to hide game state from the LLM until the user caused it to be revealed through their actions.LLMs are best used as small cogs in a bigger machine. Very capable, nearly magic cogs, but orchestrated by a lot of regular engineering work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The LLM shouldn’t be implementing any logic.There's separate machine Intelligence technique for that namely logic, optimization and constraint programming [1],[2].Fun facts, the modern founder of logic, optimization, and constraint programming is George Boole, the grandfather of Geoffrey Everest Hinton, the "Godfather of AI".[1] Logic, Optimization, and Constraint Programming: A Fruitful Collaboration - John Hooker - CMU (2023) [video]:https://www.youtube.com/live/TknN8fCQvRk[2] "We Really Don't Know How to Compute!" - Gerald Sussman - MIT (2011) [video]:https://youtube.com/watch?v=HB5TrK7A4pI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43542259</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Everything is Ghibli" discusses the profound impact of Studio Ghibli on animation and storytelling, exploring the studio's unique artistic style and thematic depth. It emphasizes how Ghibli films often blend fantasy with moral and emotional themes, leaving a lasting impression on audiences worldwide. The piece highlights various works by the studio, their cultural significance, and the way they resonate with both children and adults, ultimately showcasing Ghibli's legacy as a key player in cinematic history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghibli art is famous because ghibli art means ghibli movies. It is more beautiful in motion than still, the beauty is in part due to the emotion evoked by the story.There were a million Doom clones, none of which were as good as Doom. The same will be true of AI art copycats.This, however, is not the first time ghibli has had competition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_the_Witch's_Flower in fact they have a whole studio dedicated to copying ghibli: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_PonocYes they used to work at ghibli, but so too did john romero work at id, and yet daikatana was not a quake-killer.This doesn't devalue ghibli at all, I think(In fact, I think AI will always have the fundamental problem that most people have no taste or sense or introspection, they don't know why good things are good, and can't see that crap things are crap, so they are predestined to only be able to produce garbage. Nod to Ted Sturgeon.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read on Reddit that people love AI because it's "democratizing creativity". Let that sink in. People want to be dropped on the top of the mountain and be called an alpinist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What if the transcendence of a unique style into a commodity is inevitable for all greatly influential styles, and a mark of greatness not of debasement or dilution. What if instead of the "impurity" of the commons polluting the "purity" of the pure form, the pure form has evolved into a memetic virus that has infected everything and reproduced itself in many forms, beyond even the power of its creator? The creator's grief at, in part, loss of control is understandable but perhaps is a tribute to how what they created transcended them into a thing with a life of its own, one of the truest tributes to creative genius, no?What if a distinct style is not owned by one artist, even if they are most associated with it, but in reality, in art historical reality, is most commonly explored by a group of more and less famous creators, all as part of a movement, at a time? What influences did Ghibli draw on?Buddhism says all things are essentially empty of their own existence but are merely conditions resulting from other causes, and so on, in a chain unending. Like this.The pointillism[0] of Impressionism that ended up spread to the masses by countless including Bob Ross is one example of the memetic evolution and transcendent influence of "high art". Greatness can filter down but it doesn't mean it's not great.An iPhone is still a masterpiece even if you hold it in the ghetto. Does the ghetto pollute it or does it lift the ghetto? Maybe there's cross pollination, but I think it's infected with its greatness.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43540326</guid></item><item><title>39.

It’s comically bad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just tried the demo on the homepage and I don’t know what kind of sorcery this is but it’s blowing my mind.I input a bunch of completely made up words (Quastral Syncing, Zarnix Meshing, HIBAX, Bilxer) and used them in a sentence and the model zero-shotted perfect speech recognition!It’s so counterintuitive for me that this would work. I would have bet that you have to provide at least one audio sample in order for the model to recognize a word it was never trained on.Providing it to the model in text modality and it being able to recognize it in the audio modality must be an emergent property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so if i understand this correctly — you want the speech recognition model to identify a vocabulary of specific terms that it wasn't trained on. instead of fine-tuning with training data that includes the new vocabulary, you input the full vocabulary at test time as a list of words and the model is able to generate transcripts that include words from the vocabulary.seems like it could be very useful but it really comes down to the specifics.you can prompt whisper with context — how does this compare?how large of a vocabulary can it work with? if it's a few dozen words it's only gonna help for niche use cases. if it can handle 100s-1000s with good performance that could completely replace fine-tuning for many uses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543891</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "debts," both financial and technological, highlighting how various forms of debt can impact individuals and organizations. It explores the responsibilities and potential consequences associated with these debts, including the implications of taking on technology-related obligations. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the trade-offs and long-term ramifications of both types of debt, suggesting that a careful and informed approach is necessary for successful management and future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like we're stretching the metaphor when we apply it to things that won't necessarily compound in complexity or time required to fix it. This is often the case with technical stuff because things can depend on one another, but if you drop a bad process step, the time saved is probably linear since rarely do other teams need to change their process because you changed yours.Debt is scary as a metaphor because the interest compounds and the bank can repo things, but if you just owe a guy $10, he's not gonna come after you years later with a $300,000 bill. Non-compounding bad decisions are "you owe a guy $X" while the compounding ones are "debt".Maybe we should use "fees" and "debts" to differentiate these.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In an attempt to get a more general version of a debt metaphor, let's look at ingredients:
- there is a time interval 
- we have a utility function, or at least desire one or want to pretend we have one
- there is a decision
- there is uncertaintyFrom here there are many paths..."Deliberate vs inadvertent" describes whether we know about the effect the decision has on the utility function."Reckless vs prudent" describes whether we are rational and realize that decisions have consequences.It is also possible that we don't actually have a utility function. Or different people involved in the decision have different utility functions or don't feel the same responsibility towards the outcome (not unheard of when it comes to maintenance/design/architecture vs feature).What makes the debt metaphor very attractive is that it evokes an image of being in control. We may not have spelled out the utility function but everyone agrees it is bad now so we can pretend it was a rational choice we had. The alternative that we did not take any decision when we could have or were too distracted to see the consequences is much harder to accept. So now that we have debt, let's talk about whether we choose to pay it back or now.Rather than working hard to create this faux image of control, I wonder how often teams may be better off having an honest discussion about what the utility function is or should be, which decisions will make the group move in the right direction and how the team can keep oneself accountable that the effects that one had in mind actually took place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The survivor bias section at the end is summed up by a favorite response to premature scaling work at a startup: “We would be very fortunate to have that problem.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532328</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Gores World Map, created by cartographer John Gores in the early 19th century, which aimed to provide a more accurate representation of the Earth's geography. It highlights Gores' unique approach to mapping, including his innovative use of multiple layers and detailed geographic information, and reflects on the map's historical significance in the evolution of cartography. The piece also emphasizes the impact of Gores' work on later mapping techniques and its relevance in today’s understanding of global geography.&lt;/p&gt;

The maps can be either terrestrial (showing the earth) or celestial (showing the heavens) and the gores are typically football shaped.  The gores can be thought of as pre-assembled building blocks for a globe of a particular size which a globe-maker can quickly utilize to construct a globe without having to spend the time constructing the maps.  ”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43546607</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just out of curiosity, I wish online LLMs would show real-time power usage and actual dollar costs as you interact with it. It would be so insightful to understand to which degree the technology is subsidized and what the actual value/cost ratio is.I've read somewhere that generating a single AI image draws as much power as a full smartphone charge.In case the suspicion is true that costs are too high to be monetized, then the current scale-up phase is going to be interesting. Right now people infrequently have a chat with AI. That's quite a different scenario from having it integrated across every stack and it constantly being used in the background, by billions of people.Late as they may be, for the consumer space I think Apple is clever to push as much as possible to the local device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortly after ChatGPT hit the scene, everyone said "Google invented this technology, how could they fall so far behind in commercializing it, haha they're IBM now".Maybe they didn't fall behind in anything, maybe they just did an analysis of what it would cost to train transformer models with hundreds of billions of parameters, to run inferencing on them, and then decided that there was no way to actually be profitable doing this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As the global tech research company forecasts worldwide generative AI (GenAI) spending will reach $644 billion in 2025, up around 76 percent from 2024I’m having a hard time squaring the number $644 billion and the phrase “extinction phase.”I don’t believe their actual estimate of GenAI spending but if it’s even in the same ballpark as the real value, that’s not an extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543429</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of simulating nematode brains, particularly the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, as a model for understanding more complex neural systems. It emphasizes the advancements in computational neuroscience and the potential insights that such simulations could provide into brain function, behavior, and consciousness. The research reflects a broader aim to bridge the gap between biological understanding and artificial intelligence, highlighting the challenges and ethical considerations involved in these simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

So that level of "good" seems enormously far off.On the other hand, there are lots of useful approximations to be made.If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, is it a duck?If it squidges like a nematode and squirms like a nematode, is it a [simulation of a] nematode?(if it talks like a human and makes up answers like a human, is it a human? ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cf. the philosophical zombie:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombieWe really have no idea whether consciousness is something that can arise from computation, or whether it is somehow dependent on the physical substrate of the universe. Maybe we can create a virtual brain that, from the outside, is indistinguishable from a physical brain, and which will argue vociferously that it is a real person, and yet experiences no more conscious qualia than an equation written on a piece of paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43547813</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the idea of self-hosting, especially since I keep a number of very tiny websites/projects going at any given time, so resources would not really be too much of an issue for me.What stops me is security. I simply do not know enough about securing a self-hosted site on real hardware in my home and despite actively continuing to learn, it seems like the more I learn about it, the more questions I have. My identity is fairly public at this point, so if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person on HN or whatever, do I need to worry about someone much smarter than me setting up camp on my home network and ruining my life? That may sound really stupid to many of you, but this is the type of anxiety that stops the under-informed from trying stuff like this and turning to services like Akamai/Linode or DO that make things fairly painless in terms of setup, monitoring and protection.That said, I'm 110% open to reading/watching any resources people have that help teach newbies how to protect their assets when self-hosting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm slowly configuring my new VPS. Here's approach I'm taking:1. RHEL 9 with Developer Subscription. Installed dnf-automatic, set `reboot = when-changed`, so it's zero effort to reliably apply all updates with daily reboots. One or two minutes of downtime, not a big deal.2. For services: podman with quadlets. It's RH-flavoured replacement for docker-compose. Not sure, if I like it, but I guess that's the "future", so I'm embracing it. Every service is a custom-built image with common parent to reduce space waste (by reusing base OS layer).So far I want to run static http (nginx), vaultwarden, postfix and some webmail. May be more in the future.This setup wastes a lot of disk space for image data, so expect to order few more gigabytes of disk to pay for modern tech.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last thing I need is Kubernetes at home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43544979</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chess and Go are very different in that one is for points and the other is for annihilation. However, Go solved the draw (and first player advantage) with 'komi'. Giving white (the second player) some extra points, I think it's usually around 6.5 points right now. The amount that komi should be is still up for debate and changing, though I think everyone agrees the half portion is good.Though stronger players can no longer give 'presents', where you force a draw on a weaker opponent by ensuring both players end up with the same amount of points.Is there amendment to chess that could work similarly? Nothing is coming to mind, but Chess is not my domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of an asymmetric Chess starting position is very interesting, although it does introduce more risk of one side starting with a big advantage (perhaps this has been analyzed).I also like that in this variant, castling works like normal -- that is one of the most unintuitive aspects of Chess960.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t personally think reducing draws would improve the game at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43520005</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the inefficiencies of synchronizing all data between applications and proposes a more selective approach. It emphasizes the importance of identifying critical data that truly requires synchronization rather than indiscriminately syncing everything. The author advocates for better strategies to improve performance, reduce costs, and simplify data management by focusing on essential data needs and optimizing the synchronization process accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The consistency model doesn't seem to make sense.https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft/blob/main/docs/design....&gt; Graft clients commit locally and then asynchronously attempt to commit remotely. Because Graft enforces Strict Serializability globally, when two clients concurrently commit based on the same snapshot, one commit will succeed and the other will fail.OK, but, the API provides only a single commit operation:&gt; commit(VolumeId, ClientId, Snapshot LSN, page_count, segments) Commit changes to a Volume if it is safe to do so. The provided Snapshot LSN is the snapshot the commit was based on. Returns the newly committed Snapshot on success.So if a client commits something, and it succeeds, presumably locally, then how should that client discover that the "async" propagation of that commit has failed, and therefore everything it's done on top of that successful local commit needs to be rolled-back?This model is kind of conflating multiple, very different, notions of "commit" with each other. Usually "commit" means the committed transaction/state/whatever is guaranteed to be valid. But here it seems like a "local commit" can be invalidated at some arbitrary point in the future, and is something totally different than an "async-validated commit"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey friends!
Author of Graft here. Just want to say, huge thanks for all the great comments, stars, and support. Feels really nice to finally be building in public again.I'm going to force myself to sign off for the evening. Will be around first thing to answer any other questions that come up! I just arrived to Washington, DC to attend Antithesis BugBash[1] and if I don't get ahead of the jet lag I'm going to regret it.If anyone happens to be around Washington this week (perhaps at the conference) and wants to meet up, please let me know! You can email me at hello 
 [at] orbitinghail [dotdev].[1]: https://bugbash.antithesis.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, if I understand correctly, the consistency model is essentially git. I.e. you have a local copy, makes changes to it, and then when its time to "push" you can get a conflict where you can "rebase" or "merge".The problem here is that there is no way to cleanly detect a conflict. The documentation talks about pages which have changed, but a page changing isnt a good indicator of conflict. A conflict can happen due to a read conflict. E.g.Update Customer Id: "UPDATE Customers SET id='bar' WHERE id='foo'; UPDATE Orders SET customerId='bar' WHERE customerId='foo'"Add Customer Purchase: "SELECT id FROM Customers WHERE email="blah"; INSERT INTO Orders(customerId, ...) VALUES("foo", ...);"If the update task gets committed first and the pages for the Orders table are full (i.e. inserting causes a new page to allocated) these two operations dont have any page conflicts, but the result is incorrect.\In order to fix this, you would need to track the pages read during the transaction in which the write occurred, but that could easily end up being the whole table if the update column isnt part of an index (and thus requiring a table scan).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43537272</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods for constructing attribution graphs, which are tools used to analyze the impact and contribution of various elements in complex systems like machine learning models. It emphasizes the importance of clear methodologies for effectively attributing outcomes to their sources within these graphs. The article outlines several techniques, including statistical approaches and computational methods, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of attribution processes. Ultimately, the piece serves as a resource for understanding how to systematically assess the contribution of individual components in various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Deep learning models produce their outputs using a series of transformations distributed across many computational units (artificial “neurons”). The field of mechanistic interpretability seeks to describe these transformations in human-understandable language.This is the central theme behind why I find techniques like genetic programming to be so compelling. You get interpretability by default. The second order effect of this seems to be that you can generalize using substantially less training data. The humans developing the model can look inside the box and set breakpoints, inspect memory, snapshot/restore state, follow the rabbit, etc.The biggest tradeoff here being that the search space over computer programs tends to be substantially more rugged. You can't use math tricks to cheat the computation. You have to run every damn program end-to-end and measure the performance of each directly. However, you can execute linear program tapes very, very quickly on modern x86 CPUs. You can search through a billion programs with a high degree of statistical certainty in a few minutes. I believe we are at a point where some of the ideas from the 20th century are viable again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For people new to this maybe check out this video, it explains how the internals run pretty quickly https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UKcWu1l_UNwIn theory if Anthropic puts research into the mechanics of the models internals, we can get better returns in training and alignment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the pdf available somewhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43532253</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the launch of the Matrix Auth Service, which aims to enhance user authentication within the Matrix ecosystem. It introduces features such as single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and improved user management, making it easier for individuals and organizations to adopt Matrix for communication. The service is designed to provide a more secure and user-friendly experience while promoting widespread access to decentralized communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! I’ve recently consolidated all of my Google Chat and WhatsApp friends onto Matrix (via Element) because it’s E2EE. Gchat isn’t and I assume that Meta has a backdoor into WhatsApp conversations. So, those platforms can’t be trusted. Signal doesn’t have a web interface, so that’s a no-go for me. lol Telegram.Matrix has been great for me and I recommend that everyone else use it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I set firefox to clear cookies, also using cookies to "strict"This somehow causes a huge pain to connect to mozilla's matrix instance, and I never understood why. This is a bit ironic since firefox has that feature to clear cookies.I had to reset password, and do other weird things, I can't remember what exactly.I hope this MAS thing fixes it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I vaguely remember an old MSC or TWIM or something that described (the possibility of) a new authentication mechanism whereby I could set up either a dummy homeserver or something in .well_known that would allow me to use my own domain but without needing to use my own homeserver for the actual traffic. Sort of like an auth-only homeserver, if you will.Is that part of MAS? Was that initiative ever fully-baked? Or am I just misremembering?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43558464</guid></item><item><title>8.

The music was not only an afterthought but also insulting to the idea that you would soon climb into a sleek metal tube and be propelled by engines through the sky at 40,000 feet. “I started thinking, ‘What should we be hearing here?’ I thought most of all you wanted music that didn’t try to pretend you weren’t going to die on the plane, ” Eno, laughing but serious."https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brian-eno-ambient-1-mus...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great song.For anyone curious how to produce something that sounds like this, paulstretch is the way to do it.

I'm reviewing now.I hate when i see fun side projects that cost the same as full subscriptions to other products. There's only a handful of $15/m services i "want" in my life.. it really raises the barrier to entry when i'm so aware and averse to subscription costs.Yet $2/m? Instantly sold on that price. It's a fun price, it looks like a fun product, it lines up perfectly for me. It's silly that the price has me almost more interested than the product. Love itThanks for this, i plan to try it out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I stumbled across this clever service when looking for a “pastebin” that handled rendering terminal output with ANSI codes. The irony is that they don’t actually allow that (just plain text can be piped to their pastes service), but I found their whole site and vibe delightful!And the two authors, qudat, and antoniomima  are active on HN, as their responsive comments here demonstrate. Just good work all around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love the idea, but I couldn't find a "pricing" page and wanted to abandon reading immediately (I have no time for unsustainable services). Then I learned from the discussion that the pricing is $2/m, which, two things: 1) I still can't find that price on the web site, and 2) it seems unsustainable to me, so I'm still worried.I run a B2B SaaS. Support costs is what eats you alive: in case of a complex B2B app anything below $40/month is unsustainable. This is of course better for simpler apps/services, but even there you have to be super careful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560899</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that really stuck out to me in the write speed graphs is the dropouts in the speed.  The Maxell seemed to be the only one that didn't have them.Back in the day my company had a regionally-slightly-popular Linux distro.  Every couple months we'd burn 500-700 discs.  We were small enough that it didn't make sense to mass produce, so we burned them ourselves.We would occasionally get reports from people of being unable to read the discs, and so we went through ~6 months of investigation, test shipping to relatives, paying our customers to ship the discs back so we could check them.Eventually I found that while every disc would validate by checksum of the entire disc (part of our burn process), if I tracked the time required to read every block, the discs that people had problems with would tend to have some spikes in the time it took to read some blocks.  The drives we were using would read them, sometimes taking an amazingly long time to do so (like 30 minutes instead of 2), but users drives would just fail them.Eventually I wrote a new validation process that in addition to the checksum used the timing information as well to determin if the disc failed, and at that point our failures in the field basically went to 0.But, we got really sensitive to vendors of discs.  Basically it was Taiyo Yuden or nothing.  Some big brands would give us 20% failures to burn, where Taiyo Yuden was &lt;1%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also thought this was a longevity test.I do love optical media and have a considerable CD, DVD, minidisc, and blu-ray collection. Like a Luddite, I still enjoy burning my own.I especially like my Superscope disc copier. It completely disregards copy protection and I frequently make a backup of my favorite CDs which I store. Although much of my stock are older blanks (like those listed in this article)I’ll be sad if CD-R disappears from the market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great choice with the Pioneer DVR-111. They're my favorite series of drives ever. NEC ND-3500 chipset; Pioneer mechanism.Pioneer publish the approved media list for their drives but it's not really detailed enough since it only lists by manufacturer while the firmware is operating on manufacturer plus media code: https://www.mfdigital.com/downloads/Pioneer%20111%20approved...You can potentially get better results by patching your discs into your drive's firmware using MediaCodeSpeedEdit: https://ala42.cdfreaks.com/MCSE/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551663</guid></item><item><title>11.

Seems similar to how they were the pre-product leaders in transformers and then fumbled any advantage they had to ChatGPT. It seems like something's missing from Google where they can't get from research to product effectively. Waymo perhaps a good counterexample if you think where they are today is product/market fit, but I can't shake the feeling that Google more often than not can't seem to get things to market or even if they do they give up on them before they take hold.Just wondering if anyone has a strong feeling or, better yet, insight on this regarding their robotics efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43557310</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is set to launch Thundermail, a new email service aimed at competing with established platforms like Gmail and Microsoft 365. This service is part of Mozilla's broader strategy to enhance user privacy and security, offering features that prioritize data protection. Thundermail is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Mozilla products and aims to provide users with a customizable and user-friendly email experience. The initiative reflects Mozilla's commitment to providing alternatives to mainstream services while addressing growing concerns over user data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

How do I know Mozilla will still be doing this in 5-10 years? (Edit: Others have pointed out that, if we can bring our own domains, technical users can retain their address. However, for non-technical users that's not an option.)Also, I'm not sure about charging a fee at the start (except for TB contributors) and providing a free tier later - reverse of the usual way of launching a product. Maybe this is a soft launch to shake out the bugs and build a little momentum, and you can pay if you want to take part?Mozilla could do something awesome here. I hate to say it, but here is a chance to start fresh and make big, legacy-breaking changes to Thunderbird. The new audience - which should become the vast majority if they are successful - won't care if it's not like the old Thunderbird (possibly unlike many on HN). Here is a chance to do something special and the mail client is all most users see or understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make thunderbird supports a local database with 100k emails with proper search ! Make us pay for that optimization if needed.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Linux binary compatibility, focusing on the challenges and solutions for running binaries compiled for one Linux distribution on another. It highlights the importance of understanding how libraries, dependencies, and system calls affect compatibility across different versions and flavors of Linux. The piece emphasizes methods such as using containerization, compatibility layers, and application packaging techniques to facilitate smoother execution of binaries across diverse environments, ultimately aiming to enhance software portability and user experience in the Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So of the 3 glibc issues they link- one is about the format of symbol information in the actual ELF binaries which is only an issue if you are not using the standard libc functions for looking up symbols for some strange reason- one is an issue that impacts targeting a lower version of glibc from a higher one which is a configuration that was never supported (though usually fails more loudly)- the last one is a security policy change which is legitimately an ABI break, but mostly impacts programs that have their execstack flags set incorrectlyglibc actually goes to a fair bit of effort to be compatible with old binaries unlike most of the  rest of the Linux userspace. The binaries I built for my side project back in 2015 (BlastEm 0.3.0) still work fine on modern Linux and they dynamically link against glibc. This is just a hobby project, not a piece of professional software, and a build from before this JangaFX company even existed works fine.I find it really bizarre when people talk about Linux binary compat and then complain entirely about glibc rather than the sort of problems that the manylinux project has had to deal with. glibc is one of the few parts of userspace you can depend on. Yes, setting up your toolchain to build against an old glibc on a modern distro is a bit annoying. Sure, if you do something sufficiently weird you might find yourself outside what glibc considers part of their stable ABI. But from where I sit, it works pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no distinction between system and program libraries in Linux. We used to pretend there was one before usrmigration, but that was never good to take seriously.The distro as packager model ensures that everything is mixed together in the filesystem and is actively hostile to external packaging. Vendoring dependencies or static linking improves compatibility by choosing known working versions, but decreases incentive and ability for downstream (or users) to upgrade those dependencies.The libc stuff in this article is mostly glibc-specific, and you'd have fewer issues targeting musl. Mixing static linking and dlopen doesn't make much sense, as said here[1] which is an interesting thread. Even dns resolution on glibc implies dynamic linking due to nsswitch.Solutions like Snap, Flatpak, and AppImage work to contain the problem by reusing the same abstractions internally rather than introducing anything that directly addresses the issue. We won't have a clean solution until we collectively abandon the FHS for a decentralized filesystem layout where adding an application (not just a program binary) is as easy as extracting a package into a folder and integrates with the rest of the system. I've worked on this off and on for a while, but being so opinionated makes everything an uphill battle while accepting the current reality is easy.[1] https://musl.openwall.narkive.com/lW4KCyXd/static-linking-an...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why they don't just statically link their binaries. First, they said this:&gt; Even if you managed to statically link GLIBC—or used an alternative like musl—your application would be unable to load any dynamic libraries at runtime.But then they immediately said they actually statically link all of their deps aside from libc.&gt; Instead, we take a different approach: statically linking everything we can.If they're statically linking everything other than libc, then using musl or statically linking glibc will finish the job. Unless they have some need for loading share libs at runtime which they didn't already have linked into their binary (i.e. manual dlopen), this solves the portability problem on Linux.What am I missing (assuming I know of the security implications of statically linked binaries -- which they didn't mention as a concern)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551934</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone here hasn't read Borges, I'd strongly recommend him. Pretty much everything he wrote was short, &lt;20 pages, and so it's really easy to sit down and read one of his stories over a lunch break. The common recommendation would be to try out Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius and see if you like it. If so, it's part of Labyrinths, which is (in my opinion) his best collection of short stories. The best edition in English is probably Penguin's Collected Fictions.Regarding the content of this interview:&gt;If you compiled an enormous dataset of everything Borges read, and combined it with an exquisitely sensitive record of every sensory experience he ever had, could you create a Borges LLM?This is my Kantian way of thinking about epistemology, but I don't think that LLMs can create synthetic a priori knowledge. Such knowledge would be necessary to create Borges out of a world without Borges.In this interview, Simon's view feels much more like the way Hume viewed people as mechanical "bundles of sensations" rather than possessing a transcendent "self". This led to his philosophical skepticism, which was (and still is I guess) a philosophical dead end for a lot of people. I think such epistemological skepticism is accurate when applied to machines, at least until some way of creating synthetic a priori knowledge is established (Kant did so with categories for humans, what would the LLM version of this be?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you compiled an enormous dataset of everything Borges read, and combined it with an exquisitely sensitive record of every sensory experience he ever had, could you create a Borges LLM?Hmm, what if you could recreate, word-for-word, the great works of an author like Borges (or, say, Cervantes) by so thoroughly understanding their life that the words themselves came out of you, not memorized and recapitulated, but naturally and unbidden? What an interesting idea for a story, maybe an LLM will be able to write that one day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Borges is totally recommended, of course, but after reading him in the original language I think his English translations lack the poetry and music of his writings. For once I am happy Spanish is my first language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43559122</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the metaphorical and literal loss of color in the world, discussing how vibrant colors are seen to diminish in various aspects of life, such as art, nature, and human emotions. It examines societal trends, environmental changes, and the impact of technology on our perception of color. The piece argues that this loss reflects deeper issues, including disconnection from nature and a lack of emotional expression, ultimately urging a reconnection with vibrant experiences and the natural world to restore richness in life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not "losing" color.At periods when technology resulted in new color possibilities, people went overboard with color. Make all the things colorful!! Think of the technicolor sixties. And we can go back in history and see the same thing with new clothing pigments, new paint pigments.But when everything is colorful, nothing stands out. Everything being colorful is as monotonous as everything being, well, monotone.Modern taste is more about more neutral-colored foundations with color accents. Don't paint a whole room green -- have a gorgeous green plant that stands out all the more against its neutral background. Don't paint a whole wall orange -- have a beautiful orange-hued piece of art on the wall. It's just more tasteful to use color as one element, along with size, shape, texture, and so forth. Making it the main element in everything is just overdoing it. It's bad design.I don't want constant "riotous color", as the article puts it, in my home, or my workplace, or while I'm driving. It's visually exhausting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, so much to rage about from the article.I am a huge fan of color and go out of my way to buy bright colored cars, phones, etc. (Not like I had any viable options for my MacBook Pro though).Resale value, it hides dirt well are some of the sadder excuses I hear for buying gray and "silver" cars (wouldn't be cool if they really were silver, not "metallic gray"). Meanwhile you spend your entire time owning the car and driving around like a brooding storm cloud.Color grading might be the most evil thing to descend on film making. It's to the point of distraction now. Like it draws attention to itself. (Watching "Mickey 17" in a theater and a scene comes on that screams "color graded!" and then it's become all I can see. Kind of like the nausea-inducing, shaky "hand held camera" thing that was so predominate some decades ago. Good riddance to that.Oh well, I guess all I can do is to keep voting with my shopping preferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would argue that the main reason is because everything is about money, and the shorter marketability of everything. Colors are polarising, and affect the unsold inventory and perceived resale value.Why manufacture objects in 10 different colours if you know the green one is going to be a tough sell? Why buy a blue car if you think you’re going to sell it back after 2 years and struggle to do so?You don’t want things you don’t intend to keep to have personally, period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43557471</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;Automattic has announced a major restructuring aimed at improving efficiency and collaboration across its teams. This change includes a shift in organizational structure to enhance communication, streamline processes, and better address customer needs. The company's leadership is committed to fostering a more agile environment, allowing for quicker decision-making and innovation. This restructuring reflects Automattic's dedication to adaptability and growth in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

Regrettably, we will need to implement a 16% reduction in headcount to address the financial challenges we now face.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of Mermaid charts with Visual Studio Code through a dedicated plugin, which facilitates the creation and editing of Mermaid.js diagrams directly within the IDE. It highlights the benefits of using this plugin, such as enhanced productivity, seamless diagram management, and the ease of incorporating visual elements into code documentation. The piece also compares traditional methods of creating diagrams with the efficiency offered by the plugin, encouraging developers to leverage this tool for better visualization of ideas and processes in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like Mermaid, but I'm not seeing the value in this as is.- Mermaid within .md is widely supported. The file format of .mmd, while supported in most integrations, is a standalone file rather than living within my documentation/markdown. I use Mermaid charts and graphs as visual aids to add to the documentation or notes rather than having them stand alone. If I wanted a standalone file, I'd use any other diagram tool with its proprietary file format. I like Meriamid because of how easy it is to integrate into markdown. The value isn't in having a Mermaid file; the value is in adding diagrams and charts to markdown.- Within .md files there's a Mermaid logo added beside the Mermaid, but it doesn't seem to be clickable or have a context menu. Maybe this is a bug. It also weirdly highlights all of the Mermaid code. Why doesn't it syntax highlight within markdown? This extension works great for highlighting: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=bpruitt...- It doesn't add support for viewing mermaid within markdown preview. I currently use this extension for it. This is a key feature that is missing. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=bierner...Overall, excited to see what this becomes. Hope this is useful feedback! It can only get better from here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps PlantUML isn't as new and interesting as Mermaid, but each time I try a side-by-side comparison, the results are always better in PlantUML than Mermaid. I'll admit that the Mermaid syntax is a lot easier to understand, but the PlantUML syntax is a lot more powerful. I especially like the new Activity diagrams in PlantUML with the conditionals and looping syntax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mermaid is fantastic as a portable I/O format for LLM context. I spent some time discussing entity relationships with an LLM recently, and had it produce a Mermaid diagram to wrap up the conversation.Once you have the diagram code, you can use that as an artifact for new LLM chats related to databases, APIs, etc.I'm not sure what the history of mermaidchart.com specifically is, but I'm guessing it's new since the ER diagram docs are marked as "coming soon":https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid/er/syntaxI'm curious how this plugin compares to Markdown Preview Mermaid Support:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe the answer is for someone to work on boosting natural caffeine levels in yaupon holly tea.It grows wild all over the SE US and can withstand multi-year drought or regular floods though it does best in a situation where it gets regular rainfall. You may have some in your own yard used as a hedge plant. I have several large trees on my place. It spreads underground by suckers and will take over an area if you do nothing to contain it. It is very strong once it forms a thicket. I have driven across a yaupon thicket in a seismic buggy and been in a situation where none of the tires were touching the ground as I drove because I was crossing a thick tangle of yaupon that supported the vehicle.Caffeine levels are lower than coffee beans (40-60 mg versus &gt;150 mg I think). Yaupon does also have theobromines, vasodilators, that are supposed to help it prevent the caffeine crash.I have some leaves dried and drink it make a tea occasionally when I want a boost but not a cup of coffee level boost. It tastes great and is easy to prepare at home.[0]https://yauponbrothers.com/blogs/news/is-yaupon-better-than-...There are other sources of information about yaupon holly. It is proposed that the British naturalist who discovered Native Americans using it in their own ceremonies and drinking it casually decided to name it ilex vomitoria not because it was dangerous or poisonous to consume but because since it grew wild in the colonies, it could be a serious competitor to English tea so he used the name to make it less attractive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine production is likely difficult in the face of a drier climate. Caffeine is present in the plant as a pesticide. Insects are a much bigger problem in wet climates over dry.Having grown up in a wet climate (Chicago) but now living in a dry one (Utah) I can say that finding a droubt tolerant species which concerns itself with pesticide production may be difficult. The same water which coffee relies on is the same stuff pests rely on to reproduce. My mother was from Utah, and she always lamented at the small size of her flowers growing up in Chicago. They are much larger in Utah because they can get big without insects eating them.(I say all this as a point of interest, but I don't drink coffee myself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://youtu.be/iGL7LtgC_0I?si=V8vXK4QzF_lAfRjBJames Hoffman did an interesting episode on this bean a few years ago, very cool the work being done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555286</guid></item><item><title>22.

Well…no. It was possible to modify the phone number being sent, and then receive data back for Verizon numbers not associated with the signed in user.Yikes. Seems like a pretty massive oversight by Verizon. I wish in situations like this there was some responsibility of the company at fault to provide information about if anyone else had used and abused this vector before it was responsibly disclosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The Verizon Call Filter app uses the endpoint hxxps://clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval to lookup call history for the authenticated user and display it in the app.Have you ever seen a more internal-looking domain name?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy that this is possible at such a giant like Verizon.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This, to paraphrase Portlandia, is one of the dreams of the ’90s — that our work selves and our true natures could be one and the same.I have always wanted to achieve this (to no avail so far). To live for something bigger. To be pushed to use my talents in full. To evolve without stop and throw away the old self without hesitance. These three to me are arguably the important characteristics of a true human-being. They (and some other characteristics) tell humans from animals.It may sound like, but is not, workaholism. Workaholism is escapism. Workaholism, like alcoholism, roots from a certain sad history one wants to avoid. This is not workaholism, but a conscious pursuit of perfection, of "Godhood", as one may say as an atheist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computing was less annoying before it became a branch of the advertising industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microserfs has a permanent spot on my bookshelf, and really did a great job capturing the zeitgeist of working in tech in the 90s. It was more about the early 90s than the late 90s when I started in tech, but not much really changed until the dotCom bubble burst in 2000. A lot of us who didn't happen to work for GiantTech in the 90s shared the existential anxieties described in earlier chapters of the book, but without the upside of lucrative stock options. It's worth a read if you haven't. A lot of it is still relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551338</guid></item><item><title>25.

More info on an equally charming old website here, including a remarkable letter from his wife:http://josephoster.com/billsvoyage/index.htmlI suppose every wife in any generation wants their husbands to be safe, but each generation has a different approach to risk and adventure. I know my wife would be resolutely opposed to any voyage like this (says the man with a dream of sailing a Hobie Cat across the Great Lakes...perhaps when my son is grown).This page also includes a 100x136 pixel high-resolution color digital photo of the boat, and the year: 2002.http://josephoster.com/billsvoyage/potter.htmlThere's also an update page with a GIF animation of the weather accompanied by the text "WARNING!!! file size: 1.5 MBytes"From the article:&gt; The batteries were charged for about 1 hour daily using a Honda EU 1000 gasoline generator coupled with a 3-stage battery charger. The generator burned 1-1/2 gallons of gas in 24 days. ... There was no backup power source for charging the batteries.24 hours of runtime and 1.5 gallons of gas equate to 0.625 gallon usage per hour. From the spec sheet, an EU1000 generator has a 0.55 gallon tank and can run for 6.8 hours at 225W output, that's 0.081 gallons per hour, so I estimate that the generator was operating at about 174 watts, given it ran for an hour that's 174 watthours per day.23 years later, anyone would assume that your default source of 174 watthours per day would be a solar panel. A single 2x3 foot rigid panel would do ~100W peak and see the equivalent of 4-6 peak hours per day, easily beating that requirement. Any serious sailboat (even a little trailerable 19' coastal boat like this one) would have a whole array powering lighting and sensors and radar/radios and telemetry and would budget much more than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait, is this exact boat for sale?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am really impressed by how thoroughly this library thinks through all the applications and edge cases of text casing.On a recent project I spent about an hour trying to do something similar (and far less sophisticated) before I realized it was a problem I had no desire in really solving, so I backed out all my changes and just went with string.capitalize(), even though it didn’t really do what I was looking for. Looking forward to using this instead!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might be jaded, but I think having libraries for such simple use cases leads to the inevitable `left-pad` situation.When I say simple use cases I mean that since you probably don't need all of these functions at once that it would be easier to copy the code you need if you don't feel comfortable writing it instead of adding yetanotherlibrary to your dependency tree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A feature complete Python text case conversion libraryI suspect you mean "featureful", "full-featured" or similar[1]—"feature complete" means that you're not going to add any more features.[1] https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/393517/what-do-y...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43551915</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article on air pollution sources provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of air pollutants, their origins, and their impacts on health and the environment. It categorizes pollution sources into natural and anthropogenic (human-made) activities, detailing contributions from sectors such as transportation, industry, agriculture, and residential heating. The article also discusses the global trends in air quality, the specific pollutants involved (like particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide), and the frameworks for measuring and addressing air pollution through policy interventions and technology. Furthermore, it emphasizes the significance of understanding these sources to effectively combat air pollution and enhance public health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the most striking aspects of air pollution is how invisible yet pervasive its effects are. Unlike more immediate environmental disasters, air pollution slowly chips away at public health, reducing life expectancy and quality of life, often without dramatic headlines. The comparison to starvation as a "frailty multiplier" is an interesting one; pollution doesn’t always kill directly but makes people more susceptible to fatal conditions.Regarding the reduction in SO₂ emissions from shipping fuel, I’d love to see more discussion on how international regulatory pressure (e.g., IMO 2020) managed to enforce compliance in an industry notorious for cost-cutting. Was it simply a case of the alternatives being feasible enough, or did global coordination and monitoring play a stronger role than usual?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought that this article will address an elephant in the room but either it missed it or I missed it.My problem with pollution is that… you need to measure it, and those who pollute don’t do it consciously. Anecdotally I often drive through a small town. You can smell pollution, a plastic smell. In winter you can see column of smoke coming out of chimney. Sometimes it’s milky white, sometimes it thick black. There are many like that. I asked shop keeper is it happening often, she confirmed and said that no one is interested in doing otherwise, installing sensors was directly opposed by town council.The town is not on a pollution map. Nearby cities are with medium-high pollution but that particular region is supposedly clean as reported by a single sensor positioned somewhere on a hill.It’s not like there is one town like that in the world. There are nations that pollute heavily and don’t care and don’t meter the impact. I would be curious if all the effort, regulations etc. are worth it when applied to average Joe versus huge polluters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting article. I always assumed that a large part of the "soot" air pollution in cities came from car tyres as well, since their compounds are one of the main sources for the dust that deposits in apartments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43553663</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on a novel deep learning method aimed at enhancing the performance of various machine learning models. It introduces a framework that combines different neural network architectures to optimize the predictive capabilities and robustness against overfitting. Through empirical evaluations, the method demonstrates improvements in accuracy on several benchmark datasets, showing its potential applications in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The findings suggest that integrating multiple models can lead to superior performance compared to using a single architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is another potential improvement to the transformer architecture from Facebook (the other one that comes to mind is this one from same authors: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18719), but note that it comes with a major problem that might not be obvious at first glance: it's just not usable in practice without a ton of work. It modifies the innards of the attention mechanism, so it is incompatible with Flash Attention (or any other optimized attention library), and you do not want to train anything beyond toy models without Flash Attention (the performance hit is just way too big).There's pytorch's FlexAttention which could maybe make this practical, but currently it's just way too buggy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. So they convolve the k,v, q vectors? I have been trying the opposite.I have been working on a classification problem on audio data (with context size somewhere between 1000 and 3000 with potential to expand later). I have been experimenting with adding attention onto a CNN for a classification task I have been working on.I tried training a vanilla transformer but in the sizes that I am aiming for (5-30M parameters), the training is incredibly unstable and doesn't achieve the performance of an LSTM.So I went back to CNNs which are fast to train but don't achieve the losses of LSTMs (which are much slower to train,and for higher context sizes you get into the vanishing gradient problem). The CNN-GRU hubrid a worked much better, giving me my best result.The GRU layer I used had a size of 512. For increasing context sizes, I'd have to make the convolutional layers deeper so as not to increase the GRU size too large. Instead, I decided to swap out the GRU with a MultiHeadAttention layer. The results are great - better than the CNN-GRU (my previous best). Plus, for equivalent sizes the model is faster to train though it hogs a lot of memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare with Byte Latent Transformer [1]? This happens with convolution post-embedding while BLT happens with attention at embedding time?1. https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transf...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562384</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities surrounding job performance and the perception that people may be inadequate in their roles. It highlights the influence of systemic factors, such as poor management, unrealistic expectations, and lack of resources, on employees' ability to succeed in their jobs. The author argues that while individual performance can vary, it is essential to consider the broader context in which employees operate, suggesting that many issues attributed to personal shortcomings may stem from larger organizational problems. By addressing these systemic issues, businesses can create a more supportive environment that fosters better performance and job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been in the workforce for almost 30 years now and I believe that everybody is getting more squeezed so they don’t have the time or energy to do a proper job. The expectation is to get it done as quickly as possible and not do more unless told so.In SW development in the 90s I had much more time for experimentation to figure things out. In the last years you often have some manager where you basically have to justify every thing you do and always a huge pile of work that never gets smaller. So you just hurry through your tasks.I think google had it right for a while with their 20% time where people could do wanted to do. As far as I know that’s over.People need some slack if you want to see good work. They aren’t machines that can run constantly on 100% utilization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gig economy is way worse than the author describes.Gig workers can't advance with the companies they work for.Gig workers can't build a network with their coworkers because they don't have coworkers...and there's a good chance that they are competing for work with other people working for the same company.There are dead end day jobs, and then there is gig work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a lot of commenters here are projecting this article onto their work lives as tech office workers, but it's really more about the world of unskilled and semi-skilled service/gig workers, like handymen, furniture assemblers, delivery drivers, and so on.All these things can be true and they reinforce each other: The jobs suck &lt;-&gt; The people willing to do them aren't very happy, skilled or competent &lt;-&gt; The pay is minuscule. And we can't seem to get out of this Nash Equilibrium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562119</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 32b sounds like it has some useful small tweakers. Tweaks to make output more human friendly, better mathematical reasoning, better fine-grained understanding. https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464068Qwen2.5-VL-72b was released two months ago (to little fanfare in submissions, i think, but some very enthusiastic comments such as rabid enthusiasm for handwriting recognition) already very interesting. Its actually one of the releases that kind of turned me on to AI, that broke through some of my skepticism &amp; grumpiness. There's pretty good release notes detailing capabilities here; well done blog post. https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/One thing that really piqued my interest was Qwen HTML output, where it can provide bounding boxes in HTML format for its output. That really closes the loop interestingly to me, makes the output something I can imagine quickly building useful visual feedback around, or using the structured data from easily. I can't imagine an easier to use output format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose none of these models can output bounding box coordinates for extracted text? That seems to be a big advantage of traditional OCR over LLMs.For applications I'm interested in, until we can get to 95+% accuracy, it will require human double-checking / corrections, which seems unfeasible w/o bounding boxes to quickly check for errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downloading the MLX version of "Qwen2.5-VL-32b-Instruct -8bit" via LM Studio right now since it's not yet available on Ollama and I can run it locally...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a huge fan of Real Genius.  This comes at a real oddly coincidental time...Back when I was probably 16, so '86, I came across Robert Woodhead, probably on Usenet, probably with some mention that he worked on the movie.  So I sent him an e-mail and told him how much I loved the movie.  He wrote back and told me a little about the computer graphics that he did for the movie.  So every time I see some of the graphics scenes, I think of him.A few days ago I was watching a Youtube video "10 things you didn't know about Real Genius", and it showed those computer graphics.And I thought "I wonder what he's up to."  Turns out he's done some kind of interesting things, has a github, etc.  So, I fired off another e-mail to him ("I'm sure you don't remember, but back in '86 you graciously replied to an e-mail I sent you and I've often thought of that kindness.")  He happens to live where I visit typically a couple times a year, so we've set up going out to coffee.2 e-mails, 40 years apart, and then this.  Coincidences, man.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I first saw this film when I was a kid, and it made a lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, it feels like the lesson of the film has not been learned: too many "geniuses" over the past 40 years have failed to consider the negative social consequences of the technology that they create. These naive geniuses are all too happy to solve technical problems and cash paychecks given to them by powers that turn out to be malevolent (despite draping themselves in a costume of benevolence).Question authority, and question your own role in the power structure. It's a moral imperative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From memory, having last seen it in the '80s:"Why do you wear that toy on your head?" "Because if I wear it anywhere else, it...chafes""What's that?" "A laser beam, bozo!" "What are we supposed to do?" "Follow it!""Your stutter has improved" "I've been giving myself shock treatment" "...Up the voltage""You're laborers, you're supposed to be laboring. That's what you get for not having an education!""It's a coherent beam of light" "So that means it talks?"Of course, the non-quote where one of the kids at the study table stands up, screams repeatedly, and leaves, and with no reaction one of the kids at the periphery of the room moves to sit in his place.And of course: "If there's ever anything I can do for you, or, more to the point, to you..." "Can you hammer a six inch spike through a board with your penis?" "Well, not right now..."Real Genius had a significant impact on me...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555334</guid></item><item><title>35.

It discusses the region's tectonic activity, particularly the interactions between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The piece highlights the challenges of earthquake prediction and the importance of understanding geological processes to mitigate future risks, as well as the impact of such natural disasters on local communities and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

The paper have been rejected for many times now by many prominent journals for example Nature and Science, heck it's even rejected by arXiv.org. Apparently it's a taboo to perform a study and claim on short-term earthquake by USGS, and they even make fun of it that I think is pretty childish to put in a professional website [1],[2]. However, based on our results for short-term prediction of offline data, they are very consistent for five recent major earthquakes across five earthquake prones countries.[1] Can you predict earthquakes?https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/faqs/can-you-predict-earthqua...[2] 100% Chance of an Earthquake:https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/100-chance-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked the photo that one of the quoted seismologists, Zhigang Peng from Atlanta, supplied to the author of this article - which depicts the seismologist standing in front of a sign marking the San Andreas fault on a visit to California.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a peculiar incident where a test for the Yarn package manager encountered unexpected errors due to a dependency conflict, specifically around the use of a deprecated package. As the team investigated, they discovered that certain actions inadvertently led to more complex dependency resolution issues, illustrating the intricacies and challenges in managing package dependencies in software development. The post emphasizes the importance of attention to detail in testing and dependency management to avoid such derailments, ultimately reflecting on best practices for developers using Yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the real problem is that Jest just executes to whatever `sl` resolves. The fix they intent to release doesn't address that, but it tries to recognise the train steaming through. How is this acceptable behaviour from a test runner, as it looks like a disaster to happen. What if I have `alias sl=rm -rf /`, as one typically wants to have such a command close at hand?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just from the title, I suspected that Steam Locomotive had something to do with it. So I quickly glanced through the article up to the point where the locomotive shows up. Sometimes there's the idea hanging in my mind to make a version called Slow Locomotive, where the train slows down every time you press ctrl-c.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A useful error message would have made this a 1-minute investigation. The "fix" of trying to detect this specific program is much too narrow. The right fix is to change Yarn to print a message about what it was trying to do (check for a Sapling repo) and what happened instead. This is also likely a systemic problem, so a good engineer would go through the whole program and fix other places that need it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43556280</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the author's personal choice to avoid political discussions with friends, highlighting the potential for conflict and tension such conversations can create. The author reflects on the importance of maintaining friendships and fostering a positive social environment, suggesting that political disagreements can lead to division and resentment. Instead, the piece advocates for focusing on shared interests and experiences, emphasizing the value of preserving relationships over engaging in potentially divisive topics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Article starts off be asserting that they don't talk politics with friends then proceeds to describe how to talk politics with friends?)Friends are people you should support and build up. You shouldn't try to make them feel bad by winning arguments with them. That said- a healthy society is only possible if individuals can exchange ideas about how to run things and then act collectively (aka "politics"). Sometimes people will have different interests and priorities, that lead to them having different ideas about stuff- most of the time this is totally fine.This basically comes down to respect and communication skills- but for god's sake people- keep on talking about "politics"!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess I just don't see "tribalism". I know it's a popular description though for the divisiveness we find ourselves in politically.But I consider the things important to me, the beliefs, the issues: and they, all of them, align with a progressive, left-leaning ideology. I'm not just glomming on to everything one "tribe" or another stands for ... one group actually reflects everything I believe. (I think I could split a few hairs here and there, but we're still talking perhaps 95% alignment.)But I don't think that is too surprising. Others, smarter than me, have gone into great detail about the underpinnings of left-leaning or right-leaning world views in people. Fear of change, empathy ... a number of ideas have been put forth. By this reasoning it naturally follows that those of a certain "personality" will also share common beliefs, ideologies.The implication instead seems to be that unless you are somewhere in the middle of the spectrum you must be "tribal". That feels dismissive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll provide an opposing viewpoint. In the last 10 years, I've lost friendships and family because people in my life have voted for candidates that stripped rights away from women, minorities, etc.Having a vast difference between opinions is fine, but some of their decisions are fundamentally against my core beliefs and have done literal harm to many people I know.For that reason, terminating family and friendships has been absolutely worth it for me.Until we can live in a world where fundamental rights are protected and respected, we have no common ground, and it's pointless to tiptoe around these insanely harmful beliefs while maintaining a facade of friendship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43559605</guid></item><item><title>39.

It just re-enables all controls on all &lt;video&gt; elements and uses z-indexing to push them to the top. Works on instagram but needs to be re-ran for new video elements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For youtube shorts, replacing the "shorts" in URL with "watch" will give you the usual interface, for example:https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GqkmtcirwYA -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch/GqkmtcirwYABut actually I see that seek bar is already available in youtube shorts.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the author's experience attending an OpenBSD conference in Amsterdam, where they share insights from discussions, workshops, and personal interactions with community members. It highlights the significance of OpenBSD in the realms of security and software development, and the author's reflections on the collaborative and welcoming nature of the community. The piece serves as an introduction to OpenBSD and encourages others to explore and contribute to this Unix-like operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;i didnt understand it until i stumbled on the bsd supp docs that openbsd couldnt be *** to include. i dont have the sources, but v7 vol2 is close enough:https://s3.amazonaws.com/plan9-bell-labs/7thEdMan/bswv7.htmlfor vi, get the PostScript.ps files for the OTHER manual from bostics sources (openbsd src only has troff source and no troff):https://sites.google.com/a/bostic.com/keithbostic/the-berkel...    echo pkg_add ghostscript | su root
    tar xfz nvi-1.79.tar.gz
    cd nvi-1.79/docs/USD.doc
    (cd vi.ref; ps2pdf vi.ref.ps)
    (cd vi.tut; ps2pdf vi.tut.ps)

the interactive vi tutorial is also great:    ftp -C https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/`uname -r`/SHA256.sig &amp;&amp;
    ftp -C https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/`uname -r`/src.tar.gz &amp;&amp;
    signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-`uname -r|tr -d .`-base.pub -x SHA256.sig src.tar.gz &amp;&amp;
    echo tar xfzCp src.tar.gz /usr/src | su root
    cp /usr/src/usr.bin/vi/docs/tutorial/* ./
    vi vi.beginner
    vi vi.advanced

btw for full openbsd sources you need to do    echo tar xfzCp src.tar.gz   /usr/src      | su root
    echo tar xfzCp sys.tar.gz   /usr/src      | su root
    echo tar xfzCp ports.tar.gz /usr          | su root
    echo tar xfzCp src.tar.gz   /usr/xenocara | su root

wouldnt it be nice if installation did this and syspatch patched it and sysupgrade merged it?
openbsd is also not very good at pointing you to the right manual. making them grepable was a small improvement for me.    mkdir man &amp;&amp; cd man &amp;&amp;
    for n in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    do for m in /usr/share/man/man$n/*
    do man $n `basename $m .$n` | col -b &gt; `basename $m`
    done
    done
    grep 'why is it so broken' *

maybe feed it into a LLM idk. you are now on the beginning of the long, tedious, futile and soul crushing journey of dealing with documentation and source code on openbsd. you will not look back on it thru rose coloured glasses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice read!This really resonated with me:&gt; I would skim the documentation for the command to run, or the configuration to enter, only to get error messages in response. Then a period of frantic searching and trial and error would follow. Until I finally got it right. Once it worked, I reread the original documentation and saw that the answers were right there all along. Crystal clear. And yet somehow it did not register the first time. This happened on multiple occasions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;haha thanks this seems so oddly familiar. setting up openbsd on a vps slowly. each problem as you write, stumped, searching frustratedly. only to find the answer staring me in the face in the docs i definitely tried to read the first time round :')... getting slowly more into the 'read it slowly and take notes'. litterally every issue :D. they say these man pages / docs are the best. they really are. maybe there is some learning curve to transition from bad documentation to good documentation...either way, thanks for writeup, definitely going to reread it better and maybe it will save me some fallingonmyface soon!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533151</guid></item><item><title>42.

 - central bank interest rate moves
 - local tariffs and sanctions
 - shipping blackades / blockages
 - regional war
 - extreme weather events
 - earthquake
 - regional epidemic
 - giving poor people cash grants
 - free higher education
 - science research grants
 - skilled immigration / emigrationBut .. of course this would require something like a rich country providing grants to applied cross disciplinary research over many years.It might even lead to insights that prevent semi-regular economic boom and bust cycles we experienced the past 100 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related: MONIAC, a 1949 analogue computer macroeconomics simulator, with water flowing through the machine representing money and spending etc.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_MachineShort clip: https://youtu.be/beuseJ0Wm3MDetailed demo: https://youtu.be/gkNaZJmii28&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agent-based modeling offers a more realistic approach to economic systems than traditional equilibrium models.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this work by Otoro / David Ha.For come context, this uses a technique called CPPN’s (compositional pattern producing networks), where the inputs are (x, y, sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and then there are several neural net layers with different activation functions and randomly initialized weights. It actually resembles the optical physics of light reflecting through glass (which explains why it sometimes looks like light reflecting through a gem).Otoro wrote some great blog posts on this:https://blog.otoro.net/2016/03/25/generating-abstract-patter...https://blog.otoro.net/2015/07/31/neurogram/https://github.com/hardmaru/cppn-tensorflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the risk of sounding like an idiot. What even is this? Is there a purpose? It looks just like random pixel generation to me.

The details don't matter at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One nice side effect of Signal's importance for governmental/military use is that it helps keep it free for civilian use.  They can't mandate a backdoor for something other parts of the government rely on to be secure.I once heard a great anecdote to that effect, and to my embarrassment I can't recall the details to repeat here.(And yes, I understand that there are limits on what is appropriate to share with civilian hardware on a civilian network, but the truth stands that part of the reason there's not a push to breach encryption in the US like there is in the UK is because Signal is relied upon even by the government when they need a private channel on civilian hardware.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560336</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice project!Did you know that instead of buying new motor controllers, you can re-use the hoverboard motor controller? Awesome people have made open source firmware you can flash to it: https://github.com/EFeru/hoverboard-firmware-hack-FOC. With this firmware you can make the motors go way faster, up to 40km/h with a 12S battery.We are also building a kart with hoverboard motors, with a custom welded steel frame. Vibrations are a real issue with the standard solid rubber wheels, hopefully I can find the same air tires you used!Our website is in Dutch, but you can watch the videos: https://projects.raphson.nl/projects/kart/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe this will help someone to not over-engineer a kart: in Vietnam you can rent karts bolted onto hoverboards. They have pedals for forward/backward that just tilt the hoverboard in the right direction. Very low-cost solution. Steering is normal with the front wheels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a great project overall but MDF is a very poor choice for the base. It will get destroyed as soon as it gets wet. At minimum they should have used exterior grade plywood, and painted it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43525129</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a framework for evaluating AI agents, proposing a "litmus test" to assess their capabilities and effectiveness. It emphasizes the importance of defining clear criteria for measuring the performance and reliability of AI systems in various tasks. The author outlines specific metrics, including decision-making speed, accuracy, and adaptability, to ensure that AI agents can function autonomously and responsively in real-world scenarios. Overall, the piece aims to provide guidance for developers and organizations in creating and implementing robust AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anthropic has a definition:  Workflows are systems where  LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
  Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks

https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-age...While I know it's a marketing term, I think a good distinction is that agents have a loop in the execution graph, and can choose whether to loop or keep going. Workflows are chained LLM calls where the LLM has no "choice".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Our litmus test for AI agents: Does the AI system perform actions under its own identity?So service accounts are agents? This seems pretty thin.In AI an "agent" is simply any code/workflow/automation that utilizes an LLM to respond to broadly defined external/environmental stimuli and decide how to react given broadly defined motivations and/or objectives.Not agent: Document comes in -&gt; If invoice return key-value pairs to make API call with.Agent: Document comes in -&gt; You're a finance professional: decided what to do with this document. Here are the tools/actions available to you: X, Y, Z.Both use AI and can achieve the same thing, but one is "agentic", while the other is deterministic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a bit amusing that so much ink has been spilled over what the definition of an “AI agent” is.I don’t care. I care what your software can do. I don’t care if it’s called AI or machine learning or black magic. I care if it can accomplish a task reliably so that I don’t have to do it myself or pay someone to do it.We had the same argument about 3 years ago when everyone started calling things “AI”. They use LLMs to generate text. Usually they have outsourced all of the interesting technical work to a handful of providers backed by big Web 2.0 companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560849</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impressive!35 kLOC is quite a bit. I wonder how straightforward and maintainable this app ended up to be. This would require taking a look at the sources. While good Rails code tends to be very terse, frontend may be quite voluminous.&gt; I believe within a couple of months, when things like log tailing and automated testing and native version control get implementedThis sounds a bit too optimistic, especially around automated testing, but yes, eventually this all will be there.&gt; an extremely powerful tool for even non-technical people to write production-quality appsBut why would non-technical people would even think in terms of log tailing and version control, any more than they think about the gauge of wiring in their walls, or the kind of modulation their Wi-Fi device use? For really non-technical audience to make a good use of such tools, it won't just take the AI to be a competent coder. The AI should become a competent architect and a competent senior SWE to translate from the product management language to the software development language, without even surfacing it when not explicitly asked. It's going to be quite a bit of a challenge to make it work, and work about as reliably as with a human team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also wrote a recipe simplifying website, so this is a fun project to see. Incredible work!Probably the main value engineers have for a maintenance project is context. I wonder what happens when we fully cede context to the machines...Today, I got a request at work for a feature ("let's offer coupons!") that I thought would take a week. That was until I found out that another engineer wrote most of the code last year, and it'd take him a day to dust off.I'm totally onboard with, and grateful for, larger-scale experiments like this...thanks for putting the effort in. I wonder how well Cursor (or similar) would handle a situation in which large amounts of code are _almost_ being used. What if 3k LOC accidentally get duplicated? Can our automated systems understand that and fix it? Because if they can't, a human is going to spend a _long_ time trying to figure out what happened.Over the next 18 months, I expect we'll hear a few stories of the LLM accidentally reimplementing an entire feature in a separate code path. It's a whole new class of bugs! :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help! I just made the Diarrhea Walnuts (https://www.recipeninja.ai/recipe/r_N1VSPtXzCJVV3l/diarrhea-...) recipe and it turns out I am allergic to Walnuts! I am throwing up everywhere! You’re gonna be hearing from my lawyers!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43553031</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One aspect of computer screen eye strain is the extra-ocular muscles not exploring using their full range on motion and instead being focused on the center of their field of vision non-stop. I went for a demo of the Apple Vision Pro hoping to have my whole field of view be one giant screen. Instead, the center is sharp and the periphery is extremely blurry. I was told this is to save on video processing resources.  To make something sharp you have to move my whole head to look face it directly. It didn't even come close to having as much useful field of view as a nice setup with a couple of monitors. It was really not what I was hoping for.The article promises that AR glasses will "keep the visual field broad and wide."  Maybe products will fix this in future iterations, but I'm not too hopeful for the near future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "peripheral area of the retina continuously contacts sunlight" part is just wishful thinking at this point. Every company in this space except Xreal has abandoned the idea of a see-through display, and Xreal has only kept it because their focus is on weight and comfort over features and it lets them avoid needing passthrough cameras and everything that goes with them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone else reading this comparing it with their personal experience using AR devices and thinking that the current devices Oculus/Apple Vision Pro devices feel like they are increasing eyestrain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43552385</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is no one going to mention that the first picture is AI generated tosh?  I understand that generating a picture is easier than taking a nice picture, in a nice place with a a nice camera - but the back row of the board is all white and the second row.. sort of disappears!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cute and I'm glad someone is doing that, but it's too small and out of proportion for tournaments etc.  You want squares of about 2.25 inches and king height of 3.75 inches, about.  If you're going to all the trouble of magnetic sensors and whatnot, you might as well make the board and pieces meet the relevant standards.These days, image recognition is good enough that it's probably feasible to just video the chess game on a non-sensory board, and let software figure out what moves were played.  In cases of doubt or dispute (blitz scrambles), humans can examine the video.If anyone cares, the tournament sensory sets that most organizers use are made by DGT and cost around $600 iirc.  The magnetic sensor system is very clever and was patented in the 1990s or so, but the patents would be expired by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I’m missing something, but why have a single piece PCB instead of individual parts with a 3D printed slot for the sensor and LED.A few wires later and a model scale up and your chess board can be a different size.I suppose one piece is easier and cleaner, just less flexible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43526118</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's true that free trade is hugely beneficial to the US economy as a whole, particularly with the USD being the reserve currency.The flow of goods is balanced by a flow of US dollars to other countries, which are ultimately cycled back into the US financial system - enabling budget deficits and an abundance of capital to invest in high growth industries.The flip side of this is that it also drives inequality - the upside of this system is felt by the entrepreneurs, investors and high-skill employees in tech and finance, while the downside is concentrated with low-skill workers whose jobs are offshored to lower wage countries.The obvious solution is not to hurt the economy as a whole, but rather for the government to lower the cost of high-quality education, build out social systems, and invest into onshoring select strategic industries by raising taxes at the high end.As such, this administration's policies are foolish, but many on this very site would need to give up a little bit of their privilege to reduce the pain felt by many of their fellow citizens.That is something that in the current American political climate seems a nearly impossible sell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From what I understand, de minimis exemption has also been removed.That is a huge, huge deal. It effectively means that all goods imported from China will be slapped with a 30% import tax, as soon as said goods arrive the US border / customs.Usually what happens then, is that the courier will pay that tax, and then bill the recipient later on - as well as charge some fee/fees for the work done.This is why in some European countries, that $1 item from China with free shipping can end up costing $10, because you're paying $0.25 in VAT or import taxes, and $10 to the shipping courier for doing the paperwork.If that is the case in the US, I fully expect total chaos and mayhem when all the Temu / AliExpress/ Wish customers start receiving extra bills for their orders.(That's just from the most obvious consumer example...then you have pretty much everything else. Goods, commodities, etc.)EDIT: I found more info here https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-pr...So it is even worse, you either pay $25 per shipment, or 30% - whichever is higher. Then later it moves up to $50 per shipment, or 30% - whichever is higher.a $1 item with $1 shipping will end up costing you as much as $52 after June!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aside from everything else one thing what strikes me as particularly insane is how it’s not even defensible as a protective measure. My favorite everyday olive oil comes from Tunisia. They now have a 38% tariff on them. There are no out of work olive farmers in the US.The orange man wanted tariffs, the orange man is going to get tariffs. Now we have to hope the American people aren’t so dumb as to still be convinced only he can solve their issues. I don’t hold out hope for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43561253</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's reasons for using a 17-year-old ThinkPad laptop, highlighting its durability, reliability, and practical functionality. The author contrasts modern technology's trend towards obsolescence with the ThinkPad's longevity and quality, emphasizing how it meets their needs without the distractions of contemporary devices. They appreciate its simplicity, ease of repair, and the satisfaction of utilizing an older machine in a disposable culture, promoting a mindset of sustainability and appreciation for robust design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish that Framework could attain the same lofty levels of "second hand market success" that ThinkPads enjoy. A lot of the "Thinkpad fans" I've talked to genuinely want them, or respect them for similar reasons they enjoy the ThinkPad legacy.ThinkPads are durable but every day they get older, slower and more difficult to source parts for as collectors entrench themselves and the requirements of operating systems (and the "modern web") worsenFramework laptops are wonderful, modern and (arguably?) cheaper to own in the long-term thanks to being able to replace components, particularly the entire mainboard as time progresses.*But* they're a tiny boutique manufacturer. Their barrier to entry is that of a pretty hefty modern laptop, versus buying a T420 for practically pennies and performing all kinds of aftermarket "mods" to it. 51nb's "FrankenPads" especially breathe incredible new life into old IBM and Lenovo stock.Combine this with the fact that being the "defacto business laptop" for nearly three decades (along with perhaps Dell) means there's enough Thinkpads on Earth to probably stretch end-to-end around the moon and back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally I think beyond T450 generation, i.e. over 10 years old systems, you are starting to make pretty severe compromises. T440 generation had really bad Trackpoint setup, and older hardware starts to lose features. Random stuff that T450 has that T400 doesn't* USB3* Up to 32 GB of RAM (vs max 8 GB for T400)* M.2 slot (for SSD), 6 Gb/s SATA (vs 1.5 Gb/s on T400)* x86-64-v3 (AVX2 etc) and OpenGL 4.6* Dual-band AC wifi and BT4.0 (optional 4G LTE WWAN)* DisplayPort with 4k@60Hz output* Slightly larger screen estate (1600x900 vs 1440x900), with FHD 1080p display option* Dramatically better battery life* Backlit keyboardMany of these are not merely nice to have but also ensure longevity by being compatible with lot of other modern stuff. On the other hand I do believe that T450 generation device might remain viable daily driver for a long while still. From the specs the biggest obvious shortcoming to me is the lack of USB-C, especially USB-C charging. But besides that, it seems pretty usable system.For reference, I have old X240 that I still occasionally use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tightness of hardware integration isn't a bug, it's genuinely a feature; In fact, it's the defining feature that makes Apple hardware great. Socketed RAM, CPU, and Storage just weren't worth the tradeoffs, namely size, weight, cost, and performance. Including those modular interfaces just wasn't worth it when the internal interfaces would be obsolete within 5 years, and the average user was replacing sub-components 0 times over the life of the device.The user being able to swap parts easily is _neat_ but it's just not an required feature, any more than the user of a car being able to easily hot-swap the engine. The right level of integration provides a tradeoff the maximizes reliability, cost, performance, and repair. A professional can still replace almost any component of a modern laptop, with a few thousand $ of specialized tools, and the battery, the only component with a fixed lifetime, can be easily replaced at home.I really hope Framework can continue to develop hardware with documented repairability, without falling for the myth that tight integration and quality are mutually exclusive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564111</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an imaginative exploration of an archeologist-adventurer character, delving into their journey and discoveries in ancient sites. It emphasizes the intersection of history and adventure, portraying the archeologist as a figure who uncovers hidden stories and artifacts, while also reflecting on the modern implications of their findings.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if anyone is interested in this story, but I remember at the height of the PokemonGo craze I noticed there were no shirts for the different factions in the game, cant rememebr what they were called but something like Teamread or something. I setup an online shop to just to sell a red shirt with the word on it. The next day my whole shop was taken offline for potential copyright infringement.What I found surprising is I didnt even have one sale. Somehow someone had notified Nintendo AND my shop had been taken down, to sell merch that didn't even exist for the market and if I remember correctly - also it didnt even have any imagery on it or anything trademarkable -  even if it was clearly meant for pokmeonGo fans.Im not bitter I just found it interesting how quick and ruthless they were.  Like bros I didn't even get a chance to make a sale.   ( yes and also I dont think I infringed anything).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't condone or endorse breaking any laws.That said, trademark laws like life of the author + 95 years are absolutely absurd. The ONLY reason to have any law prohibiting unlicensed copying of intangible property is to incentivize the creation of intangible property. The reasoning being that if you don't allow people to exclude 3rd party copying, then the primary party will assumedly not receive compensation for their creation and they'll never create.Even in the case where the above is assumed true, the length of time that a protection should be afforded should be no more than the length of time necessary to ensure that creators create.There are approximately zero people who decide they'll create something if they're protected for 95 years after their death but won't if it's 94 years. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same for 1 year past death.For that matter, this argument extends to other criminal penalties, but that's a whole other subject.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idk, the models generating what are basically 1:1 copies of the training data from pretty generic descriptions feels like a severe case of overfitting to me. What use is a generational model that just regurgitates the input?I feel like the less advanced generations, maybe even because of their limitations in terms of size, were better at coming up with something that at least feels new.In the end, other than for copyright-washing, why wouldn't I just use the original movie still/photo in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573156</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every few months I come back to this repo to check if they finally got Tailnet lock running or if someone security audited them in the meanwhile. Unfortunately neither of these things seem to make any progress and thus, I’ve grown uncertain in how much I can trust this as a core part of my infrastructure.The entire premise of Tailscale SaaS builds on creating tunnels around your firewalls, then enabling the user to police what is allowed to be routed through these tunnels in a intuitive and unified way.Headscale seems to have nailed down the part of bypassing the firewall and doing fancy NAT-traversal, but can they also fulfill the second part by providing enough of their own security to make up for anything they just bypassed, or will they descend to just being a tool for exposing anything to the internet to fuck around with your local network admin?
To me, not giving your Tailscale implementation any way for the user to understand or veto what the control server is instructing the clients to do while also not auditing your servers code at all sure seems daring…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in self-hosting your orchestration server, you can look into Netbird. It's a very similar tool, but has the server open sourced as well. So you have a self-hosted control server with a nice GUI and all the features the paid version does.https://netbird.io/knowledge-hub/tailscale-vs-netbird&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it would be neat if headscale allowed peering / federating between instances. (Maybe after the ACL rework.) One of the main problems is address collisions.So here's my proposal: commit to ipv6-only overlay network in the unique local address (ULA) range, then split up the remaining 121 bits into 20 low bits for device addresses (~1M) and 101 high bits that are the hash of the server's public key. Federate by adding the public key of the other instance and use policy and ACLs to manage comms between nodes.I think it's a nice idea, but the maintainer kradalby said it's out of scope when I brought it up in 2023: https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/issues/1370&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563396</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to implement CSS-only Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) to enhance user experience by improving perceived performance during image loading. It explains the technique of using blurred images as placeholders while the full-resolution images load, providing a smooth visual transition. The post details the necessary CSS properties and techniques to achieve this effect, including examples and code snippets. Overall, it serves as a practical guide for web developers looking to optimize image display on their sites.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool, I love seeing folks use CSS in clever ways. :)My one feedback would be to avoid using attr selectors on the style attribute like [style*="--lqip:"]. Browsers normally lazy compute that string version of the style attribute [1], but if you use a selector like this then on every style recalc it'll force all new inline styles (ex. element.style.foo = bar) to compute the string version.Instead if you use a separate boolean attribute (or even faster a class) it'll avoid that perf foot gun. So write &lt;div lqip style="--lqip: ..."&gt; and match on that.[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:thi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's obviously mostly an aesthetic nitpick for this blog post specifically and not the project itself, because few people are going to be exploring the encoded space outside of the blog post, but the sliders letting you explore the LQIP space would "flash" a lot less if the base color was encoded in the high bits instead of the low bits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since there're independent Lightness values set for each section (I'd say quadrant but there are 6 of them), I wonder if two bits can be shaved from the `L` value from the base color. It'd take some reshuffling and might not play well with color customization in mainly flat images, but I think it could work.I'm also curious to see that they're doing solely grayscale radial gradients over the base color instead of tweaking the base color's `L` value and using that as the radial gradient's center, I'd imagine you'd be doing more math that way in the OKLab colorspace which might give prettier results(?).Tempted to play around with this myself, it's a really creative idea with a lot of potential. Maybe even try moving the centers (picking from a list of pre-defined options with the two bits stolen from the base color's L channel), to account for varying patterns (person portraits, quadrant-based compositions, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523220</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the foundational aspects of software development, focusing on the importance of clarity in programming language design and the need for formal specifications. It emphasizes that precise definitions are crucial for understanding and preventing ambiguities that can lead to errors in software implementation. The text outlines various approaches to defining computational concepts and the implications of these definitions on programming practices. Overall, it advocates for a rigorous and systematic approach to programming to enhance reliability and effectiveness in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are sticking up for LLMs here and that's cool.I wonder, what if you did the opposite?  Take a project of moderate complexity and convert it from code back to natural language using your favorite LLM.  Does it provide you with a reasonable description of the behavior and requirements encoded in the source code without losing enough detail to recreate the program?  Do you find the resulting natural language description is easier to reason about?I think there's a reason most of the vibe-coded applications we see people demonstrate are rather simple.  There is a level of complexity and precision that is hard to manage. Sure, you can define it in plain english, but is the resulting description extensible, understandable, or more descriptive than a precise language?  I think there is a reason why legalese is not plain English, and it goes beyond mere gatekeeping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of this old quote from Hal Abelson:"Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that "computer science" is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology—the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is". Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to"."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally someone put it this way! Natural language has embedded limitations that stem from our own mental limitations -the human mind thinks sometimes too abstract or too specific things, and misses important details or generalizations.As a programmer, I know first hand that the problems or even absurdities of some assignments only become apparent after one has begun implement the code as code, i.e. as strict symbolisms.Not to mention that it often takes more time to explain something accurately in natural language than it takes to just write the algorithm as code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564386</guid></item><item><title>8.

It wasn't like that a while ago, e.g. when Coursera started, or it is not like that if you look at older MIT videos.Does it reflect university teachers getting younger? Or younger teachers tend to give more effort to putting everything online? Or did my perception change with age?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562109</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;Curl-impersonate is a Python library designed to facilitate the use of HTTP requests while bypassing bot detection mechanisms. It leverages the capabilities of cURL, allowing users to mimic real browser requests and avoid being flagged as bots by implementing techniques like managing cookies, headers, and user-agent strings. The library aims to simplify the process of making web requests in a way that appears more human-like, making it particularly useful for web scraping and automated interactions with websites that employ bot protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a fork of this that has some great improvements over to the top of the original and it is also actively maintained: https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonateThere's also Python bindings for the fork for anyone who uses Python: https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm rooting for Ladybird to gain traction in the future. Currently, it is using cURL proper for networking. That is probably going to have some challenges (I think cURL is still limited in some ways, e.g. I don't think it can do WebSockets over h2 yet) but on the other hand, having a rising browser engine might eventually remove this avenue for fingerprinting since legitimate traffic will have the same fingerprint as stock cURL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait a sec… if the TLS handshakes look different, would it be possible to have an nginx level filter for traffic that claims to be a web browser (eg chrome user agent), yet really is a python/php script? Because this would account for the vast majority of malicious bot traffic, and I would love to just block it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571099</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "overengineered anchoring," which refers to the unnecessary complexity often introduced in various design and engineering processes. It highlights how excessive features and complicated systems can detract from usability and efficiency, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and functionality in design. The text uses examples to illustrate the pitfalls of overengineering and advocates for a more streamlined approach that prioritizes essential features while maintaining effectiveness and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a backend person, sometimes I look at what's being done for front end stuff and pull back in ever so slight horror.It's an excellent article, and the work within is very well done, but there's a part of me that screams "Why would you introduce this much complexity for what should be a simple scroll?" (overcoming technical hurdles to produce the desired end result aside).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One could ask: what's the UX purpose of the "active anchor" indicator on the side navigation?One answer I can think of: if a reader is in the middle of a long section, and the heading is off the screen, it can remind them which section they're in relative to the others.This indicates (to me, anyway) that it's not a function of which heading you've scrolled to; it's a function of which section is on screen. If you use section-screen-area or something similar to highlight the active section, fiddling with the heading positions becomes unnecessary.If you have a tiny section at the end that can never take up the majority of the screen, then when the user is reading it, the active indicator won't really be useful anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I clicked, thinking that it was perhaps someone who like me was annoyed by Jira's anchors/permalinks which is a &lt;span&gt; with a &lt;button&gt; with a JS event listener on click to load what would normally be an &lt;a href&gt; into the DOM.But this, this is similar, but different. I can't navigate to anchors with for example the keyboard.Question for the author: Why not use the HTML &lt;a&gt; element rather than a JS event listener on a non-interactive element?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43570324</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a personal journey of the author who travels 600 miles to attend an organ recital in a small church. The narrative explores the significance of music and the communal experience of live performances, reflecting on the nuances of attending such events in a world increasingly dominated by digital entertainment. The author contemplates the purpose of their journey and the emotions stirred by the organ music, ultimately finding value in the connection and experience of shared cultural moments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some art-haters in the comments, so to defend this piece of contemporary art for a moment: one thing I love about it is a commitment to the long future of art, creativity, and civilization. What does it take to keep an instrument playing for six hundred years? To commit to that idea -- like the century-long projects of cathedral building in the middle ages, or the idea of planting trees you won't live to see mature -- is (to me) the awesome thing about the Halberstadt performance. All rendered in a medium (church organ) that has existed for an even longer time.It's a pretty hopeful, optimistic view of the future in a time of high uncertainty, but also represents a positive argument: it's worth doing these things because they are interesting, weird, and fun, and because they represent a continuity with past and future people we will never meet.Plus, you can already buy a ticket to the finale, so your distant descendants can go see it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;639 years? Big deal, The Long Now foundation built a clock to last 10,000 years. I hate John Cage since I got his massive world-wide hit 4′33″ stuck in my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am so happy that this is in my HN feed today.I wish there was more stuff like this, both in my feed and in the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43535937</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that it was ever seriously entertained that a "chain of thought" was giving some kind of insight into the internal processes of an LLM bespeaks the lack of rigor in this field. The words that are coming out of the model are generated to optimize for RLHF and closeness to the training data, that's it! They aren't references to internal concepts, the model is not aware that it's doing anything so how could it "explain itself"?CoT improves results, sure. And part of that is probably because you are telling the LLM to add more things to the context window, which increases the potential of resolving some syllogism in the training data: One inference cycle tells you that "man" has something to do with "mortal" and "Socrates" has something to do with "man", but two cycles will spit those both into the context window and lets you get statistically closer to "Socrates" having something to do with "mortal". But given that the training/RLHF for CoT revolves around generating long chains of human-readable "steps", it can't really be explanatory for a process which is essentially statistical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was under the impression that CoT works because spitting out more tokens = more context = more compute used to "think." Using CoT as a way for LLMs "show their working" never seemed logical, to me. It's just extra synthetic context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There’s no specific reason why the reported Chain-of-Thought must accurately reflect the true reasoning process;Isn't the whole reason for chain-of-thought that the tokens sort of are the reasoning process?Yes, there is more internal state in the model's hidden layers while it predicts the next token - but that information is gone at the end of that prediction pass. The information that is kept "between one token and the next" is really only the tokens themselves, right? So in that sense, the OP would be wrong.Of course we don't know what kind of information the model encodes in the specific token choices - I.e. the tokens might not mean to the model what we think they mean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43572374</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The list of dropped components is quite large. The cryptsetup, cryptenroll, unified kernel images, kernel signing and systemd-boot work nicely together.I think Systemd has a view that those things should reliably work together. I do not fancy a revival of the past where the user has to cobble a mesh of hopefully compatible libraries to achieve the same, taking weeks to study the Arch manual and resolving tons of gotcha's, all to be broken by next week's update.The integration of all this stuff is now actively under test and maintenance with systemd.And yes, the mentioned services also have an impact on the scope of service managing. Because if you have a unit that depends on a disk that needs to be unencrypted, this has to be resolved somehow in the right time.I personally have had no need for systemd-resolved, but I think for *desktop* the list of droppable components is not large.So maybe we should first have a conversation about the *desktop* vs *container-os* purpose?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an impressive project especially considering there are only 4 contributors.  In my opinion this should have existed prior to systemd as it is more modular and very much optional "The Suite may run either as an init system or as an auxiliary service management system under another init system."  This would have been a much better direction to go on Redhat in my opinion.  I might still be using CentOS or one of the forks had systemd gone this direction.  Just a personal preference of course but this does not feel forced and does not appear to commandeer functionality that should not be in the init process.  It's also interesting to see it implemented in Alpine Linux already though I do not see it in the edge repo guess I have to build it.  I use Alpine for all my VM and bare metal servers.  This may be worth tinkering with.  After this is extensively battle hardened I would like to see this as an installation option in Alpine, perhaps by setting a variable much like other installation options.  There are also some interesting notes in Myths and Truths [1]I hope they are still actively developing this. last 5 commit dates which appear low for an alpha.  Maybe we need to contribute to this or raise funding.    Date:   Fri Aug 16 18:55:06 2024 +0100

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the potential advancements and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) by the year 2027. It covers predictions for technological developments, the integration of AI in various industries, ethical considerations, and the importance of regulatory frameworks. The content emphasizes the transformative nature of AI on society, the economy, and daily life, while also addressing potential challenges and the need for collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and the public to harness AI's benefits responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s good science fiction, I’ll give it that. I think getting lost in the weeds over technicalities ignores the crux of the narrative: even if this doesn’t lead to AGI, at the very least it’s likely the final “warning shot” we’ll get before it’s suddenly and irreversibly here.The problems it raises - alignment, geopolitics, lack of societal safeguards - are all real, and happening now (just replace “AGI” with “corporations”, and voila, you have a story about the climate crisis and regulatory capture). We should be solving these problems before AGI or job-replacing AI becomes commonplace, lest we run the very real risk of societal collapse or species extinction.The point of these stories is to incite alarm, because they’re trying to provoke proactive responses while time is on our side, instead of trusting self-interested individuals in times of great crisis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though I think it is probably mostly science-fiction, this is one of the more chillingly thorough descriptions of potential AGI takeoff scenarios that I've seen. I think part of the problem is that the world you get if you go with the "Slowdown"/somewhat more aligned world is still pretty rough for humans: What's the point of our existence if we have no way to meaningfully contribute to our own world?I hope we're wrong about a lot of this, and AGI turns out to either be impossible, or much less useful than we think it will be. I hope we end up in a world where humans' value increases, instead of decreasing. At a minimum, if AGI is possible, I hope we can imbue it with ethics that allow it to make decisions that value other sentient life.Do I think this will actually happen in two years, let alone five or ten or fifty? Not really. I think it is wildly optimistic to assume we can get there from here - where "here" is LLM technology, mostly. But five years ago, I thought the idea of LLMs themselves working as well as they do at speaking conversational English was essentially fiction - so really, anything is possible, or at least worth considering."May you live in interesting times" is a curse for a reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones.Yeah nah, theres a key thing missing here, the number of jobs created needs to be more than the ones it's destroyed, and they need to be better paying and happen in time.History says that actually when this happens, an entire generation is yeeted on to the streets (see powered looms, Jacquard machine, steam powered machine tools) All of that cheap labour needed to power the new towns and cities was created by automation of agriculture and artisan jobs.Dark satanic mills were fed the decedents of once reasonably prosperous crafts people.AI as presented here will kneecap the wages of a good proportion of the decent paying jobs we have now. This will cause huge economic disparities, and probably revolution. There is a reason why the royalty of Europe all disappeared when they did...So no, the stock market will not be growing because of AI, it will be in spite of it.Plus china knows that unless they can occupy most of its population with some sort of work, they are finished. AI and decent robot automation are an existential threat to the CCP, as much as it is to what ever remains of the "west"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571851</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an interview with a university president addressing the issue of cowardice in academia and leadership. He emphasizes the importance of courage in confronting challenging societal issues, advocating for open dialogue and the need to take a stand against injustice. The discussion highlights the pressures faced by educators and leaders to conform or avoid controversy, as well as the vital role that brave decision-making plays in fostering a more engaged and responsible academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m an alumnus (matriculated a year or two after Roth became president). Wesleyan has a rich history of activism and protest, and not always entirely peaceful (Roth’s predecessor, Doug Bennet, had his office firebombed at one point).I’ve had a few opportunities to speak with Roth since the Gaza war started, and I’ve always found him particularly thoughtful about balancing freedom of expression with a need to provide a safe and open learning environment for everyone on campus. In particular, he never gave in to the unlimited demands of protestors while still defending their right to protest.In part, he had the moral weight to do that because—unlike many university presidents—he did not give in to the illiberal demands of the left to chill speech post-2020, which then were turned against the left over the past year.I don’t see any particularly good outcome from any of this; the risk of damaging the incredibly successful American university system is high. Certainly smart foreign students who long dreamed of studying in the US will be having second thoughts if they can be arbitrarily and indefinitely detained.But I hope the universities that do make it through do with a stronger commitment to the (small l) liberal values of freedom of expression , academic freedom, and intellectual diversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't see much talk of donors? My impression is that, as in many situations, the super-wealthy are forming a dominant class - as if it's their right - rather than respect democracy and freedom, and attacking university freedom. Didn't some person engineer the Harvard leader's exit?Roth says the Wesleyan board is supportive; maybe they are just lucky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43568655</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the theoretical foundations of gauge theories in high-energy physics, particularly focusing on the implications of non-abelian gauge symmetries. It discusses the role of gauge invariance in formulating physical laws and its impact on the behavior of fundamental particles. The paper highlights various aspects, including the derivation of the Yang-Mills equations and their solutions, as well as the relationship between gauge theories and the standard model of particle physics. The researchers aim to clarify complex concepts and provide insights into the mathematical structures underpinning modern theoretical physics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the magical thing that happens when AI research happens in the open. Deepseek published their model and their methodology and then the nice people at the University of Illinois are able to build on it.When OpenAI was launched this is what I thought it was going to be like. Something, something for the betterment of man kind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of comments. What’s not that interesting here is that adding search to an LLM increases accuracy — this is known, and largely implemented via RAG or other search pipelines which then stuff information into the context.What might be interesting here is that they are thinking about taxonomic tool use-cases, and exploring training and therefore optimizing the utilization of them.This to me is a proof of concept — an interesting one, but just a proof of concept. You can see from their example search that the model over-relied on search; it didn’t need to re-search three times to get the answer.A next step that I think would be useful would be updating the reward function to penalize search; pressing the model to use search when it needs to and not before. This to me is a likely framework going forward where MCP tool costing matters, and would be really useful to have in the next gen of tool calling LLMs.In the case of search we’d hopefully get a really useful signal and outcome for times the model is unsure — it would call a friend, and get good info! And for times it’s sure, we’d have taught it not to waste reward on that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool. I have a similar model that’s 8 days into training on msmarco.So far I only have the “cold start” data posted, but I’m planning on posting a full distillation dataset.https://huggingface.co/datasets/dleemiller/lm25&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563265</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally like trackballs with a large central ball where I can use all my fingers. I am aware Ploopy offers one. This style however has fallen out of popularity, but I've been using them since the mid-90s.Just using your thumb for all navigation seems like an RSI waiting to happen.Also I don't know who in the last couple years decided it's a "Trackball Mouse" it's just a Trackball in the same way it's just a "Trackpad" and not a "Trackpad Mouse"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have deformities in my wrist and I have small palms (dwarfism) I’ve tried various kinds of mice; none of them were comfortable and settled on using a Wacom tablet as a trackpad.Recently I started using Logitech Ergo M575 trackball  mice and it has been total game changer, I can even play FPS games quite well with it. I highly recommend trackball for those with accessibility issues like me and certainly welcome more open hardware competitors in the space like Ploopy as customisation is crucial for accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These types of mice are just not for me but I looked at some of their other products and honestly the thing I like most about them is how everything is open source.Ironically I think the fact that they open source their designs probably helps sales. My first reaction is to scoff at the $144 price tag but I know that if I go look at what it will take to build one myself I’m sure the $144 price tag will become much more reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43522060</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The premise might possibly be true, but as an actually seasoned Python developer, I've taken a look at one file: https://github.com/dx-tooling/platform-problem-monitoring-co...All of it smells of a (lousy) junior software engineer: from configuring root logger at the top, module level (which relies on module import caching not to be reapplied), over not using a stdlib config file parser and building one themselves, to a raciness in load_json where it's checked for file existence with an if and then carrying on as if the file is certainly there...In a nutshell, if the rest of it is like this, it simply sucks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a long time hobby coder, like 25 years and I think I’m pretty good(?), this whole LLM /vibecoding thing has zapped my creativity the past year or so. I like the craft of making things. I used tools I enjoy working with and learn new ones all the time (never got on the JS/react train). Sometimes I have an entrepreneur bug and want to create a marketable solution, but I often just like to build. Im also the kind of guy that has a shop he built, builds his own patio deck, home remodeling, Tinker with robotics, etc. Kind of just like to be a maker following my own creative pursuit.All said, it’s hard on me knowing it’s possible to use llm to spit out a crappy but functional version of whatever I’ve dreamt up with out satisfaction of building it. Yet, it also seems to now be demotivating to spend the time crafting it when I know I could use llm to do a majority of it. So, I’m in a mental quagmire, this past year has been the first year since at least 2000 that I haven’t built anything significant in scale. It’s indirectly ruining the fun for me for some reason. Kind of just venting but curious if anyone else feels this way too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aah.. I have been repeating this to my team for several days now. Thanks for putting this together.I start every piece of work, green or brown, with a markdown file that often contains my plan, task breakdown, data models (including key fields), API / function details, and sample responses.For the tool part, though, I took a slightly different approach. I decided to use Rust primarily for all my projects, as the compile-time checks are a great way to ensure the correctness of the generated code. I have noticed many more errors are detected in AI-generated Rust code than in any other language. I am happy about it because these are errors that I would have missed in other languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573755</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;GitMCP is a platform designed to streamline the contribution process to open-source software projects, specifically focusing on Git-based management systems. It offers tools and resources for developers to facilitate collaboration, provide feedback, and manage contributions efficiently. The platform emphasizes the importance of best practices in open-source development, enabling users to find and connect with projects suited to their skills and interests. Additionally, GitMCP provides educational materials and guidelines to help new contributors engage with and understand the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Simply change the domain from github.com or github.io to gitmcp.io and get instant AI context for any GitHub repository.What does this mean? How does it work? How can I understand how it works? The requirements, limitations, constraints? The landing page tells me nothing! Worse, it doesn't have any links or suggestions as to how I could possibly learn how it works.&gt; Congratulations! The chosen GitHub project is now fully accessible to your AI.What does this mean??&gt; GitMCP serves as a bridge between your GitHub repository's documentation and AI assistants by implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). When an AI assistant requires information from your repository, it sends a request to GitMCP. GitMCP retrieves the relevant content and provides semantic search capabilities, ensuring efficient and accurate information delivery.MCP is a protocol that defines a number of concrete resource types (tools, prompts, etc.) -- each of which have very specific behaviors, semantics, etc. -- and none of which are identified by this project's documentation as what it actually implements!Specifically what aspects of the MCP are you proxying here? Specifically how do you parse a repo's data and transform it into whatever MCP resources you're supporting? I looked for this information and found it nowhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some context.1. Some LLMs support function calling. That means they are given a list of tools with descriptions of those tools.2. Rather than answering your question in one go, the LLM can say it wants to call a function.3. Your client (developer tool etc) will call that function and pass the results to the LLM.4. The LLM will continue and either complete the conversation or call more tools (functions)5. MCP is gaining traction as a standard way of adding tools/functions to LLMs.GitMCPI haven't looked too deeply but I can guess.1. Will have a bunch of API endpoints that the LLM can call to look at your code. probably stuff like, get_file, get_folder etc.2. When you ask the LLM for example "Tell me how to add observability to the code", the LLM can make calls to get the code and start to look at it.3. The LLM can keep on making calls to GitMCP until it has enough context to answer the question.Hope this helps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We built an open source remote MCP server that can automatically serve documentation from every Github project. 
Simply replace github.com with gitmcp.io in the repo URL - and you get a remote MCP server that serves and searches the documentation from this repo (llms.txt, llms-full.txt, readme.md, etc). Works with github.io as well.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamentally, rules almost always come with compromises — for the sake of making rules understandable by humans, they have to be relatively simple. Simple rules for complex situations will always forbid some amount of good behaviour, and allow some bad behaviour. Many of society's parasites live in the space of "allowable bad behaviour", but there is a lot of value to knowing how to exploit the "forbidden good behaviour" space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the dangerous way I put it that I only tell senior people: understand why rules were made and make sure the people who made them would be happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a supervisor I didn’t resonate with this until I remembered in some jobs I have communicated the company attendance policy but didn’t enforce it unless someone was a poor performer. I trust adults to manage their own time until they give me a reason to believe otherwise.For my part, I’d rather trust people’s judgment and intrinsic motivation than enforce the rules. Enforcement is annoying, tedious, and distracting to my mission. However once I decide their judgement can’t be trusted I use rules to extrinsically motivate them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555220</guid></item><item><title>25.

They explain the control signal and what the servo does as a result. The "how" in between is completely missing though. How is that pulse translated? How does the feedback work? What are the safety mechanisms involved?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's about how radio control toy servos from the 1970s work. Annoyingly, those pre-computer dumb devices with no feedback output still dominate the low end of mechanical output devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve noticed that distributors  (Jameco, Mouser, etc) have a surprising number of introductory education articles.

In practice, o1-pro frequently provided clearer and more substantive insights than manual audits alone.This is not a dataset. This is an insult to the very idea of data. This is the most anti-scientific post I have ever seen voted to the top of HN.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "zxc" is an experimental JavaScript-oriented library designed for simplifying the handling of asynchronous control flows. It provides tools and patterns for managing asynchronous programming tasks, enabling developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code. The repository includes comprehensive documentation, examples, and installation instructions to guide users on how to effectively integrate the library into their projects. The library aims to enhance productivity and reduce complexity in asynchronous JavaScript applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caido founder here!Lots of nice stuff, since we are also in rust I see a lot of similar pattern in our codebase. I think your oneone crate could be split, we would probably be interested to collaborate on an http/2 support. We also have our own internal forgiving parser. It is an interesting thing to build tooling that must intentionally go beyond a spec since you basically have to reimplement all the primitives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the integration of the terminal with vim. I am making a site to learn vim motions called Vimgolf.ai and it’s interesting to see how your vim plugin works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does it need vim and tmux?Couldn't it use vim itself for multiplexing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43568771</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; for an electric guitar, a triangle waveThat is only true when the string is plucked exactly at the middle - not a regular occurrence. Usually it's more of a sawtooth wave, just without the upper harmonics.My experience with distortion in guitars is that a huge component here is how different it can sound depending on articulation. Some pieces for example require the player to not alternate their picking, but pluck only in one direction, as the difference is audible.This is not always the case of course as some amplifiers like those made by Mesa Boogie get their signature tone by exploiting the limited gain-bandwidth product(GBP) of amplifiers, creating an even sound that at the high end of the gain setting is largely without dynamics.In some cases(like the BOSS DS-1) the manufacturer killed the sound by introducing a technically better amplifier chip - the original had somewhat poor GBP and poor settling time, which in combination produced a nice lowpass filter with a resonance peak at the cutoff frequency, which in turn emphasized articulation.It's all a surprisingly huge topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distortion of monophonic tones (single notes/voices) became accepted in the mainstream quite rapidly because the circuits used to produce it quickly improved, informed by feedback (no pun intended) from musicians.Nobody hates ugly sounding distortion more than he or she who practices 5 hours a day with it.Single note distortion, at its best, is a harmonically rich sound which shares something with bowed instruments and reed woodwinds.Nasty sounding single distortion has not gained complete mainstream acceptance. Musicians who do that on purpose will remain niche, even today.  From time to time, such nasty sounds make appearances in mainstream pop, but only as a kind of "cameo". The statement is, "we are inserting this ugly thing here specifically for its idiosyncratic effect, haha! But only a few seconds, we promise".Distortion (other than perhaps mild distortion) has never been fully accepted in roles where the multiple voices of a complex harmony part would be distorted together.Nowhere was that better seen than in jazz/rock fusion, which accepted ragingly distorted guitars for solo work, but not so much for the rest of the music: except, of course, in passages where the guitars provide the "sound of rock": distorted fourths and fifths and whatnot, or double stop bluesy cliches and whatnot.The music best known for distortion and that couldn't exist without distortion (and a lot of it) is of course heavy metal, which is a big landscape of styles and sounds.In metal, the harmonies from an individual guitar part tend to consist of only a few notes. The clean chord is transformed into something else, which perhaps cannot be described in music notation. Complexity comes from the distortion. Distortion includes the sum and difference products, which relate to the tonality and scale of the music in unsual ways. Those notes are not identified. If notation is used at all, the underlying clean notes are notated: e.g. C-F# tritone on the A and D strings, over open E bass. Heavy metal uses syncopated and alternating rhythms to separate bass notes from upper notes in three and four note chords. This is not only to create rhythmical excitement, but to better separate the notes.The notes of a distorted chord are also easier to for the ear to identify if they are introduced separately as a lasciare suonare arpeggio; that's a thing in metal.Harmonic textures are also created by combining distorted guitar parts. Using two lead guitars originated in rock, with groups like Wishbone Ash. Multitrack recording allows an unlimited number of parts to be layered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos to the author for writing an academic thesis on distortion in music, but it sure reads like an academic thesis rather than a statement about art.In contrast, I thoroughly enjoyed and resonated with this short conversation between Henry Rollins (Black Flag) and Don Was (President of the Jazz label Blue Note) about distortion in music:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p6_WCqaucc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43575379</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently played cs2 for 4 months until the paranoia of closet cheaters got me.There are pro players who get caught cheating, this game is rotten to the core.Valve doesn't seem to care because apparently, players don't care about cheaters since they are so addicted to gambling with skins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There must be some statistical method or honeypot method to reliably detect cheaters.  Like present the players with a bot who's purpose is to be un-hitt-able unless the player is cheating.  I don't know, there has to be a way.  Cheaters are disease in online gaming. I know that sensible people won't want to sacrifice their anonymity to provide ID to play a video game but if it is in the competitive scene and they are playing for money, surely it isn't a stretch to ask for ID and thus ultimate accountability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$5-500 monthly payments just to bypass a decent anti-cheat...Cheaters must reflash their BIOS, wipe their PCs, reinstall Windows, and create a new account to play again...every few weeksThis is fun? If it's eSports for $$ I understand the incentive, otherwise pretending to be good, all the while likely having not a twinge of irony hit you as you 'git gud the opposition... It's a mindset I don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43574929</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Steam Deck, a handheld gaming device by Valve, highlighting its capabilities, performance, and user experience. It emphasizes the device's compatibility with a vast library of PC games, its powerful hardware specifications, and the ease of use for both casual and hardcore gamers. The review also navigates through its design, battery life, and the importance of software support, ultimately positioning the Steam Deck as a significant contender in the portable gaming market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No company is your friend. But Valve does a great job at being consumer friendly. Steam is a great low-pressure sales environment. It provides features that make it more enjoyable for users to play, hang out, communicate, share content, mods. It doesn't harangue you or change your settings, or the UI, or your games (mostly) without reason and warning. Things work like you expect them to in other apps, back buttons work. You can pop open multiple windows. It gets out of your way. You can even set your kids accounts to not have access to the store, something that literally no other company does. I'd love to disable the Minecraft Marketplace for my kids because sometimes they spend more time looking at things there than playing.GabeN called piracy a service problem. And he's right. I've received games free on other platforms like Epic or EA and I've bought them from Steam just so I don't have to use the terrible apps. If I was younger or couldn't afford it, maybe I'd be sailing the seas. I bought Alan Wake 2 on Epic since it's a timed exclusive. I plan on buying it again once it releases on Steam because Epic is just so terrible. All the effort went into the store and almost none into the actual act of playing the game which is where I'm spending the majority of my time while I'm in the app!Most companies don't care about customer satisfaction or post sales support. They have your money, why would they. Oh, yeah, repeat customers.EDIT: Just to add a gripe about Amazon. Their games app is so bad that if you use the back button on your mouse while a screenshot is open the page changes but the image stays until you close it. If you click on a game to view the details in a long list of games and then go back it loses your sort order and position in the games listing. It's frustrating to use even just to find something to play. Steam has its own rough edges, but they're not in the golden path of discover -&gt; buy -&gt; install -&gt; play -&gt; share&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It truly is, and it's the culmination of a long history of development to get to this point. Back in, I want to say 2016 or so, we had Steam Machines, which were a series of hardware partnerships with various vendors for a console-style form factor of essentially PC hardware running on the first version of Steam OS.It was an incredible idea, but at the time rather frustratingly, I think some people came down with what I like to call The Verge Syndrome, which is to judge things on whether or not they're an overnight success, and otherwise deemed failures. So, according to some people, the fact that there were fewer Steam Machines than PlayStations in the world meant that the project as a whole was a failure.And so the Steam Machine was not successful (by that metric at least), but it got the ball rolling on increasing sophistication in developing the Linux ecosystem and the understanding of hardware that culminated in the Steam Deck, which is a triumphant rebalancing of the PC gaming universe, away from dependence on Windows. But try telling that to someone in 2016.I'm happy to sing the praises of Valve, but I think a particular distinguishing virtue they're holding on to is being willing to play the long game and not giving up in the absence of overnight success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I purchased a steam deck when they first came out specifically to financially support Valve's Linux efforts and I haven't regretted that purchase for a second. In the past year I had a couple of days where my laptop was not working. I got out my steam deck, plugged it into my dock, and got back to work like nothing happened (after installing some software of course, like emacs). I've re-purchased games that I own on consoles just to get the PC versions to de-couple my games from hardware, so now I'll be able to run Flower on powerful beasts, portable handhelds, and computers that haven't been invented yet whereas before it was stuck on a loud aging ps3.My only complaint is console exclusives like the nintendo games. I don't want to have to purchase Nintendo's universal turing machine just to be able to run their software when I already have a perfectly capable universal turing machine. It would just lead to more e-waste and wasted closet space.Sure I can pirate and emulate the games, but I am an employed adult, I want to give you money for your games. Release your games on Steam so I can do that without burdening the world with more e-waste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43567923</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and size of VMS (Virtual Memory System), a prominent operating system initially developed for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the 1970s. It highlights VMS's robust architecture, which supports a wide range of applications and is known for its reliability and scalability. The piece also touches on its ongoing relevance in modern computing environments, particularly in enterprise applications, and examines the evolving ecosystem around VMS, including its compatibility with contemporary technologies and its community support.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any reason to use VMS today other than for existing applications that cannot be migrated? I've heard its reliability is legendary, but I've never tried it myself. The 1 year licensed VM seems excessively annoying. Is it just old and esoteric, or does it still have practical use? At least with Linux, multiple vendors release and support distros and it is mainstream, whereas with VMS, you'd be stuck with VSI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Cutler is one of my heroes. I think he only worked on the first version of VMS, but his expertise of OS design and implementation is probably second to few.Does anyone know whether he is still working in Microsoft? What does it feel to work with him?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a morbid curiosity about this system, but I don't really have a charitable view of it.The story as far as I know, goes like thisBack in the late 1970s Dave Cutler and his team create VMS at DEC as the next generation operating system for DEC's new flagship product, the VAX minicomputer.VMS is good by all accounts and was a successful product, but Unix goes on to dominate the minicomputer and emerging server market for the next decade.Then in the 1990s DEC goes out of business and sells VMS to Compaq, but not before porting it to their doomed Alpha CPU architecture.Then in 2000s Compaq goes out of business and gets acquired by HP, and together they port VMS to the doomed Itanium CPU architecture.In 2014, a shop called VMS Software Inc (VSI) strikes some kind of deal with HP where they get to develop and support new versions of VMS while older versions continue to belong to HP. As part of this, they finally announce an x86-64 port. This port first sees the light of day in 2020.----The story is essentially bad bet after bad bet, missing the boat and fighting the last war over and over again. And today, it's just a piece of legacy software being used to extract the last bits of value from the organizations that are stuck with it.Even so, I hope for a true open source release of it one day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573738</guid></item><item><title>35.

Just use a single period! I think one of the best decisions D made was to get of -&gt; and :: and just use . for everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it allow you to make functions weak? Can you do something like gcc's constructor attribute?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently gave this language a spin with raylib and libtmx for loading tiled maps. Out of C3, Zig, and Odin, I've had the least trouble integrating C libraries with C3 (rolled my own bindings for libtmx).

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the intriguing possibility that magician Harry Houdini may have engaged in espionage during his lifetime, particularly in relation to his connections with government officials and involvement in World War I. It highlights Houdini's participation in intelligence efforts, including his efforts to uncover information about German spies and his collaboration with various law enforcement agencies.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I understand this correctly, the `BroadcastChannel` API solves a similar purpose.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_C...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The subscribe() implementation seems suboptimal in the case where there are many different topics:    subscribe(topic, callback) {
        if (this.listeners[topic] == undefined) {
            // Not yet any listener for this topic
            this.listeners[topic] = [];

            window.addEventListener('storage', (e) =&gt; {
                const dataKey = topic + "_data";
                if (e.key === dataKey) {
                    const data =  JSON.parse(e.newValue)[0];
                    this.listeners[topic].forEach((v, k) =&gt; {
                        v(data);
                    });
                }
            }, false);
        }
        this.listeners[topic].push(callback)
    }

This installs a handler for every single topic, and every time a message is published, the handlers for all topics are called, even though at most one is interested in the change. A more efficient implementation would install a single handler, e.g. (untested):    window.addEventListener('storage', (e) =&gt; {
        if (e.key.endsWith('_data')) {
            const topic = e.key.substring(0, e.key.length - 5);
            const data = JSON.parse(e.newValue)[0];
            this.listeners[topic]?.forEach(v =&gt; v(data));
       }
    }, false);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built a ComfyUi node that let you run a little paint program in another tab. (Sorry about the lack of updates if you use it. I intend to get back to it)Negotiating the communication between tabs was by far the hardest part.  In the end I ended up using local storage for signaling to establish a dedicated messsageport channel.It was such a fight to make something that re-established the connection when either page reloaded.There are still some connection issues that I haven't been able to resolve.  It seems some browsers on some systems reject messages between tabs if they were loaded hours apart.It might be worth benchmarking a pure local storage fallback, but I'm guessing it would suffer with high traffic.A generalised implementation that allowed switching multiple paint programs and multiple ComfyUi pages would be ideal.  A PubSub might be the way to go.There's also the issue of other parts of the app also using local storage. Need to not step on toes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43569961</guid></item><item><title>40.

Even if the goal wasn't reached (getting the AlphaStation to boot), having something to show for a negative result still helps if someone else needs to go down a similar road - or, for that matter, needs to know not to go down a particular road.I likewise wrote a COVID-boredom-induced blog post about my many missteps, and eventual failure, getting AIX to run on an old PC. My "learnings" there were that the installation media (floppies) are _written to_ by the installer, making a reset to a known state rather difficult, and also that support for IDE disks was only made available in a patch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sounds like a case of "it's always the PSU" in figurative sense... e.g. half-blown fuses, dried up caps, good +12V but weakened 3V3 lines, oxidation on sockets, things of that nature.Or it could be platform quirks, or more interesting failures like crystal oscillator degrading, but I'd leave those to later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43531695</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the concept of a calibrated basic income as a potential solution to enhance economic security and address income inequality. It outlines the theoretical framework behind basic income models, examines its implications on labor markets, and evaluates how calibrated approaches can be tailored to individual circumstances to ensure efficient resource distribution. Additionally, it presents arguments in favor of this income model, highlighting its potential benefits on social welfare and economic stability while considering factors such as cost, implementation strategies, and socioeconomic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm interested in this as a faster intervention than QE. $10 given to a low income family will likely be spent that week. $10 of QE will just sit on somebodies balance sheet.Understanding BI as a tool of monetary policy seems to remove the ideologically charged view we see when it is considered as part of the welfare state&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish people would learn to keep emotion out of this topic. There is really one ultimate question here: "Is this the best use of our tax dollars?". Not: "Does this feel like the best use of our tax dollars?".Show me how much UBI saves police departments, social welfare services, the health-care system,etc.. and how many new tax paying consumers it produces. Is it a reliable investment on people or is it a poor gamble? I've been hearing about this since before the 2016 election, there should be ample data on this, instead of speculation. And I have no problem with cities/states re-attempting and retrying new approaches to UBI.That said, are there any studies or experiments out there where instead of a blind UBI, people are put in a labor pool of some sort where they get guaranteed income but if they're able-bodied they must make themselves available to perform jobs for the state or clients of the state? I'm thinking this should be the alternative to things like prison labor. Again, take the emotion and speculation out of it, what do we have left?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If people are paying a significant portion of their salaries, one-third or even half, towards rent, does it truly make sense to implement UBI? In my opinion, the answer is no. Instead, we should focus on establishing a Universal Basic Land: https://mertbulan.com/2025/03/02/we-need-universal-basic-lan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564644</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article on idiallo.com discusses the concept of "Code for Hire," which points to the growing trend of hiring freelance developers to complete coding projects. It highlights the advantages of this approach, such as access to specialized skills, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility in project management. The piece also addresses potential challenges, including communication issues and the need for clear project specifications, and suggests best practices for businesses to effectively collaborate with freelance programmers. Ultimately, it serves as a guide for companies considering outsourcing coding tasks to freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a coworker who _excels_ at writing code - one of those engineers who can metabolize caffeine directly into code.They write code to implement the all-important features. They write code to work around lack of process. They write code to work around problem people not doing their jobs well. They write code to work around buggy code by other developers. They write code to work around their own code, written weeks or months earlier.I've been encouraging them to _reduce_ the amount of code they write, and instead consider the context around why they're writing the code. Code is just one way - and not always a particularly good way - that we can solve people and process problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if the fact that we're not hired to write code, is also the reason we're not paid as much as some other roles. This is my big frustration: that senior programmers (in NL at least) are not paid as much as managers, POs, various kinds of architects, and even scrum masters.A couple of years ago, I was freelancing for a company where I wrote a lot of excellent code. They had a bunch of data they wanted to do something with, but weren't entirely sure what or how, so I did that for them. Connected, visualized it, made it fast, and they loved it. And so did I. It was fun work, I talked to a lot of people about what they wanted and needed, and delivered that.My freelance period ended, but I wasn't ready to leave this project yet, so I became an employee, but that turned out to be a massive step back in terms of income. Despite the fact that I worked closely with lots of stakeholders and solved complex problems for them, their internal rules didn't allow them to pay me as more than a code monkey. I felt all the non-code work I did wasn't being appreciated. Nor the code work.I left, they ruined the application (it's apparently slow as molasses now), and now I'm about to go back. I guess I've made peace with the fact that they don't pay programmers as much as I think they should. (It's not actually bad pay, just not as much as non-programmers get.) But mostly, it was a fun project that taught me a lot, and I want more of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In most companies, writing code is the last thing developers (should) do. You're there to achieve business objectives, and you were hired because someone thought your experience and skillset will be necessary to achieve those business objectives. Sometimes those objectives are met with an excel sheet, sometimes they're met by losely integrating various 3rd parties, sometimes they're met by integrating various libraries, and sometimes it requires treading new ground and writing some real code.The best web dev isn't the one that knows .Net, React, Svelte, GraphQL, micro-frontends, etc. The best web dev is the one that can convince their manager that their business objectives can be achieved by using WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563533</guid></item><item><title>45.

Need more cyberpunk in my lifeAfter spending all my money on creating a community platform no-one wanted, in a style that I thought would fit most people (but didn't particularly enjoy myself, too vanilla), I got tired and decided to create something I've wanted in my daily life since I read Neuromancer the first time 20yrs ago.This is what I'm working on. It's early, like really early, but it's a f*cking JOY to work on and use already! Right now I'm trying to move my friends over from Discord to this, but if there is interest in a voice/text chat app for a broader mass of ppl, I'd love to make a real product out of it and do this for a living!What ya think?

People are quick to judge the looks or three-wheelness of the car, but I think that's just a symptom of cars being marketed as status symbols nowadays.I am worried about production. With all of the years it's taking them to get there, they can run out of money at any time it seems. It's unknown if they can raise enough money on their terms to get this thing to production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love these things. Sadly, it’s like an Elven artifact: a beautiful elegant thing, built for people who just aren’t quite like us. Us (the mass market, 99% of car buyers) are orcs. We look at a thing like this and can’t see the beauty or utility of being efficient and having a light footprint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's new here?

Not looking to clone your business, just for a provisioning framework that allows for fiddling (as opposed to say something like proxmox, which allows for provisioning via a friendly UI but can't practically be tweaked behind the scenes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;every hackerspace should have a shared server like this. my college had an opensource club, and they had something like this for members to use/toy with. one of my biggest regrets is not going to those meetings more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534381</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The source code is such a fun read (for the comments). I found some source code for GW-BASIC, and here are two of my favorites:  ;WE COULD NOT FIT THE NUMBER INTO THE BUFFER DESPITE OUR VALIENT

  ;POP OFF THE BEGINNING BUFFER PRINT LOCATION AND INPUT A "%" SIGN THERE

Edit: GW-BASIC, not QBASIC (https://github.com/microsoft/GW-BASIC)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Jobs used to say the problem with Microsoft is they don’t have taste.The font-shimmering effect on scroll immediately reminded me of that, it is really distracting. And you can’t use reader mode to disable it.(FWIW, I’m a fan of Bill Gates and all he’s done for the world)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written an Intel 8080 emulator that was portable between Dec10/VAX/IBM VM CMS. That was easy - the 8080 can be done quite simply with a 256 value switch - I did mine in FORTRAN77.Writing a BASIC interpreter, with floating point, is much harder. Gates, Allen and other collaborators BASIC  was pretty damned good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43575884</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, the use of novel antibiotics must be strictly prohibited in the animal food industry.This is crucial because the misuse of antibiotics in livestock farming has been a major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global health crisis. When antibiotics are overused or improperly applied in animals, bacteria can evolve to become resistant, rendering these life-saving drugs ineffective for treating infections in humans and animals alike.It has always been a perversity that life-saving reserve antibiotics were ever permitted to prop up the grotesque machinery of the modern food industry—a system built on global-scale animal cruelty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the 1960s a Canadian research expedition collected soil samples from Easter Island which led to the discovery of rapamycin (aka sirolimus).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimushttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9634974/(Full disclosure - spent my PhD working with macrolides including this one.   It's an amazing origin story for a compound...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"New antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria" until we freely give the recipe to developing country pharmaceutical companies with no requirement to control distribution so now this antibiotic is given for a simple cough and we're back where we started.Antibiotic resistance is as much a political problem as a biology one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538853</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did the whole thing, was able to get the Fibonacci numbers appear and learned a lot during the process. However, I would not recommend other people to try this today, because --* It is not necessarily the best way to spend your time and money. You'll be looking at tens of hours on building it plus over $300 in parts, for a very slow and basic computer that you probably will forget and throw away at some point. Cutting and laying out wires are some of the most tedious and frustrating process. There are other cheaper, more efficient ways to learn how a computer works. It may or may not be worth the effort to you.* The tutorial is really old, with some very questionable design choices and no updates from the author. Some of the designs are just plain wrong -- e.g. floating inputs or missing resistors. It is very unlikely you can reproduce it by strictly following the tutorial. You'll need to spend time debugging those issues and go to reddit to see other people's experience with this, potentially seeking help as well. No doubt debugging is an important part of designing and understanding the circuit. But only if you have the foundational knowledge and patience, of which I happened to have, but I can imagine that someone who does not understand digital electronics well enough can easily get lost and feel defeated.* To make the previous point worse, some of the parts are hard to source, depending on where you are. (You'll likely fry or physically break a few components when building it.) Many of the parts are not very commonly used these days, and not exactly easy to acquire, if you only need 1 or 2 of them. I had to go to eBay to get some of them, which took about a week, during which I had to stop and wait for parts to arrive.With all that said, this may still be the best resource out there that lets you build all these on a breadboard, as I am not aware of an alternative that addresses all the issues above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always upvote Ben Eater's project(s).I got his 6502 kit and worked through his YouTube videos to get it up and running with LCD display and all. I want to actually frame it and get it running, hanging on a wall.If anyone is new to Ben, find a comfortable chair or couch, make some tea, take a breath, and begin your descent into his long-form breadboard series of nerd-splaining how a CPU works, beginning with basic logic gates.His follow-on series is a little higher level. He's still at it with the breadboards but he allows that this time the CPU (a 6502) is already built for us. He then walks through how the address bus works, how to attach RAM, etc.It makes me wish I could be transported back to the 70's when things could still be understood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Ben Eater computer is an interesting starting point. With a few modifications, such as an extended program counter / address bus, a combinatorial ALU programmed in flash, and a few more registers, it can be upgraded to a more powerful, if slow, computer.Further, these circuits can be directly simulated in an FPGA if you want to teach yourself an HDL like VHDL or Verilog. You really want to learn better and faster ways to organize a CPU, but it's a fun way for a beginner to bridge into this kind of work.At the local hackerspace, we actually taught a class that assembled a hybrid 8-bit / 16-bit variation of this computer with 1MB of RAM, an 8-bit ALU, a 16-bit data bus / registers, and a 20-bit address bus. With this additional capability, we could program it over serial with a very basic bootloader, and it was powerful enough to compute pi to 1000 digits. Granted, this took about 18 hours, but it could have run faster with a printed circuit board and a crystal oscillator. We just never really got to that point.As for how powerful such a computer with discrete logic can be, consider that the KB-11A CPU for the PDP-11/45 was built using 74-series logic ICs. It wasn't until after this system that DEC moved on to VSLI. So, this is a way to play with technology found in computers in 1972 / 1973.As a stepping stone to digital logic and FPGA work, Ben Eater's tutorial isn't bad. Just get yourself a copy of Don Lancaster's TTL Cookbook or CMOS Cookbook to bring his tutorial up to best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43533715</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the diminishing quality of critical thinking in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) due to the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence. It highlights how AI tools, while enhancing efficiency in data analysis and information gathering, may inadvertently reduce the necessity for human judgment and analytical reasoning. The piece warns that this dependency could lead to a superficial understanding of intelligence tasks, urging the OSINT community to maintain a balance between utilizing AI and fostering critical thinking skills in order to ensure comprehensive and well-reasoned intelligence assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

They were experienced professionals.Assuming these professionals were great critical thinkers until the AI came along and changed that is a big stretch.In my experience, the people who outsource their thinking to LLMs are the same people who outsourced their thinking to podcasts, news articles, Reddit posts, Twitter rants, TikTok videos, and other such sources. LLMs just came along and offered them opinions on demand that they could confidently repeat.&gt; The scary part is that many users still believed they were thinking critically, because GenAI made them feel smartI don’t see much difference between this and someone who devours TikTok videos on a subject until they feel like an expert. Same pattern, different sources. The people who outsource their thinking and collect opinions they want to hear just have an easier way to skip straight to the conclusions they want now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big problem in open source intelligence is not in-depth analysis. It's finding something worth looking at in a flood of info.Here's the CIA's perspective on this subject.[1] The US intelligence community has a generative AI system to help analyze open source intelligence. It's called OSIRIS.[2]
There are some other articles about it. The previous head of the CIA said the main use so far is summarization.The original OSINT operation in the US was the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service from WWII. All through the Cold War, someone had to listen to Radio Albania just in case somebody said something important. The CIA ran that for decades. Its descendant is the current open source intelligence organization. Before the World Wide Web, they used to publish some of the summaries on paper, but as people got more serious about copyright, that stopped.DoD used to publish The Early Bird, a daily newsletter for people in DoD. It was just reprints of articles from newspapers, chosen for stories senior leaders in DoD would need to know about. It wasn't supposed to be distributed outside DoD for copyright reasons, but it wasn't hard to get.[1] https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/d6fd3fa9ce19f1abf2b...[2] https://apnews.com/article/us-intelligence-services-ai-model...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"""•  Instead of forming hypotheses, users asked the AI for ideas.•  Instead of validating sources, they assumed the AI had already done so.•  Instead of assessing multiple perspectives, they integrated and edited the AI’s summary and moved on.This isn’t hypothetical. This is happening now, in real-world workflows."""Amen, and OSINT is hardly unique in this respect.And implicitly related, philosophically:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43561654&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573465</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe others will relate? I'm not a headphone person but always have music playing in the background on speakers — often at a fairly low volume so it is easily ignored, talked over.I find without the presence of external music I will have a song playing in my head instead. And generally the same song for hours (!). So I suppose the external click-track freezes up my mind somehow.In case anyone cares, my "playlist" is local music I've purchased over the decades — maybe 4 or 5 days long? In my "lab" (man-cave, I suppose) I have a shorter, streamed playlist on the stereo that is looping over new music that I am currently "auditioning". The songs that make the cut are purchased and added eventually to the local playlist that plays elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study finds you enjoy doing things you like. If there's something you particularly like, you seem to enjoy it even more.If you are missing on some form of pleasure in your life, substituting it for another pleasure can help alleviate the pain.Woah.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the cases I call reality mismatch:Through evolution we have been programmed to associate music with security of the group being nearby. Now we can listen to music even though the group is very distant in time and space. Maybe it's not a complete reality mismatch because in a sense we are still close to the group through the Internet.However the positive feelings are over exaggerated given the limited modern benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43540626</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has introduced native Python support for CUDA, enabling developers to write CUDA code directly in Python without needing to resort to C or C++ bindings. This enhancement aims to streamline the development process for data scientists and researchers who prefer using Python for their projects. The article discusses the implications of this integration, highlighting how it will simplify GPU programming and expand accessibility for those who may not be familiar with more complex programming languages. With this update, NVIDIA is positioning itself to better cater to the growing demand for machine learning and data processing capabilities in Python-centric workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

Definitely worth digging into more, as the API is really simple to use, at least for basic things like these. CUDA programming seems like a big chore without something higher level like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thank God, Pytorch gained so much momentum before this came out, Now we have a true platform independent semi standard For parallel computations. We are not stuck with NVIDIA specifics.It's great that parts of pie torch which concern the NVIDIA backend can now be implemented in Python directly, The important part that it doesn't really matter or shouldn't matter for end users / Developersthat being said, maybe this new platform will extend the whole concept of on GPU computation via Python to even more domains like maybe games.Imagine running rust the Game performantly mainly on the GPU  via Python&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CuTile, in many ways, feels like a successor to OpenAI's Triton... And not only are we getting tile/block-level primitives and TileIR, but also a proper SIMT programming model in CuPy, which I don't think enough people noticed even at this year's GTC. Very cool stuff!That said, there were almost no announcements or talks related to CPUs, despite the Grace CPUs being announced quite some time ago. It doesn't feel like we're going to see generalizable abstractions that work seamlessly across Nvidia CPUs and GPUs anytime soon. For someone working on parallel algorithms daily, this is an issue: debugging with NSight and CUDA-GDB still isn't the same as raw GDB, and it's much easier to design algorithms on CPUs first and then port them to GPUs.Of all the teams in the compiler space, Modular seems to be among the few that aren't entirely consumed by the LLM craze, actively building abstractions and languages spanning multiple platforms. Given the landscape, that's increasingly valuable. I'd love to see more people experimenting with Mojo — perhaps it can finally bridge the CPU-GPU gap that many of us face daily!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581584</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I miss Joe, he left us too early. He always had wild ideas like that. For a while he had this idea of a git + bittorrent he called it gittorrent, only to find out someone had already used the name. I think it was a bit of an extension of this universal functions idea.If you expand some of the comments below, he and other members of the community at the time have a nice discussion about hierarchical namespace.I particularly like his "flat beer and chips" comment:https://groups.google.com/g/erlang-programming/c/LKLesmrss2k---&gt; I'd like to know if there will be hierarchial modules in Erlang,
because tree of packages is a rather good idea:No it's not - this has been the subject of long and heated discussion and is
why packages are NOT in Erlang - many people - myself included - dislike
the idea of hierarchical namespaces. The dot in the name has no semantics
it's just a separator. The name could equally well be encoders.mpg.erlyvideo
or mpg.applications.erlvideo.encoder - there is no logical way to organise the
package name and it does not scale -erlyvideo.mpegts.encoder
erlyvideo.rtp.encoderBut plain module namespace is also ok. It would be impossible for me
to work with 30K LOC with plain function namespace.The English language has a flat namespace.I'd like a drink.alcoholic.beer with my food.unhealthy.hamburger and my food.unhealthy.national.french.friesI have no problem with flat beer and chips./Joe---&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need modules so that my search results aren't cluttered with contamination from code that is optimised to be found rather than designed to solve my specific problem.We need then so that we can find all functions that are core to a given purpose, and have been written with consideration of their performance and a unified purpose rather than also finding a grab bag of everybody's crappy utilities that weren't designed to scale for my use case.We need them so that people don't have to have 80 character long function names prefixed with Hungarian notation for every distinct domain that shares the same words with different meanings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those things where I don’t agree with the argument, but know the person making it knows way more than I do on the subject and has given it way more thought.  In these cases it’s usually best to sit back and listen a bit...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43554444</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a common misconception surrounding the preservation of sperm, particularly the claim that kerosene can be used as a means of extending sperm viability. It examines the scientific evidence and historical context surrounding this idea, highlighting that kerosene does not have the properties needed to effectively preserve sperm. The piece aims to clarify the topic by providing accurate information about sperm preservation methods and debunking myths associated with kerosene.&lt;/p&gt;

The whalers were processing their catch at sea even in the 1800s. Probably not as efficiently, but still they were not dragging their catch back to land for processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Soviet union had an outsized role in this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_the_Soviet_Union_an...To meet lucrative production quotas, the Soviet Union lied to international agencies about how many whales they were catching. While they didn't harvest the most amount of whales in the 20th century, they disregarded treaties that protected endangered whales and breeding populations.https://www.i-deel.org/blog/mass-killing-for-no-reason-the-p...The worst part is there was little to no actual demand for whaling products in the Soviet Union, so most of they collected was treated as a waste product or simply dumped.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a similar idea about energy transitions: ostensibly human kind has transitioned from wood to coal to petrol to nuclear etc. Given time we'll have transitioned to renewables for all our energy needs...In fact what happened is those energy sources kept being piled on top of one another. Today we consume more wood coal and fossils than ever before.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was at uni in NZ (mid 70s) me and my friends wrote a compiler for 6800s (an algol subset, it fit in 2k), we wrote it with copyrights for "uSoft" (that's a greek mu), in retrospect it was an obvious name at the time.Later we discovered some other guys using the same name in the US (also with a mu) they had a basic interpreter, how lame! (we had a compiler) however we really didn't understand the advantages of being born in the right place .....I really wish we'd incorporated, we could have sold the name for some silly amount of money&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's also almost 50 years since "An Open Letter to Hobbyists"[1]. It's amazing that in the last 30+ years, the "hobbyists" managed to turn the entire software industry by 180°, and that Microsoft themselves are reliant on that work.Bill even specifically mentions musicians. By 1976, when blues was only ca 100 years old, most bands would play what we now call "covers", credit each original writer on the back of the record, and there was no shame or stigma around it. Art builds on art, and "stealing" is probably the most important part of the process[2].[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists[2]: https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the majority of revenue of Microsoft is not Windows anymore, I think Windows defines the brand much like how iPhone and Mac define Apple even though that might be part of the revenue not all of it.What I am curious about is what happens when the original product that makes the company popular starts to experience poor quality. Take Google for example, its search has been on a decline in the last decade or so and needless to say the company is experiencing problems as well in the last few years. While GCP and GSuite are significant, people have lost faith in Google which probably started with search.Windows 11 and the iPhone seem to be heading towards same fate as Google search imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43539595</guid></item><item><title>12.

To this day I haven't found a teacher who could express complex ideas as clearly and concisely as Starmer does. It's written in an almost children's book like format that is very easy to read and understand. He also just published a book on NN that is just as good. Highly recommend even if you are already an expert as it will give you great ways to teach and communicate complex ideas in ML.[0]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75622146-the-statquest-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest challenge with ML models isn't the algorithm but the organization of contextual knowledge. In my experience, hierarchical structuring of documentation significantly improves results, especially when working with LLMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my other comment elsewhere. These resources helped me understand the topics better.If anyone wants to understand fundamentals of machine learning, one of the superb resources I have found is, Stanford's "Probability for computer scientists"[1].It goes into theoretical underpinnings of probability theory and ML, IMO better than any other course I have seen. But, this is a primarily a probability course that discusses the fundamentals of machine learning. (Yeah, Andrew Ng is legendary, but his course demands some mathematical familiarity with linear algebra topics)There is a course reader for CS109 [2]. You can download pdf version of this.
Caltech's learning from data was really good too, if someone is looking for theoretical understanding of ML topics [3].There is also book for excellent caltech course[4].Also, neural networks zero to hero is for understanding how neural networks are built from ground up [5].[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MuDZIAzBMY&amp;list=PLoROMvodv4...[2] https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientist...[3] https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse[4] https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Data-Yaser-S-Abu-Mostafa/dp/...[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&amp;list=PLAqhIrjkxb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586073</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the acquisition of Sierra On-Line, a notable company in the video game industry, and its subsequent decline. It details the initial success of Sierra, known for iconic titles, and how internal and external factors, including management changes and market shifts, contributed to its downfall. The piece serves as a retrospective on Sierra's impact on gaming and the challenges it faced during its transition from a pioneering developer to a struggling entity post-acquisition, setting the stage for further exploration in subsequent sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the 8pinLinux project, which is an optimized Linux distribution designed for development on the 8pin RISC microcontroller. It highlights key features such as support for real-time applications, a lightweight environment, and a modular design that enables efficient resource management. The project aims to provide developers with a streamlined platform for building applications tailored to the capabilities of the 8pin architecture, facilitating easier development and deployment processes. Additionally, it includes documentation and resources for users to get started with the development tools available in the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So, which pins could be combined with SDIO's three? After much thinking, the solution is obvious. RAM's nCS can be the SD card's CLK. RAM's CLK can be the SD card's CMD. RAM's MOSI can be the SD card's DAT. Try and figure out all the possible interactions with each device and what that would look like to the other, to convince yourself that it will work safely.This is truly a brilliant hack, well worth publishing at Hacker News.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always a bit saddened to see that a separate chip is the go-to method to interface with USB. Unfortunately USB is an incredibly-complex protocol that it seems anything beyond a basic V-USB running USB 1.1 at low-speed is generally not doable without specialized hardware and a significant software stack.  Meanwhile a protocol like SPI is ridiculously simple...the minimum hardware needed is a shift register that can be clocked fast enough. I miss how desktop and labtops used to have an exposed serial and parallel port, which could communicate at this low level. I often wonder if instead of USB existing that we instead stuck with UART, I2C, or SPI multidrop (using a small set of standard clock rates) for simple peripherals (maybe over a single connector like the 4-pin JST SH cable for Stemma QT, Qwiic and Grove) over a short distance, and then jumped to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet links for data-heavy peripherals like monitors and external drives. Then instead of having to have separate support for USB and Ethernet, you just would support Ethernet links.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent article, thanks. At the risk of missing the forest for the trees, I wonder how much simpler things would have been if you had been slightly flexible on the 8-pin requirement. It seems as though having just a few more pins would have reduced the complexity of the project significantly while only marginally increasing the time it takes to solder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586654</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Airbnb measures the lifetime value (LTV) of its listings to enhance business strategies and improve profitability. It explains the methodology used to calculate LTV, which involves assessing the revenue generated from a listing over its active lifetime, accounting for various factors such as user engagement, market trends, and customer acquisition costs. The piece emphasizes the importance of data analysis in optimizing listings and driving growth, while also highlighting challenges in making accurate predictions and the need for continuous refinement of measurement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this is missing a really important factor: how likely are guests to use airbnb again after staying at a listing?A listing could look great online and receive a lot of bookings (so high LTV), but ultimately drive users away from the platform.A certain ad platform I worked on cared a lot about this - offensive ads could get you to quit the site altogether. You might want to count every ad as positive for the company since you make money, but some might actually be negative expected value! As a side note, I think this is a really undermeasured problem. There are many sites I won't use because the ads are so overwhelming or are often offensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airbnb’s original promise was magical, thrilling, interesting - get to stay in unusual places that are full of charm and possibility.But that promise was broken for me when Commaleta played back the video of her front door camera and counted that we had 10 people walk in her door, not eight. She proceeded to accuse us of throwing a party, when we absolutely did not, and tried to charge us $1000 extra dollars.At that point, I decided that Airbnb’s hosts were too much of a wildcard in most travel situations.By the way, the story above is from 10 years ago and I will never forget her name for the rest of my life…she turned what should’ve been a relaxing, beautiful week into a miserable arbitration process. It’s hard for ABNB to succeed long term when one experience like that can ruin everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man I'm so sick of trying to find something on Airbnb only to discover by the time I order that the price has doubled.Airbnb these last years went from feeling fresh and adventurous to scammy and dubious&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43545674</guid></item><item><title>16.

It aims to replicate the functionality of Transputer systems, which were known for their parallel processing capabilities in computing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's incredible to see such an amount of Transputer work without seemingly mentioning either Occam or the microcode instructions regarding channels. The fact the Transputer was intended to be a high performance design is so often lost, and the development of the floating point units proved one of the more successful bits of the entire enterprise.The impressive part here isn't so much the emulator, but all the rest. A pascal compiler for the Transputer as a teenager in early 90s Mexico? That's brilliantly unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ooh I love this.Seeing a DOS transpiled into JavaScript is pretty cool. Seeing a DOS written in the 90s by a Spanish speaking native who wanted everything written in Spanish is AWESOME. Being told write AYUDA is great. I love the sense of ownership it implies the author had as a teen.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "local-first" web development, emphasizing the importance of building applications that prioritize local storage and offline functionality. It highlights how this approach enhances user experience by ensuring smooth accessibility, data security, and resilience in scenarios with limited or no internet connectivity. The author advocates for leveraging modern web technologies to create rich, responsive applications that store data locally while still being capable of syncing with remote servers when available, thus fostering a more user-centric and robust web experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive overview of Byzantine art and architecture, detailing its historical context, key characteristics, and major developments from the early Christian period through the fall of Constantinople. It explores various artistic forms, including mosaics, frescoes, and iconography, highlighting the influence of religion and politics on artistic expression.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I have to do the "click on the motorcycle/traffic lights" captcha more than once I will instead click the back button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, let me see what I think I understand here:1. AI models are good at Cæsar-cypher transposition, because it occurs often enough in training models for certain values of the cypher offset.  Outside those values, AI doesn't handle the transformations well.2. Somehow AI models perform this cypher also within high ranges of Unicode, because the characters are encoded as three tokens each, of which the last one encodes the same difference as between alphabetic letters, and so the first two tokens get discarded as irrelevant, meaning that by sheer chance the alphabet maps perfectly via Cæsar-cypher (with a two-token offset) to a specific range of Unicode characters reserved for Byzantine music notation.3. This is easy to understand for one AI model, because its explicable by chance that the offset between the alphabet and Byzantine music notation should coincide perfectly with two less-significant tokens.  It's harder to understand why this works in more than one AI model, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another thing that LLMs are (surprisingly?) good at is randomly mixed language conversations, here's something I tried a few days ago:Prompt: Kan du comprender questo text?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite Tcl story is a little side note about how Tcl could have been the language of the web[1]  the founding of Netscape   occurred at the same time I was deciding where to go in industry when I left Berkeley in 1994. Jim Clarke and Marc Andreessen approached me about the possibility of my joining Netscape as a founder, but I eventually decided against it (they hadn't yet decided to do Web stuff when I talked with them). This is one of the biggest "what if" moments of my career. If I had gone to Netscape, I think there's a good chance that Tcl would have become the browser language instead of JavaScript and the world would be a different place! However, in retrospect I'm not sure that Tcl would actually be a better language for the Web than JavaScript, so maybe the right thing happened.


Too humble Dr. Ousterhout!  It would have been a far better language.1 - https://pldb.io/blog/JohnOusterhout.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny that Tcl was mentioned today. I've recently been hacking on jimtcl[1] (a small footprint implementation of Tcl) to make objects multi-threaded safe, as that's the core language that folk.computer[2] uses (the main authors are making the interpreter and reactive DB parallelizable rn, so I've been tinkering with how to reduce copying).[1] https://github.com/msteveb/jimtcl
[2] https://folk.computer/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  Some content has been removed in the second edition of the book because of limits on the number of pagesLol, wut? The literal only working "buy it now" link is to a PDF. Page limits my ass. Or maybe "Paperback: 660 pages" was dangerously close to the Devil himself springing forth from the pages and turning all your codebase into VBScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586561</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The content discusses themes of boredom and its impact on creativity and everyday life. It explores how moments of idleness can lead to introspection and inspiration, suggesting that embracing boredom can ultimately enhance one's artistic pursuits and personal growth. The piece encourages readers to view boredom as an opportunity rather than a negative state, emphasizing the potential for new ideas and experiences that can arise from such moments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The best minds of my generationI’m tired of that line. I remember first seeing it on “the best minds of our generation being employed to sell you ads”. Making a computer go brrr doesn’t qualify anyone for a “best mind”.I’d hope a “best mind” would be, above all, empathetic. Concerned about the well being of their fellow humans. Philosophical about the state of the world. Patient. Curious. Wise and not just smart.That we keep putting greedy assholes on a “best minds” pedestal due to their ability to exploit others for personal profit is part of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
    1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and    is just a natural part of the way the world works.
    2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
    3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.
-- Douglas AdamsLet me guess your age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember, being terminally online is a choice. There's nothing to be bored of you don't choose to be constantly confronted by it. The current thing is only the current thing if you choose to surround yourself by people who deeply care about the current thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580449</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Attention Is All You Need" introduces a novel architecture for machine translation called the Transformer. This model relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence, which is typical in previous sequence-to-sequence models. The Transformer demonstrates improved performance by allowing for greater parallelization and efficiency during training while maintaining robust accuracy in translation tasks. It also proposes mechanisms like multi-head attention and positional encodings to effectively handle sequence data. The findings suggest that the Transformer can achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmark translation datasets, positioning it as a cornerstone for future advancements in natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not jus being impressed that every paper coming out is SOTA, but also leads the way in being Open-Source in the pure definition of OSS, even with permissible licensing.Let's not confuse the company with the country by over-fitting a narrative. Popular media is reenforcing hatred or anything that sponsors them, especially to weaker groups. Less repercussions and more clicks/money to be made I guess.While Politicians may hate each other, Scientists love to work with other aspiring Scientists who have similar ambitions and the only competition is in achieving measurable success and the reward it means to the greater public.Without any bias, but it's genuinely admirable when companies release their sources to enable faster scientific progress cycles. It's ironic that this company is dedicated to finance, yet shares their progress, while non-profits and companies dedicated purely to AI are locking all knowledge about their findings from access.Are there other companies like DeepSeek that you know of that commonly release great papers? I am following Mistral already, but I'd love to enrich my sources of publications that I consume. Highly appreciated!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeepSeek R1 is by far the best at writing prose of any model, including Grok-3, GPT-4o, o1-pro, o3, claude, etc.Paste in a snippet from a book and ask the model to continue the story in the style of the snippet.  It's surprising how bad most of the models are.Grok-3 comes in a close second, likely because it is actually DeepSeek R1 with a few mods behind the scenes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see deekseek using the correct (and much more idiomatic) term "inference-time scaling", instead of the grotesque construction of "test-time compute" that openAI came up with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578430</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Google has launched SEC Gemini v1, a new tool aimed at enhancing security for developers and organizations. This innovative platform integrates advanced security features such as vulnerability detection, compliance monitoring, and threat analysis to help teams build and maintain secure applications more effectively. With a focus on user-friendly interfaces and improved automation, SEC Gemini v1 aims to streamline security processes, reduce complexity, and support organizations in managing their security posture proactively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is generally something about the Gemini models which feels a bit different than Claude, ChatGPT or Mistral.I always have the feeling that I'm chatting with a model oriented towards engineering tasks. The seriousness, lack of interest of being humorous or cool.I don't know if this is because I interact with Gemini only through AI Studio, and it may have different system instructions (apart from those one can add oneself, which I never do) than the one at gemini.google.com.I never use gemini.google.com because of the lack of a simple export feature. And it's not even possible to save one chat to disk (well, neither do the others), I just wish it did.AI Studio saving to Google Drive is really useful. I lets you download the chat, strip it of verbose things like the thinking process, and reuse it in a new chat.I wish gemini.google.com had a "Save as Markdown" per answer and for the complete chat (with a toggle to include/exclude the thinking process). Then it would be a no brainer for me.It's the same as if Google Docs would not have an "Download.." menu entry but you could only "save" the documents via Takeout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Next, in response to a question about the vulnerabilities in the Salt Typhoon description, Sec-Gemini v1 outputs not only vulnerability details (thanks to its integration with OSV data, the open-source vulnerabilities database operated by Google), but also contextualizes the vulnerabilities with respect to threat actors (using Mandiant data).I remain still skeptical about LLMs in this space, although I might be proven wrong, as often happens. Nevertheless, OSV has already been a big advance, so it is great that it gets a further commitment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using AI systems for high-speed security actions, proactive and reactive, seems necessary but not sufficient:I expect attackers will also use AI systems, trained on the latest in effective attacks. What about defense would make defenders' AI systems more effective than attackers'?I think it's necessary because, if the attackers use AI systems then the defenders need to keep up.Also, we need to be creating far more secure systems to start with. Now it is, to a degree, security through obscurity - something is secure when attackers can't find the bugs fast enough. Security through obsurity wouldn't seem to work well when the attacker uses AI software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586786</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing economic challenges in the UK, focusing on rising inflation and its implications for consumer spending and business confidence. It highlights how the Bank of England's efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes may further strain households and businesses. The piece also examines the impact of these economic conditions on various sectors and the potential for a recession, while emphasizing the importance of government policy in mitigating the effects of inflation and supporting economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

Every demand of the simplest bourgeois financial reform, of the most ordinary liberalism, of the most formal republicanism, of the most shallow democracy, is simultaneously castigated as an “attempt on society” and stigmatized as “socialism.” And finally the high priests of “religion and order” themselves are driven with kicks from their Pythian tripods, hauled out of their beds in the darkness of night, put in prison vans, thrown into dungeons or sent into exile; their temple is razed to the ground, their mouths are sealed, their pens broken, their law torn to pieces in the name of religion, of property, of the family, of order. Bourgeois fanatics for order are shot down on their balconies by mobs of drunken soldiers, their domestic sanctuaries profaned, their houses bombarded for amusement – in the name of property, of the family, of religion, and of order.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook made a personal $1 million "donation" to the Trump inauguration in January 2025:&gt; Cook, a proud Alabama native, believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity, the sources said.https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-mil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555696</guid></item><item><title>24.

Is there any support beyond the wrist, or how resistive is it when you press the buttons?  Have you considered 2 hands too?  Do you feel like you've maxed out the number of comfortably reachable keys?  I guess you can't have keys off to the side since you can't move your hand relative to the keyboard.  Does the thumb do anything currently?I'm in this niche market too... although I don't really have an immediate use case beyond someday being more portable.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly every one of my clients have been invoice scammed. The amounts are typically five figures.When we onboard a new customer, I send a packet with payment information including how to direct deposit. It has this information:- Our routing/account number. We sweep the funds out of this account nearly instantly once the deposits are made. The bank account’s purpose is to accept direct deposits and nothing else. The account number we transmit over the phone so at least it’s less likely to end up sitting in a (compromised) e-mail box.- Our mailing address, which is a PO Box.- Some information on invoice scams, including an offer to review any suspicious requests free of charge. A customer takes us up on this every few months… so far we have yet to see one legitimate one.- A warning to never, ever accept changes for our payment information or mailing address unless told to do so in person by an officer of the company, with a list of the current officers.- If in doubt, mail a check to the PO Box instead of direct deposit.- A warning not to trust information sent via email, fax, phone calls (voice changers are a real thing), or from an employee/officer other than the one they usually interact with, and such a change must be confirmed with a phone call to a different officer.- A recommendation to also contact our local credit union (where we deposit payments from our customers) if they feel something is suspicious.- We have an internal rule that any change to bank accounts requires a meeting of 3 officers, in person or over the Google Meet we normally use for video calls (no phone calls) with meeting minutes conducted for the change. The change must be unanimous and the change can’t be put in for 30 days unless an emergency. Emergencies must be coordinated with a responsible person at the bank, in person. (Sorry, but this means no fintech etc. type of banks.) We recommend our customers to do the same.The biggest liability is that it would be hard for us to change bank accounts.We get an attempt on an invoice scam or otherwise every few weeks. So far we haven’t lost a penny of company funds due to fraud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It irritates me to read that people have lost their pension. Surely this should read, the pension fund has lost their pension due to "it safely breach"?
If a bank gets robbed they don't steal my money but the banks right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose it depends if it's worse than reported currently, but it seems to me that with only 600 accounts losing an average of ~$800 each (and I'm going to go out on a limb and assume the users had poor password security), the fast detection and the immediate action to lock it down, there was a good and effective response by the companies attacked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580101</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "advantage-weighted regression" (AWR) in reinforcement learning (RL) and its relation to "advantage smoothing," which aims to improve the stability and efficiency of policy learning in RL algorithms. It explains how advantage smoothing can mitigate issues related to non-stationarity and variance in training by aligning the updates more closely with the relevant state-action distributions. The author shares insights on the theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and potential benefits of using advantage smoothing in training RL agents, highlighting its importance in enhancing performance and stability in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting idea, but I'm sceptical of the advantages."there is more Co2" is valid for cars burning fuel. But as soon as you recuperate (even in a hybrid) you might only have a fraction of the losses any more. Adjusting the speed more aggressively is possible, without breaking, with little loss. I totally agree that stop-and-go is annoying, but looking into the future, Co2 should not be a reason for the vehicles in 5-10 years when the research can be rolled out.Is "slamming the brakes" still happening? Around here you have dynamic speed limit signs on the highway. In high traffic everybody then goes a little slower, but smoothly.I suspect that if a road is loaded beyond max throughput, this method will also fail, even harder.
Let me explain: I remember a graph from communications theory. With improving error correcting codes in transmission, you can get a clean signal for even worse channel conditions. But once it fails you will not have a signal any more. The better the code, the steeper the cutoff. Whereas without in FM radio, the degrade in user experience is also gradual.So the analogy goes like this: I would expect that you could possibly load the road with another 10% more vehicles. But if one day you have 15% more, the blockage will be even worse than before. 
Could be worth simulating throughput for various loading situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a certain satisfaction in anticipating these stop and go waves while driving, and timing it so that you catch the tail just as it starts moving again - the goal being to use the brake as little as possible and ideally only need to adjust acceleration. I don't really get why people feel the need to repeatedly accelerate up and then slam on the brakes, when leaving reasonable gaps makes everything go smoother.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice that this worked without need for communication between cars.This should be a built-in feature of adaptive cruise control in regular cars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555994</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing legal battle over the estate of Ayn Rand, particularly focusing on the actions of her longtime associate Leonard Peikoff and the implications for Rand’s intellectual legacy. It explores themes of control, philosophical inheritance, and the diverging paths between Rand's original ideas and their interpretations by subsequent followers. The piece also reflects on how this dispute highlights the complexities of maintaining a coherent philosophical movement in the aftermath of a founder's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584663"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tragic irony of Objectivism is perfectly captured in Peikoff's life story. A man who dedicated himself to a philosophy of radical independence ended up defining his entire existence through dependency. First on Rand, now apparently on his caregiver-turned-wife.I met Peikoff at an ARI event in 2009. He was surprisingly warm in person, but you could see the weight of being "the heir" in how defensively he responded to even mild questions about Rand's work. Now reading about the fracture with his daughter over the estate, it's like watching Atlas Shrugged's plot play out in real life: the bitter disputes over Rand's intellectual property mirroring the novel's battles over physical resources.What's most disturbing isn't the personal drama but what this reveals about how Objectivism operates in practice. For a philosophy obsessed with reason and independence, its institutional guardians seem remarkably focused on excommunication, loyalty tests, and controlling access to primary sources. The gap between preaching individualism while demanding conformity has always been the movement's central contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also get such energy from Atlas Shrugged, I don't understand why. I know that the good guys are very carefully crafted, they don't cheat, they don't do things like lobbying to win. They don't compromise on their world view to the extreme. They don't have children, that makes it all easier, but also less real.Raised christian but feeling burned out by the contradictions, the emptiness of trying to live for others (it's killing for relationships I can tell you), the mental struggle to rationalize all the rules, I too felt that spark. I realize dogmatism is always bad but that voice inside keeps saying: It's not when the theory is perfect! The truth is knowable and can be discovered through reason. How super comforting (and damn that Incompleteness Theorem I learned about later).I don't know what it is, my hunger for a system? For rules to make sense of the world? Whatever it is, Rand's philosophy remains so appealing. It's probably the reason I started a company, walk into meetings now boldly, with a goal, why I enjoy things now, just to enjoy myself. As a rational, healthy human, there is nothing wrong with that, in contrast to what my upbringing tried to instill in me.Perhaps that's it, it liberated my from a confining worldview. Perhaps another worldview could have done the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and wasn't impressed by either. The author never got the "show, not tell" memo. Long, long speeches.(In the movie version of The Fountainhead, Howard Roarke's architecture is terrible. His buildings resemble 1960s US housing projects such as the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. There's good minimalism, but that's not it.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584663</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has participated in calorie-tracking for an extended period of time can tell you that the visual appearance of food can be highly misleading to the number of calories in it.I'm all for making it easier for people to lose weight but this app may honestly have the reverse effect. If the app estimates calories too low (and therefore the individual eats more), many people will get frustrated with the lack of progress and give up. If the app estimates too high, the individual will lose weight, but diet fatigue and other negative side effects of being at a &gt;500 calorie deficit may make the diet too difficult to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a friend who came to me with the same idea. In challenge of the idea I sent a picture of some chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, and an other picture with the same chopped vegetables drizzled with a copious amount of olive oil. I asked if they can tell which one is which. The difference was hundreds of calories and you could not tell which one is which (least of all how much oil there is on the one with the oil.)That of course feels like a "weird" edge case, but it illustrates the general problem that butter/oil/sugars can pack a lot of calories and have no or almost no visual signature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My reasoning for evaluating the relevancy of this app:1. If the food being scanned has a nutrition label, I don't need this app.2. If there's no nutrition label, the app can't possibly extrapolate the nutritional information. It can't estimate portion size or the ingredients in the recipe.3. If the app can't extrapolate nutritional information, I don't need this app.4. I don't need this app.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563580</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember getting so deep in the weeds doing this kind of thing in responsively-resized Flash sites, a challenge similar to doing it in canvas. But what at that time I was trying to do (and what I'd really love to see now) was to reproduce runaround text the way you would have it in Quark or Pagemaker (or that newer Adobe program). Justifiable text flow within an arbitrary closed path shape, so you could have multi-column text with adjustable gutters, running  with curved borders around scaling embedded graphics. My solutions for that involved a lot of setup/tear-down of invisible text fields relying on native text handling, line by line or paragraph by paragraph, then a lot of remeasuring, and then a lot of optimization to make it more performant. I wrote a similar set of code for handling text in generated PDF files.As an old school print designer, I would love to see a return to a web with multi-column text on desktop, that reformatted to single column on mobile, and graphics runarounds much more complicated in shape than what a float can do. The art of typographic layout has been lost on the web, because those things are hard. An OS general-purpose engine that could handle layouts like that in any screen size, on Canvas or using absolute positioned divs or generating PDFs, would go a long way toward restoring artistic originality in the "layouting" of online publications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can count on one hand the number of times I've needed something like this in the last decade. But I'd also need to count the same number of times I've implemented a less than ideal solution that's ended up in prod. Great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi OP! Thanks for sharing.I don’t totally understand the point of this. Why would you want to use a Canvas renderer for this use case? If you want to render a massive table, apps will render a subset of it on regular HTML elements like EveryUUID [1].1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342382&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43583478</guid></item><item><title>30.

I fear that Debian main may have already went into a state where it is not able to rebuild itself at all anymore: the presence and assumption of non-free firmware and non-Debian signed binaries may have already corrupted the ability for Debian main to rebuild itself. To be able to complete the idempotent and bootstrapped rebuild of Debian, this needs to be worked out.Are any nonfree packages used as build inputs? If not, just ("just") bootstrap guix on a blobless platform, and cross build Debian from that&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an alternative to Guix with a much more strict supply chain security policy, consider: https://stagex.tools/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534143</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex legacy of Yoko Ono, delving into her contributions to art and music as well as the controversies surrounding her, particularly in relation to her marriage with John Lennon. It examines how Ono's work has often been overshadowed by public perception and critique, and discusses her impact on feminist art and culture, questioning the narrative that has historically framed her as a divisive figure. The piece highlights the need to reassess Ono's role and influence in the artistic landscape, considering both her achievements and the ongoing discussions about her identity as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;

Was she wierd? Sure.Was she wierder than anyone else in those times? Not really. The Chuck Berry gig is just a moment, it doesn't define her. The screaming shtick was a thing, sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;John got tired of the Beatles, his drug use made things worse. Paul's perfectionism did its part as well. Yoko was a distraction.She's a provocateur, art is the medium she uses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586113</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for the Bash INI Parser, created by user lsferreira42, provides a script designed for reading and parsing INI files in Bash. It offers functionalities to retrieve values from sections and keys within a standard INI file format, making it easier to manage configuration options in shell scripts. The repository includes documentation for usage, examples, and installation instructions, enhancing its usability for developers looking to integrate INI file support in their Bash scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My rule has always been that once a shell script gets too complex, it's time to rewrite it in real language. This library is way, way beyond that threshold.My recommendation for rewrite is "python with only stdlib". Using pip-installed libraries brings in the famous packaging problems, but you don't have to use it! Python's stdlib is fully "batteries included", and it has lots of useful things like ini file parser. And if your system has bash, it often has python as well, or at least it's easy to install. Things might get a bit more verbose, but they would be much more reliable and debuggable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For similar functionality have a look at crudini,
which is a utility designed for interacting with ini files from shell scripts:https://github.com/pixelb/crudini&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hint: for cicd usage you can parse ini files with git, often present in such situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43539892</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the peculiarities and unexpected behaviors in JavaScript, highlighting common pitfalls and quirks that developers may encounter. It explains concepts such as type coercion, the oddity of `this` in different contexts, the distinction between `==` and `===`, and the differences in variable scoping with `var`, `let`, and `const`. The author provides examples to illustrate these behaviors, aiming to raise awareness and help developers navigate JavaScript's idiosyncrasies effectively. Overall, the piece serves as a guide to understanding and managing the complexities of JavaScript coding.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many mistakes in section 2. The author seems to fundamentally misunderstand block scoping vs lexical scoping, and interactions when deferring execution to the next run of the event loop.In the first example:    for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i));
    }
    // prints "0 1 2" — as expected
    
    let i = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i));
    }
    // prints "3 3 3" — what?

i's scope is outside the for loop in the second example, and the setTimeouts execute in the call stack (e.g. the next run of the event loop), after i has finished incrementing in the first event loop iterationConsider that you'd have the same issue with the older `var` keyword which is lexically scoped    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i));
    }
    // prints "3 3 3" because i is not block-scoped

If for some reason you really need some work run in the next call stack, and you need to use the value of a variable which is scoped outside the loop and modified inside the loop, you can also define a function (or use an iife) to pass the value of i in the current iteration into (rather than getting the reference of i in the event loop's next call stack)    let i = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      (
        (x)=&gt;setTimeout(()=&gt;console.log(x))
      )(i)
    }
    // prints 1 2 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complaining about the for loop behaviour seems odd. Variables declared in the expression section of the loop are scoped to the loop body - this is generally reasonable and the least likely to produce errors.Notably, Go initially decided to stick with the C-style approach and have the scope be outside the loop, and has since decided that the tiny performance improvement this provides isn't worth the many many times it's tripped people up, and has changed the semantics in recent versions: https://go.dev/blog/loopvar-preview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember properly learning JS from “The Good Parts” book, which makes it known from the start that JS is a nasty language but if you ignore many sharp edges it can be nice and elegant. I think this is especially true with (a subset of) TS. All you need is a very, very strict linter, and then you get to pretend you’re working in a mostly solid language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43574026</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That grub has security vulnerabities does not surprise me, it's just too big. That's why Lennart recommends systemd-boot. (Incidently a Microsoft employee, but I have no information that he would have been involved in these discoveries.) U-boot again is typical embedded software, a field generally known  more for hacks than strict programming practices. So I cannot say I would be shocked. That said, I would be surprised if systemd-boot or Microsoft's loader had zero vulnerabilities hiding somewhere.When does Microsoft open their source for searching vulnerabilities?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"To demonstrate how efficient our product, CoPilot is, we've decided to use it to uncover vulnerabilities in competing products."Gee, how clever and thoughtful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well if Microsoft was as serious about security as they could be, they would have made sure the NT6 boot routine would boot Linux without needing Grub a long time ago.With the resources they have, and these unique findings AI has helped them discover, they should now be in the ideal position to rapidly correct this deficiency in their own bootloader, so that nobody will ever need to use Grub again.With this level of expertise, now enhanced by AI, and so much effort already behind them so far, it shouldn't take much to push this over the finish line, provided they have an effective enough organization when it comes to enhancing the security of PC users overall.  After all, they don't even have to worry about addressing Macs.I know the engineers are brilliant enough by far, and with nothing holding them back, we should be able to expect a minor revision of of the NT bootloader like this to be arriving any day now.According to what I see in the article, this would be one of the most timely &amp; useful security patches to show up on Windows Update, I hope they don't drop the ball on this one.Patch Tuesday is next week but they seem so close they could probably push this critical correction out before that, so watch for it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538073</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A long time ago, Britain was the dominant economic power in the world.Britain had a massive trade deficit with India. It imported far more from India than it exported to India.But what Britain did was import massive amounts from India and made high value goods at home and provided high value services that couldn't be provided elsewhere.Should it have flipped the other way? In 1800, should Britain have suddenly shifted gears and started massively exporting to India in order to balance the trade?Sure, India was a colony and not a mere trading partner, so no need to argue about that. But the US is also an empire that has bases around the world and has many countries in an economic chokehold. The situation is similar in a modern context since official colonization is kind of gone. The US takes in lower value products from around the world and sells them back to the original country at a higher price due to some sort of added value.Should America do the opposite? Should we drop all of our high value scientific and medical research, drop our engineering, and go all in on making t-shirts to balance the trade deficit? Because we very well could do this. We could steal away the fine industry of Cambodia and Bangladesh and have them buy all our t-shirts and balance the deficit pretty quickly. But is that a long term benefit?Cambodia and Bangladesh are countries that can't really afford to buy massive amounts of American high tech exports or foods. But they're essentially colonies that export goods to other countries, and through accumulating wealth through that development, more people can afford to buy American high tech products. But we're demanding that these countries buy lots of American products now with money that they don't have. The only way to balance that is to make things they can afford. Which means low value items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, and worrying at the time, but he clearly turned out to be wrong. The trend never stopped [1] and is not obviously responsible for any negative economic trend. The trend has continued [2]. The thing to worry about is probably not that it is happening, but who is holding these investments.[1]: https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international...[2]: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1HrHY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, you don't want to have "the world" own shares of american companies?Okay, let europe just sell all their stocks and ETF. But also, let them build alternatives to all american products. Let them keep the money they are spending for their Windows and Office licenses, their Netflix and Disney plans. Let them no longer create ad revenues on youtube.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a pretty crowded space, with a wide range of solutions for all kinds of situations. Have you looked into https://k6.io/ ? IMO it strikes a good balance of being simple to start with, but flexible to support advanced use cases if needed.At the very least, the first thing I would like to see is a comparison of your platform to existing tools and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. Internally we made a similar tool for performance testing applications, including fault and latency simulation of dependencies. It also includes analysis of resource consumption and whether performance and/or resource consumption have increased or decreased.This is now the second time a similar tool has popped up here at HN, maybe we should open source it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks neat, but I hate the "limited free" thing. What's the actual price? If I make this product a part of my team's workflow, what's the future sticker shock?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555409</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of growing buffers in data management to prevent the need for excessive data copying. It emphasizes the importance of having efficient buffer systems to manage data effectively, reducing the computational load and improving overall performance. The author outlines strategies for implementing these buffers, highlights common challenges, and provides best practices for optimizing data processing workflows, ultimately aiming to streamline operations and enhance data handling efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a major concurrency problem in Wine, the Windows emulator for Linux, related to this, which I encountered several years ago. Wine has its own set of DLLs which provide malloc-level services. When you grow a buffer, but it can't be grown in place, a new buffer has to be allocated and the old buffer copied. The trouble is that the copying takes place while holding a spinlock on the entire buffer pool. I had a multi-thread Rust program go into futex congestion and drop performance by two orders of magnitude due to this. 20 threads were all stuck compute-bound trying to acquire the lock. There are several layers of locking involved, and they fight.Wine bug only; works OK on real Windows.[1][2] (bugs.winehq.org seems to be down)[1] https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=37688[2] https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54979&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before using realloc, you have to do this:  void *sane_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
  {
     if (ptr == 0) {
       return malloc(size);
     } else if (size == 0) {
       free(ptr);
       return 0;
     } else {
       return realloc(ptr, size);
     }
  }

ISO C realloc has braindamaged corner cases. Some implementations behave like the above, in which case you can just have #define sane_realloc realloc on those targets.With the above you can initialize a vector to null, with size zero, and use nothing but realloc for the entire lifetime management: growing it from zero to nonzero size allocates it, shrinking down to zero frees it.malloc(0) doesn't necessarily return null; it can return some non-null pointer that can be passed to free. We can get such a thing if we call sane_realloc(0, 0), and can avoid that if we change the malloc line to:   return size ? malloc(size) : 0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first time I encountered the memory fragmentation problem common in hashtables wasn't even in a hashtable implementation, it was in a program that used realloc heavily, and doubled the buffer size every time.This was causing massive problems trying to concurrently read a stream over the network and start parsing it, because the realloc had trouble finding appropriately sized fragments. Once I pointed it out to the lead dev he used a different strategy and cut the load time on a multi-megabyte file by a factor of ten.Much later on I would learn that he could have also solved the problem just by adjusting the growth factor to 1.5 instead of 2x.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43540070</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the perceived economic decline in Britain, exploring various factors contributing to the feeling of poverty among its citizens despite economic data suggesting otherwise. It addresses issues such as stagnation in wage growth, rising living costs, and the impact of political decisions on economic stability. The author highlights the psychological aspects of economic insecurity and argues that the narrative around wealth and poverty in the UK is influenced by social and political contexts, ultimately shaping public perception and attitudes towards economic well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581672"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run an IT consultancy and often work in both commercial buildings and private residences across the UK. When it comes to the latter—trust me, the elites (and even the upper-middle class) still have an extraordinary amount of money.What’s changed is that no one cares about the public sphere anymore. You wouldn’t believe the contrast between Britain’s crumbling high streets and the lavish interiors of some of these homes. I’ve seen marble floors, $10K TVs, $100K kitchens, $150K bathrooms. Home offices decked out with $50K worth of gear. Wine cellars, indoor spas, private gyms—you name it.Even on the commercial side, it’s wild. It’s not uncommon to walk into a privately-owned or government-owned building and be greeted by a $5 million art piece in the lobby. Then you start looking around and adding up the costs—“they probably spent $10K just on that fancy trim around the doorframe.” Or you notice a particularly heavy door, Google it, and realize it costs $15K per door. Then you start counting the doors—there are thousands. The rabbit hole goes deep, and the amount of wealth becomes staggering. It’s just hidden in plain sight.But all of this wealth is cloistered. No one’s investing in the public-facing world. There’s a broad cultural resignation—from the elites to the average person: “Why bother fixing the outside world? Just survive the workday and retreat into your private kingdom.” The mindset has shifted toward building personal fortresses rather than shared prosperity.So yes, Britain feels poor—but it’s not because the money is gone. It’s because it’s been withdrawn from the commons and buried behind closed doors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a key part of the 'poor' feeling in day to day experience comes from councils' inability to do maintenance, things like pot holes, children's play equipment, public toilet, general upkeep on public spaces and services like libraries. In the grand scheme of things this isn't too expensive but it's been cut to the bone due to way local government funding works. This is explored in the article:&gt;  in large part because they’re mandated to write blank cheques for social care with no support or strategy from central government. Individual cases in Central Bedfordshire are now costing up to £750,000 per year, a quarter of the entire libraries and leisure budget and an amount that is rising rapidly with no apparent ceiling. As I wrote previously, “In a single year, residential care costs for children have increased by £2,000 per child… per week,” taking the average cost for a single case from ~£200,000 to ~£300,000 per child per year, again with little explanation as to where the money is going or how this is even possible.&gt; Similarly, “school transport costs have increased by over 100% - from £9m to £20m - in just 4 years” - that’s driven by an unexplained rise in the number of SEND pupils eligible for support and it amounts to roughly the same as - deep breath - the transport, roads, parking, libraries, leisure, housing benefit, public protection and safety budgets combined. Central Bedfordshire Council is not an outlier here - collectively, council overspends on SEND services are set to hit £2bn in the next year, risking further bankruptcies. Again this is not about pitting children against libraries, but asking if we seriously believe we’re addressing either of these things well?Local councils have to pay the very large bills for social care and supporting SEND children but have basically little control over how it's spent or levers to help control the bills.Fixing this so councils can once again spend relative minor amounts of money improving the public realm could go a long way to improving day to day experience. Definitely some other large structural problems (see the huge costs of HS2) but it would provide a noticeable improvement in people's lives and potentially isn't too hard for a government willing to make some bold changes around taxation, local government funding and providing proper national strategy and funding on social care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything that provides any service or assistance to normal life has been sold off and rented back to us at enormous cost, often with many of extra financial scalping included in the systems we are forced to rely on.
And a percentage of the extracted wealth is used to push political and public narrative to incentivise the selling off more.Local authorities are forced to sell off assets and fire direct employees, then get charged a fortune to provide basic services and child and adult social care.And for contracts and outsourcing, the ownership of the contract itself is the thing that gives value, not providing the actual service.  Creating a whole set of perverse incentives.A council should look at a pot hole in a road as a massive opportunity.  Here is a chance to provide good quality work for local people and local resources, but the opposite happens.We have a whole layer of service retailers e.g. for electricity and gas and communications, who are not more than a spreadsheet speculating on long term prices, a call centre and a web site.  Their entire business model being based on a) not messing up the spreadsheet calculation b) enough people being lazy and not renewing or switching their contract every year.Our financial services industry has massive positive PR, seen as a net good for the country.  When in reality it is focused not on basic things like providing banking and direct insurance, but in attracting our best and brightest individuals from around the country and instead of having them put their talents to something productive.  Instead reward them for creating and maintaining complex systems to move wealth around, asset strip regions, hide it from tax and create a layer of gambling and financial products on top of these systems.I could go on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581672</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Fantastically Wrong: The Hollow Earth" from Wired explores the concept of a hollow Earth, a theory suggesting that the planet has vast, empty spaces inside it. It discusses the historical origins of this idea, its portrayal in literature and mythology, and the figures who advocated for it, such as John Cleves Symmes Jr. and Edgar Rice Burroughs. The narrative highlights the scientific disproval of the hollow Earth theory, explaining how modern geology and physics have shown that the Earth is solid and composed of various layers. Ultimately, the piece reflects on the human propensity for fantastical thinking and the allure of such imaginative concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.inverse.com/science/hollow-earth-theory-history-...&gt; According to a 1716 paper mentioned in the book, Hollow Earth: The Long and Curious History of Imagining Strange Lands, Halley devised the Hollow Earth theory as a way to explain strange disturbances in the magnetic field that were connected to the aurora borealis — Earth’s natural light show. Halley was right about the magnetic field, but not so much about Hollow Earth..&gt; Years later, War of 1812 veteran and explorer, John Cleves Symmes, seized on the Hollow Earth theory.. to justify American expansionism.. into Antarctica. Similar to Halley, Symmes believed that the Earth was made of a hollow shell 800 miles thick, but he added his own twist: there were openings to Earth’s hollow core at both the North and South Pole. These he called “Symmes holes.” There, he believed that light — and human explorers — could descend underneath the surface into the hollow core.There was also a German sci-fi novel "Two Planets" by Kurd Lasswitz (1897), which influenced a young Werner von Braun who would later contribute to German rocketry and American space program, and write his own sci-fi novel about Mars exploration, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39571588&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/A5q1E&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, I happen to know a bit about this because his cult compound is a state park in Florida, in Bonita Springs. Highly recommend visiting! Say hi to the loose big turtles!The park is presented as a lovely old commune with vintage bungalows, a rare place where women actually ran things in the late 1800's and had a lot of freedom within the community to create art, plays, and raise their kids. A lot of the women were widows and this was basically the only option for them aside from marrying their dead husband's brother, or some other arcane ritual of the day. They paid for the upkeep and food for the "commune" by staging plays, and the men dealt with the outside world and negotiated for such transactions (to keep up external appearances of a patriarchy, something that was totally expected back then.)My wife and I were touring the place, having a good old time, and when we entered the community gathering hall/church, my wife started slapping my arm repeatedly to get my attention. She's gasping for air in an almost shocked laughter. She pointed to the giant model of the split-open Earth as interior, like the one shown at the top this article. The whole commune were hollow Earthers!!Of course, the bloom was then very much off the rose. A few things to know about Teed, in addition to the hollow Earth stuff, which we subsequently learned by reading more deeply into the interpretive museum text, therein:1: Teed believed he was Jesus Christ, or at least, that he would come back with Christ. When he died, the cult left him on the porch for a few weeks, waiting for him to get back up. The Sheriff had to come and demand they bury him, because the stink was so bad from the rotting corpse in the hot Florida sun. A testament to the power of belief, or delusion, you decide.2: The last Koreshanty-ist (As they were called) born and living on the Florida property admitted she was wrong about the Earth when she watched the moon landing on TV in 1969 in her bungalow.3: Teed believed his theory was true because he said if you walked in a flat, straight line in any direction, you would eventually hit an incline. This was absolutely true! BECAUSE THEY LIVED IN A SWAMP.4: Of course, 100% as expected, despite the ladies running the cult via committee and being very free in the cult society... All men except Teed were to remain celibate, but--OMG!-- there were plenty of babies! Teed 100% did the cult leader thing and had relations with every woman on the property. That's the real reason he built the cult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555728</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chef did not make a clean transition into the immutable world. Chef Client was great for persistent infrastructure, but the options got dicier once we started talking about pre-provisioned infrastructure like image building:1. Chef Solo (how I last used it when attempting this), which felt intentionally hobbled. All you needed was one poorly-behaved cookbook that called `search` and the bets were off.2. Chef Zero, which was unnecessarily complicated for being Chef Solo that wasn't intentionally hobbled, so much so that I kept using Solo for awhile after its deprecation.3. Chef Client, against a Chef Server that was run either for your other persistent infrastructure, or just to have a place to put the cookbooks. Heaven forbid you weren't cleaning up all of those dynamically-created nodes, though...I still think Chef's Ruby DSL is much more natural than the YAML manifests used by Ansible, and the ability to integrate at the source level with custom Ruby code is a killer feature as soon as any complexity enters the mix. But I almost certainly would not be using Chef in a greenfield deployment these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're still fighting with Chef slowness, hard to debug, complicated setup, you may want to consider Pyinfra.It is very well thoughout and simple to design and run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't encountered any Chef code in almost ten years. For the stragglers not yet primarily on Kubernetes and Terraform, I see Ansible and some extra Terraform. Maybe I see some Salt here and there.These are just my anecdotes, for sure, but (also anecdotal) I rarely hear of other "ops" type people using Chef, and most of the ones I know never got more than just their feet wet with Chef (the SaltStack beta was out early enough to avoid Chef).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43585354</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Germany's Deutschlandticket, which offers unlimited travel for a fixed monthly fee across public transportation networks, is seen as a key initiative to promote sustainable mobility and reduce carbon emissions. The ticket aims to encourage the use of public transport instead of cars, thus contributing positively to environmental goals. Studies indicate that, alongside improving transport accessibility, the initiative could lead to a significant reduction in traffic congestion and pollution levels, helping Germany meet its climate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like it pays for itself after 2 trips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mine's even paid for by the company, and on top of that we get a great discounted bike program: https://www.jobrad.org/Over 40 years old, lived in basically all the countries, never had a driver's licence!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; but some are saying it should be cheaper.That made me chuckleI know it's not the same thing but many in the south of England are paying £3,000-8,000/yr just to commute into London LOL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586182</guid></item><item><title>48.

Probably more indicative of the level I’m using it at, but for me it fills the gap where I just want to do some quick manipulations of CSV data but not enough that it’s worth writing a script.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I follow the link I am brought to extremely generic Apple support page with exactly zero indication that we are talking about the Numbers app.How do you determine, from this support article, the scope where it applies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Numbers was fully Excel compatible and I could get rid of this Microsoft spyware nonsense.  I even bought WP Office, but even that tries to force you into their cloud drive.I really wish there was a fully compatible Microsoft Office that I could use across my Apple devices that doesn’t shove some random cloud solution and end up with my files spread all over the place.  I would pay more to have a OneDrive less office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581137</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Yann LeCun's insights on the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the challenges surrounding it. It highlights the complexities involved in creating machines that can mimic human cognitive abilities, emphasizing the differences between narrow AI and AGI. LeCun expresses skepticism about the immediate realization of AGI and outlines criteria for evaluating its progress, focusing on benchmarks and testing methods to assess machine intelligence. The piece also touches on the ethical implications of AGI and the potential societal impacts it could have in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Last week, the ARC Prize team released an updated test, called ARC-AGI-2, and it appears to have sent the AIs back to the drawing board. The full o3 model has not yet been tested, but a version of o1 dropped from 32 percent on the original puzzles to just 3 percent on the new version, and a “mini” version of o3 currently available to the public dropped from roughly 30 percent to below 2 percent. (An OpenAI spokesperson declined to say whether the company plans to run the benchmark with o3.) Other flagship models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have achieved roughly 1 percent, if not lower. Human testers average about 60 percent.Arc AGI is the main reason why I don't trust static bench marks.If you don't have an essentially infinite set to draw your validation data from then a large enough model will memorize it as part of its developer teams KPIs.Forget all these fancy benchmarks. If you want to saturate any model today give it a string and a grammar and ask it to generate the string from the grammar. I've had _every_ model fail this on regular grammars with strings of more than 4 characters long.LLMs are the solution to natural language, which is a huge deal. They aren't the solution to reasoning which is still best solved with what used to be called symbolic AI before it started working, e.g. sat solvers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Chollet, a French computer scientist and one of the industry’s sharpest skepticsI feel like this description really buries the lede on Chollet's expertise. (For those who don't know, he's the creator of and lead contributor[0] to Keras)[0]https://github.com/keras-team/keras/graphs/contributors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to dismiss Chollet’s work, but I’m starting to think he need prove nothing to even the muggles. For example, nearly any endurance athlete stands a good chance of being a Strava user. If you run in those circles, have you heard a single person with anything good to say about Strava’s “Athletic Intelligence”? Garmin is rolling out a beta right now that includes “AI Insights” or summat. Same deal: useless summaries like “you ran 5 miles today, which contributes to your aerobic base”. I could do better with a database and some if/else statements. And Garmin wants a subscription for this.  (It’s included in Strava’s subscription, but I suppose you’re still paying for it.) And so now the memes tend toward “dumb AI insight of the day” on many online forums.Seems to me that a lot of folks are enjoying having an LLM rewrite their email or whatever, but I wonder how many are actually buying the rest of it? The companies themselves sure aren’t helping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43587628</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the enriching experience of pursuing side projects, emphasizing their potential to foster creativity, enhance skills, and provide a sense of fulfillment. It highlights how engaging in such endeavors can lead to personal growth and stress relief, offering a break from the routine of daily work. The author shares insights on the balance between passion and practicality, encouraging readers to explore interests outside of their main professional responsibilities. Ultimately, it advocates for the value of side projects as a means to cultivate joy and inspiration in one's life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an interesting read. I'm in the complete opposite camp. I can't pick up a game controller for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I'm wasting time.This has lead to many, many side projects throughout the years, which I tend to like a zen garden[1]. Pruning, refining, improving, and sometimes rewriting.As soon as I work out the game mechanics of any game, I just see it as just content now, and there is nothing holding me back to play any longer. Same with watching TV shows or movies, I lose interest pretty quickly and feel an urge to create something.I've always been very in tune with time, our lack of it, and felt like consumption is a waste of time.That said I believe creativity is hormonal (that is only my personal belief, unproven). It comes and goes. Some days I can't stop creating, somedays I want netflix and chill. But that's 10 days cycle of sorts, 10 days on, 10 days off.Depending on where you live, it's perfectly normal that due to current events, or a personal loss in your life, etc. you might not feel the creative bug tickling you. The creative hormone might be totally wiped by your current environment or predicament; tiredness, anger, stress, all play into it.After all, since our early days in the caves, drawing on walls, Humans wouldn't do so unless they had safety, a full belly, and a warm fire. A place to call home. Creative time needs conditions to be filled.[1] https://noben.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just thinking about this yesterday. A few weeks or months ago I started learning something new from an online course.Because I like using Anki to help me remember, I started copy-pasting stuff from that course to a spreadsheet to then export it as a CSV to import into Anki.One thing leading to another, my spreadsheet quickly ended with weird formatting everywhere that would be converted through macros to HTML tags to style the resulting Anki notes.This was still implying much manual work, so I finally figured I could just scrape the lessons for which I want notes via some script, and get the resulting CSV with a simple command.I'm been working on that scraper for two weeks now, and I just realised yesterday that that's the most time I've spent on a side project since too long to remember, and it brings me joy and motivation in the evenings and weekends. Also, apart from the occasional script, I haven't wrote a line of code for years, and I don't know why I ever stopped coding since I love this so much. And last but not least, I decided to go for Python, and I've never learnt Python so it's quite a challenge but also a satisfactory experience.All in all, this side project is spaghetti code with a dirty hacks sauce, I would never open-source it,  and it's never going to be useful for someone other than me.But it feels like I'm dusting off my brain, and rediscovering skills and passions I had long forgotten. Like finally waking from a long slumber. I'm currently a bit depressed, struggle to focus, and feel burnt out, but at least I am motivated by something and I create something for me, and this makes all the rest bearable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel this in my bones.  Side projects are so cathartic and saved my sanity at $DAYJOB.  I don't care that I can't implement things the way I want, or how everything is spaghetti, or how much tech debt has piled up, my side projects is a blissful world that I invented.  It gives me the "I am Jack's crap codebase" fight club zen at work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43587380</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tried it for a bit. Paid one month of the subscription.The dashboard is incredibly clunky and at the time they didn't have SSL for db connections (not sure about now). A lot of stuff you need to know what you're doing like configuring tags for Traefik etc.The deal breaker was it didn't have zero downtime deploys. Any pending request when you update an app is simply killed.I was expecting something like Heroku or Vercel but this ain't it.Ended up concluding that if I wanted to run/deploy apps on my own VPS I'd just use Kamal or Dokku. Both have zero downtime deploys, certbot, proxy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was also looking at alternatives -K8S-based
-https://github.com/cozystack/cozystackhttps://github.com/kubero-dev/kuberohttps://github.com/pluralsh/pluralDCR-based
-https://github.com/coollabsio/coolifyhttps://github.com/dokku/dokku/https://github.com/Dokploy/dokployhttps://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwaveMost of these projects are maintained by a single maintainer; for business critical apps look elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Coolify for about a year now and have been very happy with it. It's really low maintenance, it has built in backups for your apps and databases, decent security by default, and is super easy to use. I log into the underlying VMs once per month to do an apt update/upgrade, and that's about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:02:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555996</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;General overview below, as the pages don't seem to be working well  Llama 4 Models:
  - Both Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design with 17B active parameters each.
  - They are natively multimodal: text + image input, text-only output.
  - Key achievements include industry-leading context lengths, strong coding/reasoning performance, and improved multilingual capabilities.
  - Knowledge cutoff: August 2024.

  Llama 4 Scout:
  - 17B active parameters, 16 experts, 109B total.
  - Fits on a single H100 GPU (INT4-quantized).
  - 10M token context window
  - Outperforms previous Llama releases on multimodal tasks while being more resource-friendly.
  - Employs iRoPE architecture for efficient long-context attention.
  - Tested with up to 8 images per prompt.

  Llama 4 Maverick:
  - 17B active parameters, 128 experts, 400B total.
  - 1M token context window.
  - Not single-GPU; runs on one H100 DGX host or can be distributed for greater efficiency.
  - Outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on coding, reasoning, and multilingual tests at a competitive cost.
  - Maintains strong image understanding and grounded reasoning ability.

  Llama 4 Behemoth (Preview):
  - 288B active parameters, 16 experts, nearly 2T total.
  - Still in training; not yet released.
  - Exceeds GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on STEM benchmarks (e.g., MATH-500, GPQA Diamond).
  - Serves as the “teacher” model for Scout and Maverick via co-distillation.

  Misc:
  - MoE Architecture: Only 17B parameters activated per token, reducing inference cost.
  - Native Multimodality: Unified text + vision encoder, pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model training observations from both Llama 3 and 4 papers:Meta’s Llama 3 was trained on ~16k H100s, achieving ~380–430 TFLOPS per GPU in BF16 precision, translating to a solid 38 - 43% hardware efficiency [Meta, Llama 3].For Llama 4 training, Meta doubled the compute, using ~32K H100s and switched to FP8 precision. Despite the precision gain, observed efficiency dropped to about 19.7%, with GPUs delivering ~390 TFLOPS out of a theoretical 1,979 FP8 TFLOPS [Meta, Llama 4].I am not the one to critique, and rather, this is a recognition of the enormous complexity of operating GPUs at this scale. Training massive models across tens of thousands of GPUs stretches today’s AI infrastructure to its limit.Besides accelerating inference workloads, advanced GPU optimizations can be integrated into training and fine-tuning pipelines. From various kernel optimization techniques (over 90) to increasing memory access efficiency and scaling up to cluster-wide resource coordination, efficiency can be maximized with some complex software.References:

This is due to the types of training data available on the internet."Perhaps. Or, maybe, "leaning left" by the standards of Zuck et al. is more in alignment with the global population. It's a simpler explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595585</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can’t stop thinking about this article. I spent a long time in ad tech before switching to broader systems engineering. The author captures something I've struggled to articulate to friends and family about why I left the industry.The part that really struck me was framing advertising and propaganda as essentially the same mechanism - just with different masters. Having built targeting systems myself, this rings painfully true. The mechanical difference between getting someone to buy sneakers versus vote for a candidate is surprisingly small.What's frustrating is how the tech community keeps treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. We debate content moderation policies and algorithmic transparency, but rarely question the underlying attention marketplace that makes manipulation profitable in the first place.The uncomfortable truth: most of us in tech understand that today's advertising systems are fundamentally parasitic. We've built something that converts human attention into money with increasingly terrifying efficiency, but we're all trapped in a prisoner's dilemma where nobody can unilaterally disarm.Try this thought experiment from the article - imagine a world without advertising. Products would still exist. Commerce would still happen. Information would still flow. We'd just be freed from the increasingly sophisticated machinery designed to override our decision-making.Is this proposal radical? Absolutely. But sometimes the Overton window needs a sledgehammer.P.S. If you are curious about the relationship between Sigmund Freud, propaganda, and the origins of the ad industry, check out the documentary “Century of the Self”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fantastic article, I particularly like the point about humanity being more or less ad-free for much of it existence. I was just thinking about absurdity of advertising yesterday. As a life-long football fan (not soccer ;)), I was always bothered by the slow creep-in of those silly, mindless pre- and post-game interviews they do with players and managers nowadays. In the two decades since this has been happening it never occurred to me why these were a thing, until yesterday. In a lead up to a minor game, of course there was an interview with one of the players. In front of one of those panels with repetitive ads for various businesses. As it happens to be the case every time for the last 20ish years. Of course! The interviewees are just providing the mindless content, while my mind absorbs the background ads! So obvious, but it never occurred to me even once. Ad industry is really a cancer on society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This begs the question: how could you reliably distinguish advertising from other forms of free speech?The courts already distinguish "commercial speech" as a class of speech. Would we prevent all forms of commercial speech? What about a waiter asking you "would you like to try a rosé with that dish? It pairs very well together." Is that "advertising" that would need to be outlawed?What about giving out free samples? Is that advertising, and thus should be illegal?What about putting a sign up on your business that says the business name? Is that advertising?I hate advertising and propaganda. But the hard part IMO is drawing the line. Where's the line?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595269</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product manager ex. game designer with a number of puzzle/word game in operation here.- Having a timer (urgency) is usually not a very good idea for thinky games. If you insist on having a timer consider making it count upwards.- Additionally as other commenters mentioned is the game is a time trial it needs an explicit “Start” button. Also stop the timer when user is not playing e.g. reading the rules.- There’s no point of having a “Play again” option for a Wordle style daily game, the thinking part is already done, so any replay is just an exercise in dexterity.- It’s okay to be US-centric actually, doesn’t matter unless you are very serious about monetizing it, and even then being US-centric will work.- Consider showing rules for first time users before staring the puzzle.- Consider having some sort of overarching thing in your puzzle, so it’s not just five words on a specific topic to guess, but something more, like a hidden word across all five etc. This makes a delightful discovery moment and sometimes might work as a clue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On an older iPad I get "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading www.whatsit.today (see the browser console for more information)." neatly centred on an otherwise blank page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One small piece of feedback: typically these games do not allow proper nouns, because there’s too many of them. So having “Catan” be a valid word is pretty awful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:03:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593789</guid></item><item><title>9.

Install a bare bones pmOS image, plus this version of QEMU, and boot iOS on and Android phone.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a pivotal episode of "This American Life" that significantly impacted host Ira Glass and the show's direction. It highlights the theme and content of the episode, exploring how it reshaped storytelling techniques and audience engagement. Glass reflects on the challenges faced during production and the subsequent influence this particular installment had on both the radio show and his career. The piece underscores the transformative power of media and personal storytelling in fostering connection and understanding among listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

adequately to allege actual malice.”The “not statements of fact” included the reassurances that Carlson always made, in this case he said “Remember the facts of the case. These are undisputed” followed by clearly disputed and false claims.The lawyers argued successfully that it should be clear to the viewer that what Carlson says “cannot reasonably be interpreted as fact” even when he says that these are the facts.Arguably the bigger factor was proving malice, and Carlson seems very careful not to put anything into an email or text that undermines what he says on air.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-yor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes this fascinating isn't just what it says about storytelling, but what it reveals about our relationship with truth in media. I worked in public radio for 7 years, and TAL's influence was impossible to overstate - every producer wanted to craft stories with that perfect narrative arc.The Daisey episode still haunts journalism programs. We used it as a case study in our ethics workshops. The truly unsettling part wasn't just Daisey's fabrications, but how perfectly those lies fit into TAL's storytelling template - dramatic scenes, sympathetic characters, narrative tension, and a tidy resolution that makes you feel something.Glass wasn't wrong about storytelling's power to make people listen. But the Daisey incident showed its dangers - when your format rewards emotional impact and narrative elegance, you create incentives for sources to deliver exactly that, truthful or not.The saddest part is that real stories about Foxconn's labor conditions existed that could have been told without fabrication. But they wouldn't have had that perfect "old man touching an iPad for the first time" moment that makes for such a perfect radio beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43549893</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a proposal for integrating WebAssembly (Wasm) support into the Swift programming language. It outlines the potential benefits of allowing Swift developers to compile their code to Wasm, which would enable the creation of high-performance web applications and improve code sharing across platforms. The discussion includes technical considerations, possible use cases, and the importance of community feedback, encouraging Swift developers to share their thoughts and contribute to the vision for this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting proposal though it does sound a bit too general. “Improve cross compilation”… current Swift tools are barely keeping it together for the “happy path” of building for Apple devices (it’s not that happy). It would be cool to expand into wasm/wasi as long as it doesn’t come at the expense of other desperately needed improvements.Rust, Go and others have been building WASM 0.2 support for many years, they currently have a “just works” support for WASI. It would be a long time until Swift is even remotely ready for something like this and I don’t feel there is a burning need to have “yet another wasm platform”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we have a proper Windows support? i.e. with all the batteries/libraries included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopefully they make interface types available to the runtime. So you can read/write wasm struct properties from the host without all the usual glue code cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593596</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had one as a friend-pet for a while a few years ago. We went outside one day and found one leaf in our plum tree was tube-shaped with some spiderweb and after some waiting, off  she came (I have no idea if it was male or female but Spanish is a gendered language and spiders are female, so we always referred to it as “her”).Every day around noon she’d come out of her leave and wait to catch an insect. It was amazing to see her precisely jump to get it, and watching her eat was a mix of gross and interesting. I normally dislike spiders (though I don’t kill them unless I really feel threatened) but jumping spiders are an exception and I’d actually describe them as nice, almost pet/friend material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jumping spiders make great pets. The ones I've kept build silk tubes in the upper corners of their terrariums to hide and sleep in, meaning I could see them most of the time. They actively hunt, which is fun to watch. And even the common phidippus audax has bright coloring.  They only live a year or two, but it's cool to watch them grow.Beyond the facts in this article, jumping spiders have also shown spatial reasoning. When they see prey on another leaf behind their jumping range, they'll climb down and find a path to the prey's leaf, even if the prey isn't visible during this detour. They remember it's relative location and seemingly "choose" the best route to get there.Edit: You can also "hand feed" your jumping spider with a cotton swab dipped in sugar water. They drink flower nectar in the wild, so my wife and I tried this and it worked!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;jumping spiders are very cool but god this site sucks to use on mobile. 3

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a detailed overview of a tagless final approach to implementing programming languages in Haskell. It explains how this method enables the construction of interpreters and compilers by representing language constructs as Haskell types and functions, maintaining type safety and modularity. The author discusses the advantages of tagless final over traditional approaches, such as improved composability and ease of extension for programming languages. Additionally, the article provides examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts, aiming to help readers understand the practical applications of the tagless final style in developing language abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just got over writing 2 (well 2.5) toy compilers and I think a lot of the material in the compiler-teaching space lack some subtle developmental aspects.I wish there was a course designed somewhere which talked about more ingrained issues: how to structure/design the AST[0], buffer based vs noncontextual tokenization/parser design, index handling and error sync in the parser, supporting multiple codegen architectures, handling FFI, exposing the compiler as an API for external tooling, namespaces and linkage handling etc. etc. etc.It is refreshing to see how Carbon designed some of its components (majorly the frontend, yet to take a look at the backend) as it touches on some of the subtleties I mentioned. If someone is starting out on writing one, I would recommend taking a look at it or any of the talks.Always nice to see new material coming up. A few resources that I would like to mention would be dabaez's compiler course, Khoury college's compiler course (in Rust, previously i think and Ocaml), Nora Sandler's book as well as http://compilerbook.org; Which I consider to be the best guide out there for writing small learning compilers, the videos are good as well.[0]: Some related content that I enjoyed reading: https://lesleylai.info/en/ast-in-cpp-part-1-variant/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The notes reference:    "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction"
    Abdulaziz Ghuloum
    http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf

Can't recommend it enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another text using this approach:https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047760/essentials-of-compila... - Jeremy Siek's Essentials of Compilation (there's also a Python version)Admittedly I didn't finish working through it (life got in the way), but I worked through a good chunk of it with a colleague from a non-CS background. He wanted to understand compilers and it seemed to be much more effective than other texts he'd tried to work through. I'll have to look at this one at some point, probably this summer when things are usually calmer for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:04:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593088</guid></item><item><title>15.

[1]: https://sillycross.github.io/2022/11/22/2022-11-22/The major difference is that LuaJIT Remake's Copy-and-Patch requires "manually" copying blocks of assembly code and patching values, while this post relies on the Go compiler's closures to create copies of the functions with runtime-known values.I think there's fascinating processing being made in this area—I think in the future this technique (in some form) will be the go-to way to create new interpreted languages, and AST interpreters, switch-based bytecode VMs, and JIT compilation will be things of the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiling an expression to a tree of closures, and a list of statements to a slice of closures, is exactly how I optimized [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro)  my Go interpreter written in go.There are more tricks available there, as for example unrolling the loop that calls the list of closures, and having a `nop` closure that is executed when there's nothing to run but execution is not yet at the end of the the unrolled loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiling queries is one of those things that is both Make it Right and Make it Fast.Because bind variables and Prepared Statements go hand in hand, you want to do everything you can to coax your users into doing the right thing. If each unique query has to be compiled before first use, that’s an extra inducement to using prepared statements properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595283</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dumb question, but if register contention deadlock is possible, what would stop the shaders or hardware from, say, detecting the deadlock and spilling one or more threads to local memory?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I would have expected the request for additional registers to be linked into the resource request scoreboarding you see for texture accesses, rt hardware requests, etc.  Busy waiting on condition code seems non optimal, and opening the window for cases where one or all shader programs on core can no longer make progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a really good trick. New to me. Anyone know a reasonable way to do the query equivalent? Not allocate more, ask how many are currently available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595223</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive visualization of the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm, which is used for rendering lines in computer graphics. Users can manipulate parameters to see how the algorithm calculates pixel positions in real-time, demonstrating the step-by-step process of line drawing. This educational tool aims to enhance understanding of the DDA algorithm and its application in graphical applications. Through user interaction, visitors can grasp the concepts of graphics rendering more intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Original author here. I've been reading this website for years. Imagine my shock when I saw my own article on the front page! I'm glad people are enjoying it.Quick fact about the way the interactivity is done, all of the code for it is in this blogpost.js file: https://aaaa.sh/creatures/blogpost.js, which is only about 100 lines long. Each block has a list of scripts that it pulls from like so:&lt;div class="code-example" scripts="grid-sm 2d-vector-gfx-lib draw-grid full-algo-intro feather-canvas-edges"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and then there's a set of script tags with those ids. I figured it was a nice solution!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's incredible timing, I just spent 2 days trying to implement DDA from first principles for my wolfenstein-like game in C.Can't wait to see how you explain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, this is DDA, not Bresenham, for lines.An interesting point about Bresenham's algorithm is made by David Schmenk (dschmenk) on his "Bresen-Span" page:"Take note that the algorithm can be viewed as the long division of delta-major/delta-minor. The error term is really the running remainder, and every step results in a pixel along the major axis until the division completes with a remainder. The division restarts by moving along the minor axis and adding the dividend back in to the running remainder (error term). This is a bit of a simplification, but the concept is that the long division will only result in two integral spans of pixels, depending on the value of the running remainder (error term). We will take this in to account to write a routine that outputs spans based on the two span lengths: a short-span and a long-span."In other code, dschmenk does use DDA for anti-aliased lines.https://github.com/dschmenk/Bresen-Span&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:05:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543007</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Loader's number is a large number defined in the context of computability theory and is named after the mathematician John Loader. It is an example of a number that arises in discussions related to the hierarchy of large numbers and sets. The article discusses its properties, background, and significance in mathematical and computational settings. It also explores its relation to other large numbers, its calculation, and the implications of its size in theoretical mathematics. Overall, Loader's number serves as a fascinating example of the complexities involved in large number theory and its relevance to various fields within mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines ten essential rules for successfully negotiating a job offer. Key points include understanding your worth and doing market research to set realistic salary expectations, maintaining a positive and collaborative attitude during negotiations, and being prepared to articulate your unique skills and value to the organization. It emphasizes the importance of considering the entire compensation package, including benefits and work-life balance, rather than focusing solely on salary. Additionally, the author advises on the significance of being patient and willing to walk away if the offer does not meet your needs. Overall, the rules are designed to empower job seekers to advocate effectively for themselves while fostering a constructive dialogue with potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a company I've interviewed with, I've been asked twice a salary range and declined both times. I was even transparent for the 2nd time (which happened months later) and answered that it's not in my interest to give a number first.Well, I received an offer from them and I would have undercut myself by 30%.This is perhaps—or perhaps not—an extreme example, but I only applied what I was told in the negotiation articles and books I've read.When you read a book, you're going to think "It's just fantasy; no way this is going to happen to me" but if you actually apply that knowledge it can truly work in your favor.I also declined an offer 2 months beforehand because the salary was ridiculously low, despite being unemployed at the time.Want is fine, need is not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the sentences at the very start caught my eye:&gt; I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation?There's a wealth of actionable negotiation advice if you know where to look, like Harvard Business Review and Harvard Law, First Round Review, among others.One of the big pieces on negotiation I got from Harvard[0], from their Program on Negotiation. I did not attend Harvard, but reading two or three of their articles a week goes a long way.--[0]: https://www.pon.harvard.edu/uncategorized/what-is-anchoring-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked for resources a few years ago and found a post by a software engineer talking about "Fearless Salary Negotiation" [1]. The engineer said: "it's a small book, cost me around 40 bucks which were immediately compensated by the fact that I managed to negotiate a higher salary".I wanted to ask for a raise: I had been working in that startup for 4 years and had never had a raise. I thought "if that book helps me get a raise of a few bucks per month, that will pay for it".It didn't go as planned: I followed the instructions in the book, my boss spent an hour bullshitting me and I didn't get a raise. So I sent my resignation the next day. The boss called me back, and I got a substantial raise and a bonus (to compensate for the shitty salary I had been having before, it was not a miracle).All that to say that this book did not make me a pro negotiator. But it made me understand how salary negotiation works (reading it, I felt like a child: it only says common sense stuff, but I had been doing everything wrong my whole life). And it gave me the confidence to actually ask for a raise.Totally worth it.[1]: https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596864</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You pretty much need to use markup (or control codes) for rich text. Take bold, italic, underline, strikeout: those four can, and are, used in nearly any combination. You would need one bit for each of them. You would need two bits to specify four levels of headings. If you don't allow for that, you are back to using markup. You would also need one bit to specify proportional/fixed width font, because that is a thing too. That remaining bit would have to be used for superscript, since superscripts are commonly used for footnotes and simple mathematical expressions.Okay, you can now create passable rich text documents for a limited (though common) range of purposes with that 8/24-bit breakdown that was suggested. But you may have noticed the author mentioned subscripts, which wasn't in my list. Well, it turns out that subscript and superscript have a terribly limited range of applications if you are specifying them per character: x^2^2 would be visually identical to x^22, and x^a_b would look different from x_b^a (with both presentations being nonsensical). The use of subscripts and superscripts in any technical applications would be severely limited. You need a much richer markup language to be truly expressive. So there really isn't much of a point in offering subscripts. Superscripts, sure, because they have a few non-technical uses.Yet the reality is that people want a much richer set of formatting options. At a minimum, they want to select fonts and font sizes. Some of the formatting options have semantics. I know I crammed four levels of headings in those eight bits, but that only makes sense in headings. It doesn't make sense to specify it per character. Then there are other common document elements, like tables. You can create decent tables using monospaced fonts, but that is limiting and would produce undesirable results in some cases (try displaying April 5^th sensibly, using a monospace font so that it won't affect the width of the columns). On top of that, you are ditching the concept of styles because that implies some sort of markup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The odd thing is, you can do quite some bold/italics/superscript in Unicode nowadays. Because, at least from the ASCII letter range, they have been used in symbolic ways in Mathematics, etc., and have been added to Unicode as symbols rather than bold variants of letters. For example:, !, !ᴴᵉˡˡᵒ, ᵂᵒʳˡᵈ!So, there's almost no bold/italic punctuation. And non-ASCII Unicode letters aren't "supported" this way either. But you can get quite far with "formatted" ASCII letters in Unicode, if you're so inclined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hah, I was about to criticise the text for far too lightly conflating markup and punctuation, just to see the afterword.I actually do think the author has a point, in that must solutions today are inelegant, I also don't think this is a problem which has a real elegant solution. Where to draw the line? Why not encode fonts into the standard too, if we're doing bold? Etc.I'm still mostly in favour of keeping everything markdown (in my own writing), however much it pollutes the "purity" of text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562894</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every web server claims to be fast, so I wonder how they define that. As someone who has written their own supposedly fast web server I only want configuration simplicity. Most web servers are unnecessarily far too complicated.In a web server here is what I am looking for:* Fast. That is just a matter of streams and pipes. More on this later. That said the language the web server is written in largely irrelevant to its real world performance so long as it can execute low level streams and pipes.* HTTP and WebSocket support. Ideally a web server will support both on the same port. It’s not challenging because you just have to examine the first incoming payload on the connection.* Security. This does not have to be complicated. Let the server administrator define their own security rules and just execute those rules on incoming connections. For everything that fails just destroy the connection. Don’t send any response.* Proxy/reverse proxy support. This is more simple than it sounds. It’s just a pipe to another local existing stream or piping to a new stream opened to a specified location. If authentication is required it can be the same authentication that sits behind the regular 403 HTTP response. The direction of the proxy is just a matter of who pipes to who.* TLS with and without certificate trust. I HATE certificates with extreme anger, especially for localhost connections. A good web server will account for that anger.* File system support. Reading from the file system for a specific resource by name should be a low level stream via file descriptor piped back to the response. If this specific file system resource is something internally required by the application, like a default homepage it should be read only once and then forever fetched from memory by variable name. Displaying file system resources, like a directory listing, doesn’t have to be slow or primitive or brittle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/errantmind/faf is the fastest Rust static "web server" per the most recent TechEmpower Round 23 (Plaintext); it is purposely barebones (provide content via Rust callback!) The top 3 Composite scores are all Rust web frameworks, also not necessarily intended as general-purpose web servers.https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server wins the SEO (and GitHub star) battle, though apparently it is old enough to have a couple unmaintained dependencies.I use https://github.com/sigoden/dufs as my personal file transfer Swiss Army knife since it natively supports file uploads; I will check out Ferron as a lighter reverse proxy with automatic SSL certs vs. Caddy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really good Caddy replacement. The configuration format Caddy uses sometimes feels oversimplified in that complex configurations are hard to read. My instincts tell me this could scale better without getting more verbose. I'm definitely considering a migration if this project matures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:06:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555249</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Python's CPU caching mechanisms, specifically focusing on how caching improves performance for applications by reducing computation time and memory access. It explains the concept of cache memory within CPU architectures and its relevance to Python programming, highlighting strategies to effectively utilize caching in Python projects. Additionally, it presents practical examples and performance benchmarks to illustrate the benefits of implementing caching techniques in order to optimize code execution and resource management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IME CPU caches can be observed in almost all languages, regardless of how detached they are from the machine. What I'm really wondering is, if branch prediction can be observed from interpreted code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mechanical sympathy" effects are so strong on modern CPUs you feel them even in languages like Python that are far from the metal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't see why you wouldn't expect to find cache-sensitivity in Python, or in some other similarly high-level language.Python sequences are defined as "support[ing] efficient element access using integer indices" [1]. Python lists are sequences and thus must support random access. In practice that means the implementation is a (dynamically resizing) array allocated contiguously. That means spatial locality is relevant.If the list type were defined simply as an iterable collection, with no requirement of constant-time random access, the definition would be abstract enough that an implementation might end up being something else than a contiguous array. But if you define the type so that it supports constant-time random access [2], you pretty much end up with cache-friendly sequential access as well.If you don't define the list type as supporting random access, you also sacrifice asymptotic algorithmic efficiency for lookups by index. Any language that cares about efficiency at all separates collections that support efficient random access from those that don't. (For example, Python has lists and dicts/sets for different access patterns. The Java standard library has separate types for contiguous arrays/lists, hashtable-backed collections and tree-backed collections because the three have different algorithmic efficiencies for different access patterns. In practice it leads to different properties in terms of cache-friendliness as well.)[1] https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence[2] As usual, the Python documentation is a bit vague on the details. It doesn't really say random access has to be constant-time, only that it has to be "efficient". So you might be able to have a non-constant time implementation such as an indexable skiplist while arguing that it's efficient, but you'd have to go out of your way to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555110</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you stress test small address ranges around each failing address, does that selectively heat up the chip to which that address routes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, the reason the address-&gt;IC mapping is non-trivial is for performance reasons.If you were, for example, iterating over a column of a 2D array with a stride equal to some power of two, you'd end up hitting the same IC repeatedly. This limits your bandwidth to that of a single IC, rather than balancing it over all of them. (I'm simplifying a little, but that's the gist)So they try to "swizzle" things, using a formula like the one in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not loading for me, but here's the archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20250207044221/https://blog.pier...On 80's arcade games and home computers you can try piggybacking a known working RAM chip onto each of the RAMs for a quick diagnosis, if you're lucky (it doesn't always work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43554789</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of configuration complexity in the context of computer systems and how it can affect performance and reliability. It highlights the importance of understanding and managing complexity to ensure systems function effectively. The author uses the analogy of a clock to illustrate how components interact, emphasizing that just like a clock, systems can become overly complicated if not designed thoughtfully. The article also addresses strategies to mitigate complexity, advocating for simplicity and clarity in system design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For python apps (whether we should use python for apps is another question completely) my preferred config language is python.A little config.py file gets imported by everything in the project. It contains nothing but assignments to config variables. No functions. Nothing dragged in from a file. Just variable assignments.It's easy to understand, easy to update, and everyone understands this much python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This ("the rule of least power") is a rule I abide by religiously:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_powerI build lots of DSLs/configuration languages but Im pretty militant about killing them if requirements dictate a need for anything resembling loops or conditionals. Those are the the klaxon warning bells telling you that you should just be writing code/a library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tend to do a lot of data-oriented programming, including at the meta-programming level, which blends with the problem of configuration. A pattern I found that works well this use case and covers the whole clock is the following:- DSL as functions T, args* -&gt; T, where T is your configuration type — or, as I like to call it, a plan. Since under function composition it's insensitive to composition order (associativity of the monoid), you can layer DSL functions on top of each other freely.- Literal values as implicit functions. Once the plan is built and before it is run/compiled/interpreted, I cast any literal value in the datatype to a function returning that value. It's a design principle that allows me to hard-code behavior when a literal value is not enough by just swapping it with a lambda.- Once this kind of homogeneity is ensured, and given the points above, I can extend my DSL and the behavior it describes with point-free function combinators. I get conditionals, advanced composition (parallelism for instance) , instrumentation (debugging), etc... without burdening my DSL with ad-hoc, invasive implementations. More importantly I can reuse these facilities across DSLs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:07:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555760</guid></item><item><title>32.

Why look bad having your military run Guantanamo when you can do the Uber model it for a cheap price.Heh, or is a pun on AirBnB the more apt name for it.. "Concrete Floor &amp; Indefinite Detention"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across this article[1] the other day, after reading about the US sending people to a prison in El Salvador and wondering what we actually know about the place.An incongruity that I didn't notice at the time but realized a bit later is that the prison is called "The Center for Terrorism Confinement" and it has a capacity of 40,000 people.  Why would El Salvador or any country need a terrorist detention facility that holds 40,000 people?According to wikipedia, El Salvador has a population of about 6 million.The United States famously kept people accused of terrorism charges at Guantanamo Bay, and 780 prisoners have been kept there over the last couple decades since GWB established the prison.  There are currently 15.Presumably there are a lot more people who would fit the description "domestic terrorist" being held in jails in mainland US, but certainly not 40,000 of them.Presumably president Bukele's administration is using it as a detention facility for regular criminals as well, but it wouldn't be surprising if there's a lot of people there that shouldn't be in jail in the first place.[1] https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/americas/el-salvador-prison-t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point you have a better chance of being freed from this prison camp being a citizen of any other nation than the US which is sending people there without giving them a chance to prove that they are innocent or a citizen of the United States.At least another nation will do whatever they can to get you home unlike the US that just doesn't care. "We made a mistake but we don't care. Nothing we can do." Truly abhorrent especially when the US can do so much to get someone if they really want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:18 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43588970</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know the craziest thing about watching this as an outsider in Canada is that we as a nation are losing one reliable trading partner (and obviously losing an ally but that's another conversation). Germany - losing a trade partner. Japan? And so on. But the US has lost 180 reliable trading partners. You're already seeing in the first week burgeoning trade alliances between nations who wouldn't have cooperated before, and the amount of resentment against America from this is going to take a generation to heal.Of course I'm sure some people would claim this is 4D chess or what not but.. sometimes the person doing something crazy is just crazy at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was looking at used cars on Carmax about two or three weeks ago. I looked again today. They're another $1-2k.This is the shareholder/political class trying to eat their cake and have it too. Pay people a stagnant wage for 40 years while taking most of the surplus value and dedicating it to equities, then pretend to do something about it, but in a way that passes the buck to the people who have been making a stagnant wage so that the wealthy don't incur actual losses.Share prices will be brought back up through layoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not going to comment on the politics, but I'd point out that recession odds on Kalshi are currently 64% and 58% on Polymarket [1,2].  In other words, recession in 2025 is more likely than not -- though far from guaranteed.My thought relevant to HN is that either way this is likely to decimate venture capital and startups, at least in the short run.  Venture capital funds come from limited partners like pensions and endowments, and the professionals I know are all shifting away from growth stocks and into value, international and bonds.  VC is already in a drought (except for AI) and now my guess is that it's going to get worse.  So many VCs I know have started only in the last 15 years, so they have never seen a real recession like 2009 while working in venture.[1] https://kalshi.com/markets/kxrecssnber/recession[2] https://polymarket.com/event/us-recession-in-2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589231</guid></item><item><title>37.

    2) jump thru needlessly complicated hoops (that become ever-moving goalposts for small biz and end users).
    3) wait weeks-&gt;months then GOTO 2 again. And again.

The end result is more and more biz, MNVOs, orgs, etc are abandoning SMS. Trying to comply with TCR is too big a resource-sink for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're looking for a way to programmatically get messages to your phone I recommend Pushover. It's reasonably priced ($5 one time purchase for individuals) and it's run by a solo dev.https://pushover.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, yikes. I’ve come to rely on the email-&gt;sms gateway from AT&amp;T. I’ve had they set up a s a forwarding address within my web mail for a few years now, and have filters which forward matching messages as SMS to my phone.The formatting is often quite lousy but it’s enough to send me a nudge to check my email for a message from the library, a job I applied for, or whatever.I wouldn’t have heard about this about it being posted here, so thank you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589523</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built something similar a few years ago, but using a Pi instead of an Arduino. Reading through the poster's calculations brought back memories of debugging my own orbital mechanics code at 2am while questioning all my life choices.What impresses me most here isn't just the technical achievement, but how the project transforms abstract data into physical movement. We've become so accustomed to viewing everything through screens that there's something deeply satisfying about a physical object that silently points to a spacecraft traveling 28,000 km/h overhead with humans inside.The mathematical transformation from TLE to actual motor positioning is non-trivial - converting between reference frames always seems straightforward on paper until you're debugging at 3am wondering why your arrow is pointing at the ground. I appreciate that they shared actual code rather than glossing over the hard parts.For anyone wanting to build this: from my experience, the hardest part is actually the mechanical design. Getting smooth movement without backlash in consumer-grade steppers and servos takes patience. The 28BYJ-48 is a good budget choice but has noticeable "slop" in its gearing, which can make precise pointing challenging.This reminds me of those old mechanical orreries that modeled the solar system. There's something profoundly human about building machines that help us comprehend the cosmos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering the degree to which an equatorial mount would have simplified the code (made more complex the set-up of the mount).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool! TIL that pencil lead can be a lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593956</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the book discuss capacitive vs resistive touchscreens?At the time you basically had two choices for touchscreens: resistive or capacitive.   Resistive was "obviously" the way to go because it was far more accurate.   Choosing capacitive was inspired -- when used with stubby fingers the accuracy problem was moot, and it allowed multi-touch.Just before the iPhone came out I was fairly confident I knew what the future was.   It was now possible to create a phone with the horsepower to run a real web browsers.  800x600 pixel screens were available which would display normal web pages nicely, and a resistive touch screen with a stylus would make them useful.Then the iPhone came out.  320x480 screen meant normal web pages wouldn't display properly, inaccurate touchscreen meant tap targets needed to be increased massively.    Why would anybody buy an iPhone which didn't allow you to install apps, and the web was unusable because it required rewriting every page since existing pages were unusable.   Instead you could buy a phone which allowed you to install apps and which allowed you to usably access the web.   Obviously the iPhone would be a failure.  :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty similar to the Japanese "flick" keyboard that's fairly commonly used on smartphones. Instead of 3 possible directions per button there's 5 (up, left, right, down, and neutral): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5UEsHEZWIIIt's pretty intuitive because Japanese kana is a syllabary that's organized by their starting consonant and one of five possible vowels in the Gojuon system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABonI never got used to it but people who use it swear by it. Google even made a mechanical version for an April Fools a few years back: https://youtu.be/5LI1PysAlkU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, i always think "i wish there was a demo" of each iterative step on these kind of design journeys. And especially the iOS keyboard, as i thought a lot about it. Awesome that you made this.I really like their idea to make the touch keyboard work well by increasing the (invisible) "padding" area for the key most likely to be typed next. So obvious in hindsight but demos like your's show part of the journey.There are rumors that in the beginning they tried the ipod wheel as the user input interface.While working on my device, that idea is super motivating. I know where i am headed and have done a lot of work and really got something very, very interesting already. But a few parts are yet not clear at all. But, i am definitely further than our "clickwheel" stage. Not yet at the "secret padding" stage for some input ideas, but still.In case you are free and interested to loosely talk about ideas or feedback you have for a very novel device (and interface), please let me know how to reach out. Just because you made this demo, i feel we'd get a long &amp; i can learn a lot from you. And this might be a very interesting challenge for someone like you. Anyway, great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:08:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595442</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observational bias is interesting.  For example, if you judge by the stars visible to the naked eye, you get a very different sense of the distribution of stellar masses than if you use a telescope, because no class M main sequence stars will be included (the brightest has apparent magnitude 6.7).  The intrinsically brightest stars, including many of the famously named ones, are visible to great distances and so are very overrepresented.The most spectacular form of observational bias could be the presence of life.  The planet we are on will always have life (because, we are here and we are life) regardless of how uncommon life actually is in the universe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:08 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43591866</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been following Voyager since the late 70s when my dad (who worked at Ames) would bring home printouts of the Jupiter images. This interview captures something profound about these missions that non-space folks often miss.The most striking part isn't the technical achievement of keeping 1970s hardware alive for half a century. It's the human infrastructure behind it - the institutional knowledge passed through generations of engineers like some ancient priesthood maintaining a temple.Think about it: We're teaching 2020s engineers to understand machine code written before MS-DOS existed, working with 50 year old documentation on yellowing paper, and bringing retirees back to decipher systems they built when Nixon was president.Our space exploration legacy is being maintained by the engineering equivalent of oral history. This is why we need consistent funding for these long-term missions - the value isn't just in the data, but in maintaining the unbroken chain of knowledge transfer that makes missions like this possible.The sticky notes on diagrams trying to revive a silent probe 15 billion miles away just broke me. This is humanity at its finest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time this topic comes up on HN, I always like to remind readers about the following:One of my favorite facts ever is that Voyager 1 contains something called the Voyager Golden Record [1]. It has the following quote written:This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.I get chills every time I think about this.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; silicaFor anyone else curious, it's from the hydrazine tank's rubber diaphragm. Tubes inside the thrusters, which direct fuel to the catalyst beds, had openings taken from 250 um diameter down to 35 um.[1]The 28" spherical tank[2] has a rubber hemisphere to separate hydrazine from pressurant (He? N?). The diaphragm is EDPM that's teflon and silica filled.[3] The silica particles are for (tensile?) strengthening. It has a leaching issue (discussed in [2] page17).PSI was a small SoCal company.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of a "fifth kind of optimization," which goes beyond traditional optimization strategies employed in various fields. It discusses how this new layer involves not just maximizing efficiency or effectiveness, but also encompasses ethical considerations, sustainability, and the impact of decisions on society and the environment. The author emphasizes the importance of integrating these broader values into optimization processes to create solutions that are not only effective but also socially responsible and sustainable for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555311"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every large scale cloud/SaaS software has been using parallelism for decades [well, almost two decades give or take]. Requests run in parallel on millions of servers and one server processes many requests in parallel.In that sort of setup the old school optimize one program by doing things in parallel is somewhat less relevant because everything by its nature is massively parallel and complex operations are often broken down into bits that all run in parallel. In that sort of environment over-parallelizing can actually be a pessimization because there is often some cost around breaking the work up to run in parallel and your little bit of this massively parallel system may have some fraction of resources anyways.Not to say there's no value in knowing "old school" parallelizing (including using SIMD or GPUs or whatnot) but for many types of applications that's not where I'd focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somehow his taxonomy of optimizations doesn't have a category for things like "unroll a loop", "fuse loops", "block your array accesses", "avoid false sharing", or "strength-reduce your operations".  He has a "use a better algorithm" category, but his example is switching from bubble sort to selection sort, which is a much more disruptive kind of change than such micro-optimizations, which are usually considered to be "the same algorithm".This is rather puzzling, given that he starts off with, "Premature optimisation might be the root of all evil, but", quoting Knuth, and in context, Knuth was primarily talking about precisely such micro-optimizations: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/356635.356640 p. 267 (p. 7/41)Specifically, the optimizations Knuth was exhibiting in that section of the paper are:- speeding up a sequential array search by copying the search key to an empty spot at the end of the array, so that the loop only requires one termination test (are keys equal?) rather than two (are keys equal? is index in bounds?), speeding it up on typical machines of the time by 50%;- unrolling that version of the loop 2× in a way that required gotos, speeding it up by a further 12%.None of the optimization techniques being applied there fit into any of Tratt’s categories!Now, I can't claim to be any sort of optimization expert, but I think these kinds of micro-optimizations are still important, though, as Knuth pointed out at the time, not for all code, and often the drawbacks are not worth it.  Sometimes compilers will save you.  The C compiler might unroll a loop for you, for example.  But often it won't, and it certainly isn't going to pull something like the sentinel trick, because it doesn't know you aren't reading the array in another thread.This sort of depends on what context you're working in; arguably if your hotspots are in Python, even (as Tratt says) in PyPy, you have bigger opportunities for optimization available than manually unrolling a loop to reduce loop termination tests.  But I've found that there's often something available in that sort of grungy tweaking; I've frequently been able to double the speed of Numpy code, for example, by specifying the output array for each Numpy operation, thus reducing the cache footprint.  The code looks like shit afterwards, sadly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s also ‘don’t do it’ ( just turn the whole thing off because it’s actually not needed ) and ‘use a better middleman’ ( os, compiler etc while not going lower level). In my experience these are very cheap and usually not looked at and most devs jump at the other 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555311</guid></item><item><title>43. 404s – gallery of error 404 page designs</title><link>https://www.404s.design/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various database protocols and their importance in ensuring efficient data management and integrity within distributed systems. It outlines different types of protocols, such as two-phase commit and consensus algorithms, explaining how they help in synchronizing transactions across multiple nodes to maintain consistency. The piece emphasizes the trade-offs between performance, reliability, and complexity, providing insights into the selection and implementation of appropriate protocols for specific application needs. Overall, the article serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the fundamental concepts and challenges associated with database protocols in modern applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593547"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title says Database Protocols, but the author writes only about MySQL and Postgres. There are other databases out there, for example Oracle that I’m the most familiar with and it has had a break/reset mechanism built in to its protocol for at least 30 years [1]. Its a 2 step operation (2 roundtrips), one sending an error back to the client instead of the expected result and the second step will reset “current call” (not current session or connection) state on the server side and then request the client do the same.Databases/protocols that differentiate between connection, session and call scopes, can reliably perform resets without requiring to tear down the entire connection.Retrying is safe with no client side transaction idempotency tokens needed, as the error handling will roll back any changes done only by the failed call, not the entire transaction or session.[1]: https://tanelpoder.com/2008/04/10/sqlnet-breakreset-to-clien...Edit: added the comment about retry and idempotency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postgres does have "reset" support.There are several ways commands depending on what you want to reset. If you're only interested in mutable state changeable with SET, you can use RESET ALL instead. This resets configuration settings such as the time zone, statement timeout, and so on.Postgres has different fine-grained ways to reset other aspects of a session, such as closing cursors (CLOSE ALL), unlistening from notifications (UNLISTEN), deallocating prepared plans (DEALLOCATE), and so on. Finally, there's DISCARD ALL, which resets everything.I agree about error handling. Most clients just disconnect on a connection error.One gotcha about Postgres queries is that running queries do not get cancelled when the client disconnects. This has always been a weird one that's quite dangerous, as it can lead to dog-piling — if a client starts a slow query, then times out or cancels its connection, the query lives on; then if another identical request starts, same thing happens, and soon you have 100 queries running that are doing the same thing and getting slower and slower. You have to be very careful with retrying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most these issues seem specific to, and created by, the impedance mismatch between ORMs (like ActiveRecord) and databases.To work correctly, application code must be aware of transactions, and be prepared to roll back state and safely retry a transaction on failure.ORMs like ActiveRecord struggle to do this because they attempt to present a transactional database as a low-friction, in-memory, mutable, non-transactional data model that does not support rollback.If you lose a connection to the database prior to successfully committing your transaction, this is just another form of transaction failure.You need to discard any pending application state changes, open a new connection and transaction, requery data required to determine the actual current state, and then if necessary, retry your transaction.ActiveRecord can’t do that, hence the ill-advised desire to be able to automatically retry statements on failure — which abandons database-mediated transaction isolation, and incorrectly shifts responsibility for database state preservation/management to the client.If SQL was trivially idempotent, we wouldn’t need transactions or different levels of transaction isolation in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593547</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Soul of an Old Machine" explores the emotional and nostalgic connections people have with vintage technology, particularly old computers and devices. It delves into how these machines are often viewed not just as tools, but as carriers of memories and experiences, reflecting the intersection of humanity and technology. The piece also discusses the cultural significance of reviving and maintaining these machines, highlighting the artistry and craftsmanship involved in their design and the stories they tell about past eras.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the story, after troubleshooting various timing and layout issues he left a note on his terminal:  "I'm going to a commune in Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite books by my favorite author. Tracy Kidder gets to the heart of everyone he profiles like no other. Strongly recommend his book House if you like Soul of a New Machine.Funny anecdote: I've read Soul of a new machine many times over the years, and love it dearly. I stayed with my aunt and uncle last year and somehow the topic of mini computers came up. I mentioned Soul of a New Machine and my uncle said "oh yeah I worked on that computer." I was blown away. Apparently he had worked at Data General and he was on the software team (which is briefly mentioned towards the end of the book) that wrote the software the Eagle was released with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love books about writing/creating new software/hardware. One I can recommend, about Windows NT is: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Windows-Gene...Does anyone here know about any book(s) on the VAX, or indeed on any of DEC's machines, or IBM's stuff (which were - probably still are - beautifully engineered) come to that? I'm aware of "Big Blue", but that is mostly about IBM business practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:09:58 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555474</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses operational security (opsec) considerations for travelers crossing borders with cell phones. It emphasizes the importance of protecting personal data and mitigating risks of surveillance or data theft. Key recommendations include minimizing sensitive data on devices, using strong passwords, enabling encryption, and being cautious about disclosing information to border authorities. The author highlights that while it’s legal for authorities to inspect devices, travelers should be aware of their rights and take proactive measures to safeguard their information.&lt;/p&gt;

I was recently able to pick it up again. From an inquiry with my lawyer, the following emerged: The authorities tried to read the device with both UFED4PC and Cellebrite Premium Touch. In addition, software from other forensic providers was used without success. The software did not succeed in breaking the system. The device was in BFU mode and had a 30-digit PIN. USB port was deactivated. As of March 2025, I can therefore say that it is not possible for Cellebrite to break a secured GrapheneOS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a modern iPhone and don’t want the crazy hacks, a very very simple but effective tip is to power off your iPhone when exiting the aircraft. When the device powers up it is in “before first unlock” mode and is severely restricted in what it can do. The attack surface area is significantly reduced. They’re not going to burn one of their $100,000 per install exploits on your BFU phone the same way they do with a full physical access unlocked paid exploit.Also lockdown mode to reduce attack surface area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of article makes me sad, as why should we live in a world where we (or at least some people) need to even think about this.. maybe I woke up this morning in a foul mood, but honestly, the idea of even having to think about burner phones and "opsec" for traveling (or even just living) depresses me to the point where I will probably not do it at all, and if things go sour, I just accept my fate. Similar to the prepping advice currently given by the scaremongering news in the EU... (Have water, and an emergency radio!!).Anyone else feel like this? I simply do not have any desire to live in a world where this kind of behavior is required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:28 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555597</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As LLMs do things thought to be impossible before, LeCun adjusts his statements about LLMs, but at the same time his credibility goes lower and lower. He started saying that LLMs were just predicting words using a probabilistic model, like a better Markov Chain, basically. It was already pretty clear that this was not the case as even GPT3 could do summarization well enough, and there is no probabilistic link between the words of a text and the gist of the content, still he was saying that at the time of GPT3.5 I believe. Then he adjusted this vision when talking with Hinton publicly, saying "I don't deny there is more than just probabilistic thing...". He started saying: not longer just simply probabilistic but they can only regurgitate things they saw in the training set, often explicitly telling people that novel questions could NEVER solved by LLMs, with examples of prompts failing at the time he was saying that and so forth. Now reasoning models can solve problems they never saw, and o3 did huge progresses on ARC, so he adjusted again: for AGI we will need more. And so forth.So at this point it does not matter what you believe about LLMs: in general, to trust LeCun words is not a good idea. Add to this that LeCun is directing an AI lab that as the same point has the following huge issues:1. Weakest ever LLM among the big labs with similar resources (and smaller resources: DeepSeek).2. They say they are focusing on open source models, but the license is among the less open than the available open weight models.3. LLMs and in general all the new AI wave puts CNNs, a field where LeCun worked (but that didn't started himself) a lot more in perspective, and now it's just a chapter in a book that is composed mostly of other techniques.Btw, other researchers that were in the LeCun side, changed side recently, saying that now "is different" because of CoT, that is the symbolic reasoning they were blabling before. But CoT is stil regressive next token without any architectural change, so, no, they were wrong, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent talk:

(Why autoregressive models suck)https://xcancel.com/ravi_mohan/status/1906612309880930641&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idolatry and drama surrounding LeCun, Hinton, Schmidhuber, etc. is likely a distraction. This includes their various predictions.More interesting is their research work. JEPA is what LeCun is betting on:https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-jo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:38 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562768</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a clear pattern to the madness. First make up something unsubstantiated by fact. Two declare it a crisis that requires acting without congress and circumventing existing laws. Three destroy something that will take generations to repair, if it can be repaired. Four repeat with something else so quickly that people forget the last few things destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Emergency” my ass. More like made up crap to bully Canada by orange buffoon who hates trees as much as windmills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This executive action blames forest management for increased wildfires, but the IPCC has predicted this exact problem for decades. Unsurprisingly, climate change is not mentioned.I guess we’re to believe that forests are being poorly managed by every government in every country around the world?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:10:48 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589321</guid></item></channel></rss>
