            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dang, I was hoping this might be something cool about graphs in the Lean language/theorem prover.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn’t use a tree to depict a DAG.While technically true, it’s not the first thing that comes to mind when you think about DAGs. And in the context of the Product Management, I would’ve split it into Trees and DAGs.E.g. a tree is when you recursively subdivide tasks into smaller ones, where at the leaves you have a ready for execution tickets. While DAGs are more like workflows or pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42843817</guid></item><item><title>50.

Until we get value based pricing for zero days, we will never be safe from the real threats.We really should be funding exploit teams to break everything they can so that we have secure infrastructure.&gt; Two months later, during the Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024 competition, ZDI awarded another $1,132,500 for 29 zero-day bugs. Synacktiv went home with $200,000 and a Tesla Model 3 after hacking its ECU with Vehicle (VEH) CAN BUS Control in under 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The name Pwn2Own is quite ironic. Who really owns their vehicle nowadays?I hope these security efforts don't lock legitimate owners out of access to their vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you start this line of work? I think I am pretty versed in many security topics and I "think" I would see (some) vulnerabilities in systems, but I don't know where to start. Do you just "pick a target" and start digging?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42817260</guid></item><item><title>1.

As an example, aider currently writes about 70% of the new code in each of its releases.I automatically track and share this stat as graph [0] with aider's release notes.Before Sonnet, most releases were less than 20% AI generated code. With Sonnet, that jumped to &gt;50%. For the last few months, about 70% of the new code in each release is written by aider. The record is 82%.Folks often ask which models I use to code aider, so I automatically publish those stats too [1]. I've been shifting more and more of my coding from Sonnet to DeepSeek V3 in recent weeks. I've been experimenting with R1, but the recent API outages have made that difficult.[0] https://aider.chat/HISTORY.html[1] https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#what-llms-do-you-use-to-bui...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given these initial results, I'm now experimenting with running DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B for some coding tasks on my laptop via Ollama - their version of that needs about 20GB of RAM on my M2. https://www.ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:32bIt's impressive!I'm finding myself running it against a few hundred lines of code mainly to read its chain of thought - it's good for things like refactoring where it will think through everything that needs to be updated.Even if the code it writes has mistakes, the thinking helps spot bits of the code I may have otherwise forgotten to look at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who aren't tempted to click through, the buried lede for this (and why I'm glad it's being linked to again today) is that "99% of the code in this PR [for llama.cpp] is written by DeekSeek-R1" as conducted by Xuan-Son Nguyen.That seems like a notable milestone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42852866</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An 80% size reduction is no joke, and the fact that the 1.58-bit version runs on dual H100s at 140 tokens/s is kind of mind-blowing. That said, I’m still skeptical about how practical this really is for most people. Like, yeah, you can run it on 24GB VRAM or even with just 20GB RAM, but "slow" is an understatement—those speeds would make even the most patient person throw their hands up.And then there’s the whole repetition issue. Infinite loops with "Pygame’s Pygame’s Pygame’s" kind of defeats the point of quantization if you ask me. Sure, the authors have fixes like adjusting the KV cache or using min_p, but doesn’t that just patch a symptom rather than solve the actual problem? A fried model is still fried, even if it stops repeating itself.On the flip side, I love that they’re making this accessible on Hugging Face... and the dynamic quantization approach is pretty brilliant. Using 1.58-bit for MoEs and leaving sensitive layers like down_proj at higher precision—super clever. Feels like they’re squeezing every last drop of juice out of the architecture, which is awesome for smaller teams who can’t afford OpenAI-scale hardware."accessible" still comes with an asterisk. Like, I get that shared memory architectures like a 192GB Mac Ultra are a big deal, but who’s dropping $6,000+ on that setup? For that price, I’d rather build a rig with used 3090s and get way more bang for my buck (though, yeah, it’d be a power hog). Cool tech—no doubt—but the practicality is still up for debate. Guess we'll see if the next-gen models can address some of these trade-offs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random observation 1: I was running DeepSeek yesterday on my Linux with a RTX 4090 and I noticed that the models should fit into VRAM, which is 24GB. Or they are simply slow. So the Apple shared memory architecture has an advantage here. A 192GB Mx Ultra can load and process large models efficiently.Random observation 2: It's time to cancel the OpenAI subscription.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, an 80% reduction in size for DeepSeek-R1 is just amazing! It's fantastic to see such large models becoming more accessible to those of us who don't have access to top-tier hardware. This kind of optimization opens up so many possibilities for experimenting at home.I'm impressed by the 140 tokens per second speed with the 1.58-bit quantization running on dual H100s. That kind of performance makes the model practical for small or mid sized shops to use it for local applications. This is a huge win for people working on agents that require low latency that only local models could support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42850222</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their SLAP demo provides a great example of how defence-in-depth can make/break the viability of an exploit. That terrifying Safari demo is possible because Safari fails to isolate new windows in individual processes when calling `window.open` in js.All the other side channel magic presented here doesn't matter if the data you want to read is in a seperate process with sufficient separation from the "hostile" process in the address space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool detail, in the section where they reverse-engineer the presence of an LVP on the M3:    Remarkably, while all other load widths activate the LVP
    on any constant value fitting that width, we observe that acti-
    vation on 8-byte wide loads occurs only when the load value
    is zero. We conjecture that this may be a countermeasure for
    memory safety such that the LVP will not learn values of
    pointers. That is, with the M3 being a 64-bit CPU, pointers
    are 8 bytes wide. Furthermore, on 64-bit macOS executables,
    any virtual address below 0x100, 000, 000 is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm, one part i found interesting&gt; In order to make cache hits distinguishable from misses
in Safari, we reference the NOT gate-based cache amplifica-
tion primitive from [29, Section 5], adjusting the speculation
parameters for the M2 CPU. We run the amplifier 500 times
when the target address is cached and 500 more times when
it is evicted, in native and WebAssembly implementations.
Table 3 summarizes the timing distributions, with units in
ms. We observe that they are clearly separable even in a
web environment, allowing us to distinguish cache hits from
misses with WebKit’s 1 ms timer.So i guess all the hub hub around disabling fine resolution timers and SharedArrayBuffer was for naught.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42856023</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;Desmos is an online graphing calculator and mathematics platform that provides tools for visualizing and exploring mathematical concepts. It allows users to plot graphs, create interactive simulations, and solve equations, making it a valuable resource for students and educators. The platform also offers a variety of educational activities and lessons, enhancing the learning experience in mathematics at various levels. Desmos promotes engagement with math through its user-friendly interface and dynamic visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used Desmos quite a bit as an instructional tool for high school math. They are funded through relationships with several companies, but most notably the standardized testing industry, which uses it with their online tests.Over ten years before Desmos launched, there began an open source project called Geogebra (https://www.geogebra.org/). Geogebra remains open source to this day and offers a similar suite of applications and calculators, both online and in app form.Over the years I have also used Geogebra as an instructional tool in both my math and physics classrooms, producing dozens of apps, simulators, and gizmos: https://www.geogebra.org/u/mrdathhsGeogebra excels at creating mathematical simulations. One of my favorites was this real-time satellite orbit calculator: https://www.geogebra.org/m/UEynuRnG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish I could get a dedicated handheld graphing calculator that hasn't had most of the functionality removed due to standardized testing.  We live in an age of miracles but having a decent solver on a dedicated device is apparently commercially impossible because it couldn't be sold to students.I'm just a dude in my shop that occasionally would like to integrate a thing or two without getting coolant on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High school students taking the digital SAT get near-full access to Desmos throughout the math portion of the test (it’s a modified version, but you get access to practically everything). It’s very powerful, and if you can use it effectively, you can brute force hard questions in seconds. Graphing calculators have been available during the SAT in the past, but Desmos is something else… I wonder how it effects score distributions/question difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42816133</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the "Machine Learning in Practice" course at Carnegie Mellon University for the Spring 2025 semester. It outlines the course goals, objectives, and structure, emphasizing hands-on experience with various machine learning techniques. The site includes details about the syllabus, assignments, and evaluation criteria, as well as resources for students to enhance their learning. There is a focus on collaboration and practical applications, preparing students to apply machine learning concepts in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The material is definitely practical—Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins are all industry-standard tools, and the focus on MLOps is refreshing. It’s great to see a course bridge the gap between ML and actual production systems, not just stop at building models. Love that they're also tackling explainability, fairness, and monitoring. These are the things that often get overlooked in practice.Is it too entry-level? Looking at the labs, a lot of this seems like stuff a mid-level software engineer (or even a motivated beginner) could pick up on their own with tutorials. Git, Flask, container orchestration... all useful, but pretty basic for anyone who's already worked in production environments. The deeper challenges—like optimizing networking for distributed training or managing inference at scale—don’t seem to get as much attention. Maybe it comes up in the group projects?Also wondering about the long-term relevance of some of the tools they’re using. Jenkins? Sure, it’s everywhere, but wouldn’t it make sense to introduce something more modern like GitHub Actions or ArgoCD for CI/CD? Same with Kubernetes—obviously a must-know, but what about alternatives or supplementary tools for edge deployments or serverless systems? Feels like an opportunity to push into the future a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to have very little on Data Quality and it is on Chapter 16...How much practical experience in Industry do the authors have? Because 90% of your time will be spent on Data Quality and Data Cleansing...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there somewhere I could follow along with other non students?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42847834</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against GoDaddy, alleging that the company failed to maintain adequate data security for its website hosting services, which led to significant breaches affecting customer information. The FTC claims that GoDaddy's lax security measures allowed unauthorized individuals to access sensitive data, including personal information of customers. This enforcement action is part of the FTC's broader initiative to ensure that companies take necessary precautions to safeguard consumer data and uphold strong cybersecurity practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing that (approximately) no one cares about stuff like this.GoDaddy was severely breached several times over several years, yet they still rake in billions of revenue from their millions of customers. Now they have to pay someone to fill out a biennial checklist and... promise to not lie. Awesome.If you own a company, why even bother with security? Security is expensive. Wait until a breach is exposed, offer $10 credit monitoring (at best), accept the free press coverage, maybe pinky promise to not lie if you've been particularly egregious in your handling of multiple incidents, and then carry on like normal. (This is tongue-in-cheek, I work in security, but I am frustrated with how often stories like this one occur)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GoDaddy is one of the sleaziest companies I know of.I ran a website hosted on GoDaddy for a local business when the server cluster was hacked. GoDaddy admitted it was their fault, but the business ended up having to pay me to fix the site. GoDaddy also managed to convince the business to pay for an additional monthly "security" plan, which included page caching. They set everything up over the phone without talking to me at all.The next day I notice some odd behavior with the admin pages, then realize they're being cached, not only that but they're now publicly accessible. GoDaddy's improved security plan ended up being responsible for a data leak. They really screwed up twice but there was zero penalty, the only consequence was they made more money. The business chose to stay with GoDaddy, despite my recommendations. They saw the ads on TV and were convinced GoDaddy is the pinnacle of web hosting.Also, check this out: https://www.butterflyave.com/Those assholes have parked my old business name, and want to sell it back to me for $1,499.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SendGrid, pre IPO, had a GoDaddy security incident: someone social engineered one of the GoDaddy support reps into giving them control of our domain. We were able to re-secure the domain before the attacker fully locked us out. They could have powned all of our email links.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42849632</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces that researchers from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) have confirmed the existence of a "super-Earth" located in the habitable zone of a nearby star. This exoplanet, which is larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, is positioned in an area where conditions may support liquid water, making it a candidate for potential life. The discovery adds to the growing understanding of where habitable planets may exist beyond our solar system, highlighting the importance of ongoing astronomical research and observations.&lt;/p&gt;

Super excited to see what data it brings back to us.The telescope is called PLATO ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(spacecraft) )I contributed to the project a few years back, very happy to answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let me remind you guys that "just 20 light years" = roughly 200 trillion kms. At the speed of voyager 1, it takes roughly 1600 yrs to travel 1 trillion kms. 200 trillion kms would take 320,000 years to reach there. Even if you increased the speed of voyager 1 by 10 times, it would still take 32000 years to reach. We really need to up the speed by a factor of 10000 before we can get anywhere close to human lifetime achievable travel times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The existence of the Super-earth was not directly observed, but was instead inferred by the gravitational lensing of all the democracy[0] being spread in a sphere around the planet.[0] https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Earth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853174</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty cool design, I am not sure if some boards are unsolvable or if I suck though. Some hints:  * It works similar to minesweeper so hints/patters for minesweeper also applies. 
 https://minesweeper.online/help/patterns
  * Prefer levelling up to heal over the hearts. You can use hearts later for bigger heals
  * Don't level up unless needed to. Try to hit 0 heart before levelling up.
  * Point is exploring as much as possible
  * You can use right mouse button to mark cells with numbers or X (for mine). If you figure out a cell don't open it unless you want to explore that area. If not just mark them and leave them. Later when you need to heal/level up, you can kill those marked cells for extra XP with no cost since the health you have will be wasted anyway.
  * While picking up hearts again prefer the ones that in areas you want to explore into
  * To make things easier, at the beginning you can just open random cells that are far away from the orbs. If you die, you won't lose much :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since I couldn't find a description of the rules anywhere:- Spaces contain monsters of various levels (numbers) and cause your character to lose that amount of HP when clicked. They drop the same amount of gold which you use to level up.- Leveling up fully heals you and you gain 1 max HP- You'll need to explore the map beating enough low level monsters to continuously level up while managing your HP. You CAN go to zero HP but not below.- Get to level 15 and defeat the dragon to win the game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of fun with this last week, played 10-20 games. It does reach a point where you can beat every game, I found myself craving an extended version that introduces some new elements.One gripe, the code is incredibly inefficient - my laptop fan was running full speed and battery draining fast, while the game board just sits there with no animations or anything going on. Should be basically using 0% CPU while idle.Anyway really fun concept &amp; execution, and great game design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42812157</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "Slack Overflow," a phenomenon where excessive communication through platforms like Slack can lead to overwhelming information overload and decreased productivity for teams. It emphasizes the need for establishing clear communication guidelines, setting boundaries around messaging, and utilizing tools and strategies to manage team communication effectively. The piece suggests best practices for reducing the noise in digital communication environments, ensuring that important messages are noticed while minimizing distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

(If I got that right, I think that's part of what is offered here.) Where I work, we have several layers in between engineering and the end users and ... while there's a lot to be said for increasing focus and reducing distractions, I think it's also nice to have the unfiltered contact sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42811146</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of the shebang line in scripts, specifically focusing on the application of the `#!/usr/bin/env uv` shebang. It explains how this ensures that the script utilizes the appropriate version of the UV (Universal Virtual) runtime, providing flexibility in execution across different environments. The article highlights the benefits of using `env` for locating the interpreter, promoting best practices in scripting and environment management, and offers practical examples for users to implement in their own scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, today I learned about env -S - when I saw the shebang line in the article, I immediately thought "that doesn't work on Linux, shebang lines can only pass a single argument". Basically, running foo.py starting with    #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script

causes the OS run really run env with only two arguments, namely the shebang line as one argument and the script's filename as the second argument, i.e.:    /usr/bin/env '-S uv run --script' foo.py

However, the -S flag of env causes env to split everything back into separate arguments! Very cool, very useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not using shebang, but I've recently been using uv as an "installer". It's hard to package and distribute python CLI tools with complex dependencies. I used uv in a couple of novel ways:1. I copied their `curl | sh` install script and added a `uv tool install --python python3.12 my-tool` line at the end. So users can now install my CLI tool with a nice curl-pipe-sh one-liner.2. I made a tiny pypi "installer" package that has "uv" as its only dependency. All it does is  `uv tool install` my CLI tool.Both methods install the CLI tool, python3.12 and all python dependencies in their own isolated environment. Users don't need to manage python virtual envs. They don't need to even have python installed for the curl-pipe-sh method.I now get far fewer GitHub issues from users who have somehow mangled the complex dependencies of my tool.I wrote it up with more detail and links to code:https://aider.chat/2025/01/15/uv.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of funny shebangs, I came up with this to shell execute prolog .pl files, but it should work for any scripting language that has /**/-comments but doesn't support #-comments or #! shebangs specifically:    /*usr/bin/env scryer-prolog "$0" "$@" ; exit #*/

From my original comment https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/issues/2170#issuecomm... :&gt; The way this works is that this test.pl is both a valid shell file and prolog file. When executing as shell the first line finds and executes /usr/bin/env after searching for the glob pattern /*usr/bin/env. env then executes scryer-prolog "test.pl" which runs the prolog file as a module and halts; of course prolog ignores the first line as a comment /* ... */. Then the shell continues and executes the next command after ; which is exit which stops execution so the rest of the file (which is not valid shell) is ignored. The # makes the shell evaluator ignore prolog comment closer */ to prevent it from printing an error.This may be the best and worst thing I have ever created.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42855258</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Martin Kleppmann's presentation at the O'Reilly O'Reilly Developers Conference (Oredev) in 2015, where he explores the inner workings of databases. He emphasizes the importance of understanding database systems, their structures, and the complexities involved in their design and operation. The presentation covers topics such as data models, consistency, scalability, and the trade-offs between different database architectures. Kleppmann aims to provide insights into how databases function internally to help developers make informed decisions when working with data storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We did this style on top of plain MSSQL. Each event would have a SQL table which is the primary storage. Then we have workers that listens to new data in tables and updates projections we needed. (Sometimes DB triggers but mostly async workers.)The main issue is "listening to new data in a SQL table". I wrote this code to achieve it in MSSQL (perhaps it is somehow built into postgres?): https://github.com/vippsas/mssql-changefeedIn my experience this approach is beautiful; as Martins says, our backend code is mostly stateless and functional these days, why have mutable objects in the DB? And the approach is extremely useful for dry-running business logic etcBut we didn't like the prospect of adopting Kafka wholesale. Having all the data in a SQL DB is extremely convenient for debugging, and since we already used SQL it was a smaller change that was done first where it made most sense and then spread out.It would be great with more DB features targeting this style. Explicit partition event tables (kafka-in-SQL), and writing a projection simply as a SQL query which is inverted into an async trigger by the DB would be awesome. (MSSQL has indexed views, but it cannot be done online...)Materialize is the DB I know about in this territory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is also known as event sourcing [0] and is a common pattern used inside of databases, in git, in lots of popular software.I don't generally recommend it for every application as the tooling is not as well integrated as it is in an RDBMS and the data model doesn't fit every use-case.However, if you have a system that needs to know "when" something happened in an on-going process, it can be a very handy architecture... although with data-retention laws it can get tricky quickly (among other reasons).[0] https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing I always get stuck on with these techniques is, how do you handle transactions which perform validations/enforce invariants on data when you’re just writing writes to a log and computing materialized views down the line? How can you do essentially, an “add item to shopping cart” if for example, users can only have max 10 items and so you need to validate that there aren’t already 10 items in the cart?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828720</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear in mind that the placebo effect from DBS for Parkinson's is 39% of the active treatment, so you can't really tell much from a single unblinded patient report.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S13538...Here is a meta-analysis of DBS for Parkinson's: https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/3/1/e000705Principal findings:"All results had a high risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence was very low for all primary outcomes. The information size was insufficient when assessing all cause mortality. Meta-analysis showed that deep brain stimulation increased the risk of serious adverse events, mainly because of an increased risk of perioperative complications, such as cerebral haemorrhages and postoperative confusion, and events related to hardware, such as infection at the stimulator site, dislocation of the device, or reoperations. Meta-analyses indicated that deep brain stimulation might reduce symptoms specific to Parkinson's disease, but the assessments of disease specific symptoms had several methodological limitations."So, it's an interesting treatment, but more evidence is needed before we can conclude that it is actually helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so the short story is - at the moment, the device is basically doing power spectra analysis w/ FFT and such from local field potential recordings, and only turning the device on when it's detecting a strong ~20 hz band.Helps w/ motor symptoms only - does NOT address any dementia/psychosis symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My company makes DBS devices. There are a lot of other possible indications like migraine and others where it could help too but progress is very slow. You can't "move fast and break things" with brain implants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857293</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite fact about raindrop paths/watersheds is that they determine most of the political boundary between Argentina and Chile. If the rain at a point ultimately flows to the Pacific Ocean, that point is in Chile; if it flows to the Atlantic Ocean, it is in Argentina. This is article 1 of the original boundary treaty [0] from the 19th century.The treaty was made before the Andes were fully explored, and so it doesn't handle some interesting edges cases like the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. The field has the property that when rain falls there, it freezes and goes nowhere![0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Treaty_of_1881_betwee...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;VMS was the first multiuser system I used in 1991.  I was amazed that a single computer could have 300 users logged in all doing their own thing.I learned to program in C and tried using  Borland Turbo C on a DOS.  Go outside of the array index and you could easily crash the entire machine which meant reboot and try it again.   I thought the concept of memory protection was incredible!  Why didn't every computer have that?It was the first time I saw email, sending messages, and the phone utility for chatting with other users while waiting for your programs to run in the background.I moved on to an IBM RT running AIX and got hooked on Unix. That's the system I wanted and have been running Linux since 1994.  But VMS still holds a special place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VMS had asynchronous programming to its core. Most system calls could be performed synchronously or async. You just had to give the async call a flag that would indicate when the response was ready. So you could read a file or connect to the network, continue execution and when you actually needed the answer, just sys$wait(flag). Or have callback functions.
It worked extremely well as some else mentioned, 64Mb of RAM was enough to handle 200 interactive users with RDB (database IMO far superior to Oracle that was acquired by them and promptly buried)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first serious (multiuser) system experience was VMS. The concurrency, the power of DCL, the record based nature of files, the mail box concept for process communication, the accounting system, the granular privs, the cluster concept. I came to UNIX second and still miss some of these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42851519</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone, I'm the creator of Malimite.  I actually released this as part of a conference talk at Objective By the Sea, which you can see here:https://youtu.be/vWdKjVCZtTIIt gives a good overview of the development process as well as my motivations for creating it.  The tool will also be on homebrew shortly :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting this year I started learning bunch of security topics and Ghidra is something I started learning. I decompiled some games and getting comfortable how to work a project, teach Ghidra structures etc.Am I right in looking at Malimite here and reading "Built on top of Ghidra decompilation to offer direct support for Swift, Objective-C, and Apple resources." that this is not a Ghidra extension but rather it is using a piece of Ghidra (the decompilation) like a backend? Malimite here is presented as its own piece of software.Asking as a Ghidra noob who doesn't know all the ways Ghidra can be used: Would it make sense for something like this to be a Ghidra extension instead? I.e. give Ghidra some tooling/plugin to understand iOS apps or their languages better, instead of a new app that just uses parts of Ghidra. Also the Malimite screenshot in the page looks similar to Ghidra CodeBrowser tool.Asking because it feels like it could be: from the little I've used Ghidra so far, looks like it is designed to be extendable, scriptable, usable by a team collaborating, etc. And Ghidra seems more holistic than just focusing on decompiling code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(This is LLM-powered and based on Ghidra, fwiw)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829402</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're a 33-year-old small company, with thirty employees. I started the company in 1992 to do custom programming (VB and MS Access) and network support (Novell NetWare). I slowly grew to five employees. In 2000 I did not enjoy billing out our hours, so I decided to develop a product -- a web-based issue tracking application to help with IT support. The transition from a services business to a product business was much more difficult than I anticipated, but we made it. Now Issuetrak is doing fine. From what I read on Hacker News, there are nice aspects to working in a small company. We have no outside investment, so we call our own shots. Everyone is close to the customers. We listen to all team members' ideas. Everyone knows who is contributing. We can work from home. After 25 years of taking customer suggestions, our product is robust. We provide prompt, very good telephone support. We win deals (and lose them too) against competitors that are 400 times our size. One of the biggest satisfactions is that when we survey our customers after each support encounter, it is not unusual to hear them say that Issuetrak is the best software company they've ever dealt with. My salary is probably less than that of many FANG engineers, but life is good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CodeWeavers, which I am very lucky to be part of, is also an (almost) 30-year-old small company! We make Wine, Proton, and CrossOver, you might've heard of them. And I think we are hiring as well, please have a look!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope to be able to write this blog post in 20 years.  My co-founder and I started a bootstrapped company 3 years ago do IaC orchestration and we are slowly but steadily growing.  We love being small.  We love being accountable to our customers.  We love having the freedom to make decisions.  Yes, it's not always easy.  We explicitly don't want to be a billion dollar company.  We want to make a product that serves our niche exactly how they want to be served.  We're definitely making less money than if we worked at another company.  But we feel we can make it to our goal and think we'll be happy when there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42847865</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Toronto have developed a groundbreaking method for creating high-performance nano-architected materials that are as strong as steel yet as lightweight as foam. This innovative process combines machine learning and advanced nano 3D printing techniques to design materials with intricate microstructures, optimizing their properties for various applications. The team’s work aims to improve material performance in fields ranging from aerospace to electronics, highlighting the potential of these newly engineered materials to revolutionize existing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The material is very cool, but I'm almost more interested in the progress in 3D nanofabrication this shows - "printing" material in 3D by selective solidification tends to be pretty slow, as you need to move around like a 3D printer head instead of one-shotting an entire layer like in 2D lithography.The fact that they have made a millimeter scale version of their design instead of a small demo that looks cool under an electron microscope is very impressive! The method is pretty clever too - 2 photon absorption works only where the light is focused (and therefore high intensity). They use a lens array to create 49 focus points, allowing them to parallelize the printing of the repeating grid!Scalable 3D fab could have fun implications for materials like this, and for chip-scale photonics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Nano-architected materials are made of tiny building blocks or repeating units measuring a few hundred nanometres in size — it would take more than 100 of them patterned in a row to reach the thickness of a human hair."I am perpetually shocked that a structure (hair) that we can actually see is so close to nanoscale.(It's also noteworthy that our sense of touch in fact extends into the nanoscale: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02617)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857091</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how complexity physics can identify critical tipping points in chess games, highlighting the intricate dynamics involved in decision-making during play. Researchers have applied concepts from complexity science to analyze chess outcomes, revealing patterns that can predict when a game is likely to change in favor of one player or the other. This study not only enhances the understanding of chess strategies but also illustrates broader implications in the analysis of complex systems in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like an extremely convoluted way of demonstrating a very basic fact, that the authors of the study probably knew beforehand. And that's when a player's position has many weaknesses (or a high 'fragility score') they're probably going to be losing soon. And determining how quickly many pieces can attack a given point versus defend it is, more or less, exactly how you determine if that point is weak. Publish or perish reigns supreme.A lot of science feels like it's becoming much closer to art where you splash a canvas with a few splotches, and then spend an hour describing how it's an insightful representation of the isolation of the modern world and the struggle against depersonalization. At least there you get to then sell it for a few hundred thousand dollars, rather than just live to renew your contract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's really difficult to pick my least favourite part of this article. Could be this;"But the game is about more than algorithms, according to Marc Barthelemy, a physicist at the Paris-Saclay University in France, with layers of depth arising from the psychological complexity conferred by player strategies.Now, Barthelmey has taken things one step further..."At least AI systems can write slop fairly well. Why do I hate this so much? It just feels lazy, underdone, superficial, vaguely nonsensical. The magic of chess has little or nothing todo with the "psychological complexity conferred by player strategies". It has much more to do with aesthetic beauty, and many a great writer has illuminated that. It's utterly unsurprising that you can model the game as nodes interacting in a network graph (I mean essentially that's what it is), and even more unsurprising that the complexity of the interactions is higher in the tense and complicated positions that do indeed often decide the fate of individual games. Note, games not matches. If you can't get even the most basic domain terminology correct, you don't deserve anyone's attention.I'll probably calm down in an hour or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02333&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829677</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction and evolution of SpeedChat, a chat system in Disney's virtual world Toontown. It highlights the motivations behind its creation, focusing on the need for a safer online environment for children. The piece outlines how SpeedChat aimed to simplify communication while ensuring safety by restricting vocabulary, and contrasts it with the previous open chat system. The author also reflects on the impact of this change on the gameplay experience and the community within Toontown.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was so fun to read, and reminded me of Virtual Magic Kingdom (VMK), Disney’s other popular mmo at the time which was basically a Disney-fied Habbo Hotel [1].It ran for about 3 years, but what I found interesting is the chat took the initial approach that the creators here dismissed: a whitelisted vocab list of safe words that you could type, and anything not on it would preclude the message from being sent.There were definitely ways around it, but I also presume active monitoring of the slang, because eventually words like “dam” or phrases “what the shell” were banned too. Another thing that I recall is that case-sensitive spelling mattered, and there was no word bank, so in a way it enforced better spelling.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Magic_Kingdom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The engine [0] that was used for Toontown is still around and is open source. Uses both C++ and Python.[0] https://www.panda3d.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sure enough, chatters figured out a few simple protocols to pass their secret codeI played this game when I was a kid, and "discovered" one of these protocols myself. The only problem was maybe half of the kids wouldn't understand what you were trying to do. But there was a big joy in unlocking unrestricted chat with one of your close friends, who'd you'd previously only been able to chat with via canned messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829050</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is quite something. I suspect this person has a C++ background, because the thing where they're abusing the generic type system to do arithmetic is very much more like C++ template libraries than something you normally see in C#. The advantage seems to be that you can use MakeGenericType() in situations where the normal bytecode Emit() isn't available?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a fan of this particular repository by Jules Jacobs who similarly uses struct based generics (to create immutable collections.)https://github.com/julesjacobs/ImmutableCollections/discussi...It has similar "source generator" hallmarks like in OP's post, for example calling a generic constructor which is JITted to a deeply nested struct type.It's (in my opinion) very hard to reason what the code is doing because it has that flavor of "writing code to generate source to generate code"It's impressive. And i'm pretty sure it's only real hinderance, why it could not be adopted into the base library, is that the repo needs a phd holder to finish implementing the `IList` interface because deleting is really difficult and theoretical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post has a lot of similarities to the 'object algebra' paper by Bruno Oliveira.https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/ecoop2012.pdfIf the OP author has any interest in doing a 1000x service to the C# community, the community needs a translator like you to convert the paper's compiler example into other domain specific examples. I'm pretty sure this paper went nowhere because it lacked a hello world example. something easier to digest and smaller and scope.

&lt;p&gt;The Bitwarden article on new device verification explains the process of ensuring that users can securely access their accounts on new devices. It details the steps for verification, including receiving a verification email or using two-step login (2SV) methods.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to point out that the title is wrong. 2FA is on by default, but not mandatory. Dang, can we change the title?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is terrible, honestly. One of the reasons I use Bitwarden is to be able to not know all my passwords besides the Bitwarden one. I don't know my email password, so can't use that for 2FA. Same for using my phone number or an authenticator app, if I lose my phone, I would also be locked out of my account.The risk of someone stealing my phone is much higher than someone stealing my main password where I live. I intentionally decided not to use 2FA, because that is what makes most sense for my context. I'm ready to take full responsibility for not using 2FA, but now I can't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can understand adding some friction to discourage using Bitwarden without 2FA, but requiring it seems very wrongheaded to make it mandatory. I've been using 2FA on Bitwarden for a while and it adds a lot of friction and made me very nervous that if I lost my phone that I'd be locked out of literally every account I have. I mentioned elsewhere (link below) that I have solved this issue for myself, but people shouldn't be required to jump through these hoops and introduce a greater opportunity to lose access to their accounts if they should lose their phone.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853696&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853696</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses DeepSeek, a tool designed to bypass online censorship by allowing users to access and search for information typically restricted in certain regions. It elaborates on the technical aspects of how DeepSeek operates, including the use of advanced algorithms to locate uncensored content while maintaining user privacy. The author emphasizes the importance of free access to information and the impact of censorship on society, highlighting the ongoing struggle against oppressive regimes that limit freedom of expression. Additionally, the article provides insights into the challenges faced in the development of such tools and the common countermeasures employed by censors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few observations, based on a family member experimenting with DeepSeek.  I'm pretty sure it was running locally.  I'm not sure if it was built from source.The censorship seemed to be based on keywords, applied the input prompt and the output text.  If asked about events in 1990, then asked about events in the previous year DeepSeek would start generating tokens about events in 1989.  Eventually it would hit the word "Tiananmen", at which point it would partially print the word, then in response to a trigger delete all the tokens generated to date and replace them with a message to the effect of "I'm a nice AI and don't talk about such things."If the word Tiananmen was in the prompt, the "I'm a nice AI" message would immediately appear, with no tokens generated.If Tiananmen was misspelled in the prompt, the prompt would be accepted.  DeepSeek would spot the spelling mistake early in its reasoning and start generating tokens until it actually got around to printing to the word Tiananmen, at which point it would delete everything and print the "nice AI" message.I'm no expert on these things, but it looked like the censorship isn't baked into the model but is an external bolt on.  Does this gel with other's observations?  What's the take of someone who knows more and has dived into the source code?Edit: Consensus seems to be that this instance was not being run locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Next up: 1,156 prompts censored by ChatGPTIf published this would, to my knowledge, be the first time anyone has systematically explored which topics ChatGPT censors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's not clear to me is if DeepSeek and other Chinese models are...a) censored at output by a separate processb) explicitly trained to not output "sensitive" contentc) implicitly trained to not output "sensitive" content by the fact that it uses censored content, and/or content that references censoring in training, or selectively chooses training contentI would assume most models are a combination. As others have pointed out, it seems you get different results with local models implying that (a) is a factor for hosted models.The thing is, censoring by hosts is always going to be a thing. OpenAI already do this, because someone lodges a legal complaint, and they decide the easiest thing to do is just censor output, and honestly I don't have a problem with it, especially when the model is open (source/weight) and users can run it themselves.More interesting I think is whether trained censoring is implicit or explicit. I'd bet there's a lot more uncensored training material in some languages than in others. It might be quite hard to not implicitly train a model to censor itself.

But studying what happens to a corpse between death and discovery is quite challenging, and I'm impressed that they devised a suitable experiment and were able to carry it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of lesser known Lem's novel:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Investigation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This type of research is necessary if we want to do forensic pathology. Location affects fauna involved. And also weather and seasons affects how it progresses. One example I read was that different insects are present at different stages. So based on their cycles you can narrow down time of death somewhat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832742</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The compute scheduling part of the paper is also vey good, the way they balanced load to keep compute and communication in check.There is also a lot of thought put into all the tiny bits of optimization to reduce memory usage, using FP8 effectively without significant loss of precision nor dynamic range.None of the techniques by themselves are really mind blowing, but the whole of it is very well done.The DeepSeekV3 paper is really a good read: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSee...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is it that the larger models are better at understanding and following more and more complex instructions. And generally just smarter?With DeepSeek we can now run on non-GPU servers with a lot of RAM. But surely quite a lot of the 671 GB or whatever is knowledge that is usually irrelevant?I guess what I sort of am thinking of is something like a model that comes with its own built in vector db and search as part of every inference cycle or something.But I know that there is something about the larger models that is required for really intelligent responses. Or at least that is what it seems because smaller models are just not as smart.If we could figure out how to change it so that you would rarely need to update the background knowledge during inference and most of that could live on disk, that would make this dramatically more economical.Maybe a model could have retrieval built in, and trained on reducing the number of retrievals the longer the context is. Or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;none of these techniques except MLA are new&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42855170</guid></item><item><title>31.

I had to keep track of the position all the time and there are no constraints.Compared to that I tried Onshape (the free version which is almost the full one but all models are public) and it took me an afternoon to create my pieces. It was really simple, on a generic laptop without any power (a Lenovo P14s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42852048</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of transitive dependencies in software development and their potential benefits, such as reducing redundant code and simplifying dependency management. It explores the challenges posed by these dependencies on security, particularly in terms of vulnerabilities introduced by third-party libraries. The author argues for a balanced approach that retains the advantages of transitive dependencies while implementing strategies to mitigate security risks, including better monitoring and management practices. The piece emphasizes the need for developers to be aware of the trade-offs and to adopt secure coding practices that do not compromise the benefits of using transitive dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anything is going to put capabilities into the programmer ecosystem, I think it's this problem.The neat thing about this particular problem is that you can do some really coarse things and get some immediate benefit. Capabilities in their original form, and perhaps their truest form, carry down the call stack, so that code can do things like "restrict everything that I call can only append to files in this specific subtree" in the most sophisticated implementations. But you could do something more coarse with libraries and just do things like "These libraries can not access the network", and get big wins on some simple assertions. If you're a library for turning jpegs into their pixels, you don't need network access, and with only a bit more work, you shouldn't even need filesystem access (get passed in files if you need them, but no ability to spontaneously create files).This would not be a complete solution, or perhaps even an adequate solution, but it would be a great bang-for-the-buck solution, and a great way to step into that world and immediately get benefits without requiring the entire world to immediately rewrite everything to use granular capabilities everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm bit surprised that browsers did not get a mention here. They are one of the big examples of how an application can be split into gazillion small processes, split along trust boundaries, while also being pretty performance sensitive applications.As for transitive deps, I have some hopes for more "distro" like models to arise. In particular I see clear parallels in how traditional Linux distros work and how large faang style monorepos work. So maybe we could see more these sort of platforms/collections of curated libraries that avoid these deep transitive dep trees by hoisting all the deps into one cohesive global dependency that has at least some more eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Side note, I think the serde yaml debacle was so predictable. As much as I admire Dtolnay his choice to archive the repository and push a deprecated version on cargo made everybody scramble for an alternative "maintained" crate is on him. You can say whatever you want about checkbox security but most people still have to deal with it if only to make the tooling shut up so they can do their work.Maybe the rust fondation should take over more of those fundamental crates when maintainers are not willing or able to continue working on them. A similar problem happened with the zip crate which was transferred rather fast to a new maintainer and most people still use a very old version pre-transfer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857532</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a cheapy Samsung curved 27inch 1080p monitor that use to live in a tax office. It didn't work so it was given to me to see if I could fix it. I noticed I couldn't plug in an HDMI cable without the back of the monitor popping the cable out of it's socket. The only way to get the HDMI cable to plug in all the way was to angle the monitor down at the table. If I try to face it up, the bezel tents out and pushes the cable out of socket.I put the monitor in a corner and left it for around a year. A year later I get another similar monitor with a broken OSD nipple like the one in this article. I noticed that it had no problem with cables being pushed out of socket. I looked at the back of the monitor and saw that there's a little screw just above the inputs on the back of the new monitor.So I snag the screw from the new, broken monitor and try to screw it in to the old 'working' monitor in hopes that it would fix the shell, and it won't screw in. WTF right? Same monitor, same model.. No screw hole but there was a place for a screw, just no hole. 
So I pull the bezel up enough to notice that there actually IS a threaded screw hole behind the shell, there's just no hole in the back for the screw to go in. So I break out a drill, make my own hole and the screw screws right in. Perfectly fixed.First time I ever fixed a monitor with a drill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For something like this, I feel like the work to investigate the guts of the switch mechanism was overkill. I'd rather desolder it wholly, and try to find some component to replace it with. I have little faith in non-break-itude of teeny things when handled slightly incorrectly.That being said, I once replaced the thumbsticks on an X360 controller due to stick drift. It was very fun to destructively open up the old mechanisms and see how they worked.I also operate my sit/stand desk with a pair of tweezers, by shorting some pins on a breakout board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have the same control doodad on my LG monitor. Not only does it apparently fail quite often, it sucks entirely to begin with and is an incredible regression in ergonomics and human interface. So stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828848</guid></item><item><title>34.

I had to use fallen spruce branches to steady myself with each step on the way down. It was like walking on little brooms. It did the job well enough for a southern California native.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you go onto running track that is covered in ice in January, you get to really appreciate those middle distance spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42815697</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of Keycloak for authentication in Angular applications, focusing on the Backend for Frontend (BFF) architectural pattern. It emphasizes how the BFF pattern simplifies communication between the frontend and various backend services by providing a dedicated backend that serves the needs of the frontend. The author outlines the steps to set up Keycloak with Angular, including the configuration of Keycloak, managing authentication tokens, and handling user sessions. Additionally, the article highlights the benefits of using the BFF pattern, such as improved security and streamlined API consumption, making it a valuable reference for developers looking to enhance their Angular applications with robust authentication solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t understand the benefit of adding this intermediate component vs just writing frontend code to interact with the APIs you’d otherwise already be calling. An HTTP server with sessions placed between clients and internal systems makes sense and is standard, but the weird callback-style “remote control” system seems completely unnecessary and inefficient to me. I don’t think client logic being married to some backend vs the client itself makes any real guarantees about functionality being maintained either, it just adds a new location where code needs to be changed when something upstream changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The BFF pattern is just "mostly microservices dedicated to a particular client type".It makes sense when you have drastically different needs between a desktop client and a mobile client (or maybe for a kiosk client or POS interface)Hosting a microservice is cheap, it avoids unnecessary workload on backend data stores, and teams can operate with more autonomy if they don't have to cooperatively update APIs in coordination with other groups with differing priorities.This article really just reads like "I figured out how to do authentication with keycloak using OIDC"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formally proving that you can't be authenticated to a service without actually holding some type of authentication token is trivial.Whatever you replace it with (a short-lived access token, a session cookie, a JWT, or whatever else) becomes the authentication token — if you add other properties (like short expiry), you are mostly trading convenience for security (eg. people will get logged out, or you'll need to implement refresh token dance in your app).So it's really confusing to me how can someone pretend that there is something you can do on the unsafe client side, because you really can't (sure, there are obvious things you shouldn't do, like keep a plain text password in a cookie or localStorage, but an auth token is pretty much the same thing other than expiry).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829315</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this doesn't make things better, but it bears repeating: much as the media would like it to be, this is not caused by AI. Two major things happened in 2022 that everyone knew would cause this if they stuck around:* The Section 174 changes went into effect, requiring all software to be expensed as R&amp;D, which means it can't be deducted from profits directly and instead has to be amortized over 5 years [0].* Interest rates went back up starting in Feb 2022 and continuing through Aug 2023. This chart [1] is a near-perfect mirror of the job trends.I know this doesn't help anyone who's struggling right now, but it does serve to emphasize that this didn't just happen, and it wasn't the result of technological advances making us obsolete. Federal policy was set up to encourage an enormous amount of investment into software development, and it's now... not. Turns out politics matters.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627712[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DfOX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The chart correlates well, with similar references from the US and similar related markets (see [1], [2], [3] and [4] ).At a more macro level, for the United States, I looked at U.S. unemployment data, for the last 80 years. Starting from 1945 until today Jan 2025. All jobs, not only Technology. What jumped out immediately is a clear cyclical pattern: Unemployment peaks occur, on average, every 7–8 years, with some variability.- Shorter Gaps (3–5 years) showed up in the 1950s and early 
 1960s, often tied to small recessions.- Longer Gaps (10–11 years) happened before the early 1990s 
  recession, again around the early 2000s, and more recently 
  between 2009–2010 and 2020.- Outliers include the early 1980s (double-dip recession 
  pushing unemployment above 10%) and, the 2020’s pandemic 
  spike, which briefly soared past 14%.Overall, the business cycle hasn’t radically changed over 80 years: Expansions that push unemployment down to historic lows, followed by recessions that create sharp spikes in unemployment.Assuming 7–8 years is a decent rule of thumb, and based on US history of the last 80 years, we are for a next continued peak into growing unemployment until at least 2027–2028.At a smaller scale, local trends in geopolitics, tariffs, AI adoption, and political dysfunction reflect (or confirm) the broader macro trend.Plan accordingly...And hope I am wrong...[1] Software Development Job Postings on Indeed in the United States: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE[2] Software Development Job Postings on Indeed in Canada:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the future of Svelte 5, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, as presented by its creator Rich Harris. It highlights the framework's improvements, including better performance and enhanced ergonomics, while maintaining simplicity and a focus on developer experience. Harris also emphasizes Svelte's unique compilation approach, its growing community, and the vision for the framework's role in the evolving landscape of web development. The piece aims to inform readers about Svelte 5's advancements and its potential impact on future frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love love love Svelte/Sveltekit. I am an experienced backend engineer and this is the first time I have worked in a FE framework that just clicked.What I like:- Not a whole lot of magic syntax.- The structure of files feels like I am building a backend app, its quite logical and easy to parse through.- Easy to get up and running, I am sure the decisions exist but I struggle historically with all the sidecar products that can be added into the frontend framework.- It combines the beauty of native JS/TS with svelte. I can hydrate a store with my own hand rolled api calls.- There is not a whole lot going on from a API/user perspective. I have stores and routes which are built into the folder structure. I am sure there is more but that gets me to a useful MVP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using Svelte for several years, but haven’t had much time to dive into the many changes in 5.Maybe someone here can shed light on something about runes that feels very off to me. The rune is on the wrong side of the equal sign? Like:  let counter = $state(0);

Looks like a reactive value assigned to a variable, but that’s not at all what’s going on. It’s actually a reactive variable initialized to 0. So, for example, despite what you’d expect you can’t even move the $state call into a utility function if you’d have some reason to. Very counterintuitive to me, and not really touched upon in the docs as far as I’ve seen, but I have to assume there’s some practical reason why they did it this way.I remember Svelte 2 (or 1? Can’t remember) had some weird things like this as well, where you’d think you could do something based on your experience from JavaScript but it just wasn’t supported. The label syntax in Svelte 3 was pretty brilliant because it was a clear indication that you shouldn’t expect normal JS rules to apply. It did have other problems that they appear to have fixed though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved svelte. But svelte5 seems to be a bit of  turn off. It's not even the runes. Slots was hands down the best feature of svelte. And they deprecated it I still can't for the life of me figure out how the new way is supposed to work. The migration docs are very limited. And it's super weird that the parent has to intentionally render children instead of a slots? 
Also, why deprecate the on:event syntax?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857106</guid></item><item><title>43.

Honestly can't say I care about "nearly as good as o1" when its a closed API with no additional info.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought there were three DeepSeek items on the HN front page, but this turned out to be a fourth one, because it's the Qwen team saying they have a secret version of Qwen that's actually better than DeepSeek-V3.I don't remember the last time 20% of the HN front page was about the same thing.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the Cleveland police used artificial intelligence to support a search warrant in a murder case, which ultimately led to complications and the potential derailment of the case. The AI-generated evidence is questioned regarding its reliability and effectiveness, raising concerns about the role of technology in law enforcement and the legal system. Critics argue that reliance on AI in such serious matters may lead to unjust conclusions and legal challenges, highlighting the ethical implications of using technology in criminal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Legg’s affidavit did not disclose that police used facial recognition as part of their identification. He failed to say that Clearview AI issues a disclaimer saying its facial recognition reports are not admissible in court, according to testimony.&gt;He also did not indicate that the facial recognition report returned several photos of people other than Tolbert. The affidavit simply says the fusion center matched Tolbert to “the unidentified male suspect, based on recovered surveillance video.” The filing adds that police also conducted interviews in the case, but it does not say who was contacted or the information provided.AI or not it seems like they got caught lying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that this article seems to be written under the assumption that the AI was entirely correct and Qeyeon Tolbert is the murderer, but the pesky fact that the police used a magic guessing box to identify him is a mere formality that's getting in the way of justice.Innocent until proven guilty eh?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here’s the crux:&gt;At a Jan. 9 hearing, McMonagle agreed with defense attorneys, saying the AI identification of Tolbert was akin to an anonymous informant, which is not enough to establish probable cause.Face matching can be used but it is not admissible evidence in court, and so you can’t use it for a search warrant, you have to find other probable cause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42851124</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores Sweden's cultural shift towards embracing a slower, more relaxed lifestyle, highlighting the concept of "lagom," which means moderation and balance. It delves into various aspects such as the popularity of cozy cafes, nature retreats, and the emphasis on well-being, reflecting a societal desire to de-stress and prioritize mental health. The narrative features different locations and activities in Sweden that promote tranquility and mindfulness, showcasing how the country is redefining leisure and embracing its "sleepy side."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in Sweden and am totally not aware of this trend.However what is not mentioned is that "summer homes" are quite common in Sweden, usually a little cabin somewhere further out from the city that a person or family owns.In my case my girlfriends family shares a house on the coast in Smålland, which even has functioning power and water (rare among these types of vacation homes).I think being able to get away from the noise of the city makes city living significantly more tolerable, I nearly lost my mind when I lived in London for 4 years because anywhere remotely affordable was just loud, and you always felt like you were under someones feet.Taking time away from the noise to get a proper uninterrupted nights rest makes a lot of sense, but I think you also need the reprieve of having personal space. Not that any city in Sweden is even remotely close to the noise levels or population density of a city like London, especially in the parts I could afford to live.This article feels a little bit like lifestyle porn, in that very few people are actually doing this, and it sounds exotic ("just like the scandinavians!") but the reality is actually better than what's depicted and less 1-dimensional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes... spending thousands of $/€ to go somewhere and then focus on sleeping as long as possible instead of  sightseeing, sampling the local cuisine and other stuff regular tourists do, sounds like the ultimate luxury indeed! Because it shows that you have not only the money, but also the free time to travel somewhere just to sleep there - something that a person who can maybe afford the same vacation, but has a limited number of vacation days, won't even consider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool to see this here!I bought a house in Nyland [1] a few years ago and now I'm turning it into a place to retreat to for focus time / being close to nature.If someone is interested in sharing the space over a longer period of time (as I'm not living in Sweden), hit me up (email on my profile)[1] https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ww1GHL5rFXdkcdHfA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828966</guid></item><item><title>46.

This sort of thing has always been popular around here, but I never saw the appeal. The main benefits appear to be usage over SSH, and a certain obscure style due to running in a terminal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll very likely never use this because web and android apps are just too comfortably but I've thoroughly enjoyed seeing the level of detail, quality and options available there.One question (and apologies if it was on the documentation), but is it possible to automate to download and archive series for later watching without internet? This is my number #1 usage scenario, mostly getting the fresh chapters and have them locally because they disappear from the URL after some time or I might want to just watch while travelling without internet somewhere.Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just skimming the README, is there actually something inherently special about anime? Or is there some quasi-standard format how you acquire them these days (maybe something with subtitles?) - I think the last anime I played on a computer was still DivX ;)I see mpv, so it's basically a file browser for movie files?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828459</guid></item><item><title>48.

People really dont appreciate the magnitude of the disruptive force that is unleashed by the open source paradigm. In a year from now the landscape will be brimming with new initiatives. In a few years nobody will even remember "open"ai.Conventional economic theory will always misread the future of computing (and thus "AI"). The zero marginal cost and infinite replicability is not a bug, its a feature. But so far we dont really have a good model how to think about it and merge it with mainstream business models. Something must pay the bills eventually but these are very different bills from those of conventional scarcity based businesses. Ironically in the end the main scarcity is human ingenuity. Read the interview of the Deepseek founder on why their models are open source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeepSeek has demonstrated that there is no technical moat. Model training costs are plummeting, and the margins for APIs will just get slimmer. Plus model capabilities are plateauing. Once model improvement slows down enough, seems to me like the battle is to be fought in the application layer. Whoever can make the killer app will capture the market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just playing devil's advocate:VCs (esp those who missed out on OAI) are heavily incentivized to root for OAI to fail, and commoditize the biggest COGs item (AI models).This guy is just talking his book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42847825</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow-up question: what work has been done on client-side moderation? I know this gets dangerously close to the kind of content scanning that eg apple has tried (to very detrimental results), but hear me out: I really think this is a prerequisite to end-to-end encryption on a social network (there has to be some level of protection; even if 100% of users report 100% of bad content, imagine scrolling a feed and stumbling upon CSAM simply because you were the first person to see it). I also also think it's possible to strike a balance that preserves user agency while still protecting them, by simply inserting a manual reporting step. So, for example, potentially problematic content gets put behind an interstitial with a content warning and options to view, hide, report, etc. But again, this requires client-side content classification.I'm aware of eg NSFWJS, which is a tensorflowJS model [1]. Is there anything else that, say, can also do violence/gore detection?[1] https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is a static site hosting platform required to proactively monitor which content paying users host in your jurisdiction?Wouldn't a solid set of processes to handle content complaints and knowing who your customers are in case the hosting country's law enforcement has a case suffice?Or are you having some free tier where users can anonymously upload stuff?In the latter case — a free place to stash megabytes — you'll need to detect password protected archives in addition to unencrypted content. Get ready for a perpetual game of whack-a-mole though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you care about moderation, a lot of it has to be done manually. Manual moderation requires placing a high level of trust in the moderators. That means that either you pay them well enough to care, or you build a community which user-moderators will protect.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Sublime Text. It's one of my favorite pieces of software. I have it running 100% of the time on every machine I work on.It's where I write all of my personal notes, blog posts, and it's where I wrote both "Game Programming Patterns" and "Crafting Interpreters".At the same time, it's not the tool I use as an IDE. For programming, I use whatever IDE is dominant for the language I'm working in. Over time, that's been Visual C++, Visual Studio, XCode, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and most recently VS Code.That doesn't mean to me that I want Sublime to turn into an IDE. I like that it's lighterweight than that. It's the perfect sweet spot for me of rich enough to handle piles of notes and documents and small scale code editing, but not so huge and cumbersome that it gets in my way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sublime Text developer here, thank you for all the praise! I'm looking forward to what we can accomplish this year. If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So glad to see this. I have been down a long road of text editors:- Sublime
- Vim
- Emacs
- Atom
- VSCode
- Jetbrains IDE
- Neovim
- Zed
- CursorAnd these aren’t just little flings. I’ve spent months if not years in most of these editors. However, at the end of the day I always come back to one: Sublime.It is a beautiful piece of software. It feels like writing with one’s “good pen and good paper”, that high quality stationary sort of thing. It is just me and the code. There is something that just feels different or even tactile about Sublime. That actually leads me to ask as this is outside of my expertise: why does Sublime feel more tactile/real than other editors? When I look at the code in other editors it feels like I’m looking at a projector on a wall. When I look at the code in Sublime it feels like I’m looking at something painted on the wall. Anybody else have the same experience? What’s the psychological/software reason for that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42862246</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But now with reasoning systems and verifiers, we can create brand new legitimate data to train on. This can either be done offline where the developer pays to create the data or at inference time where the end user pays!&gt; This is a fascinating shift in economics and suggests there could be a runaway power concentrating moment for AI system developers who have the largest number of paying customers. Those customers are footing the bill to create new high quality data … which improves the model … which becomes better and more preferred by users … you get the idea.While I think this is an interesting hypothesis, I'm skeptical. You might be lowering the cost of your training corpus by a few million dollars, but I highly doubt you are getting novel, high quality data.We are currently in a world where SOTA base model seems to be capped at around GPT4o levels. I have no doubt that in 2-3 years our base models will compete with o1 or even o3... just it remains to be seen what innovations/optimizations get us there.The most promising idea is to use reasoning models to generate data, and then train our non-reasoning models with the reasoning-embedded data. But... it remains to be seen how much of the chain of thought reasoning you can really capture into model weights. I'm guessing some, but I wonder if there is a cap to multi-head attention architecture. If reasoning can be transferred from reasoning models to base models, OpenAI should have already trained a new model with o3 training data, right?Another thought is maybe we don't need to improve our base models much. It's sufficient to have them be generalists, and to improve reasoning models (lowering price, improving quality) going forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The o3 system demonstrates the first practical, general implementation of a computer adapting to novel unseen problems"Yet, they said when it was announced:"OpenAI shared they trained the o3 we tested on 75% of the Public Training set. They have not shared more details. We have not yet tested the ARC-untrained model to understand how much of the performance is due to ARC-AGI data."These two statements are completely opposed. I can't take seriously anything this article says about o3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The claim is that this removes the human bottleneck (aka SFT or supervised fine tuning) on domains with a verifiable reward. Critically, this verifiable reward is extremely hard to pin down in nearly all domains besides mathematics and computer science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868390</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The content of the YouTube short features a brief, engaging video that likely showcases a humorous or entertaining moment, given the platform's focus on short-form content. The video could involve a creative or relatable scenario, designed to capture viewers' attention quickly and keep them entertained within a limited timeframe. The aim is to encourage shares and likes through its light-hearted or amusing narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

I've written a bout my experience on my blog: https://tunn3l.pro. although not bedridden, my life got totally flipped upside down. I just want to live a normal live again. To all ME/CFS and LC sufferers: Don't give up!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My sister had ME/CFS after she had a burnout after her second kid. She was never permanently bed ridden but sometimes had to spend days resting or recovering after strain. She's not well today, but much better than at her worst. There wasn't really an accepted diagnose for it when my sister got it, and she had to fight to be recognised as sick.I do wish Dianna the best recovery and future progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my dearest friends suffers from ME/CFS - she's been bed ridden for 3 years now. Any stimulation is just so painful her.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses allegations that DeepSeek, a data collection service, may have unlawfully obtained vast amounts of data that OpenAI previously utilized for training its models. It explores the implications of these claims, including potential legal ramifications and the ethical considerations surrounding data sourcing for AI development. The piece raises concerns about transparency and accountability in the AI industry and emphasizes the need for clearer regulations regarding data ownership and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explains OAuth 2.0, a widely-used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to user accounts without sharing passwords. It outlines how OAuth 2.0 works, emphasizing the roles of the resource owner, client application, authorization server, and resource server. The piece details the different grant types—such as authorization code, implicit, password, and client credentials—each catering to different application needs. It also highlights the importance of OAuth 2.0 in enhancing security and user experience by allowing users to grant permissions selectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love reading blog posts on oauth2 and oidc. I have a mental model on how it works but every person has their own way to describe the flows. So far my favorite article has been oauth-oidc from first principles[1] and why each piece of the protocol is useful.This being hackernews, any comment worthwhile cannot be devoid of criticism. Trust-on-first-use is used incorrectly here -- saving the previous authorization scopes is just caching. TOFU has a specific definition in security: it's when you're establishing a secure channel but you haven't shared a secret or public key a-priori -- it makes it impossible to guarantee that the counter-party is whom they say they are. Very concretely TOFU is a diffie hellman key exchange with a shared secret that can be MitMed. Through use in time the shared secret gains integrity because the probability of a persistent MitM accross channels degrades. The most common place TOFU is encountered is when connecting via ssh to a server and the server accepts your connection because you're in their authorized_keys but the server's key is not in your known_hosts.[1] https://stack-auth.com/blog/oauth-from-first-principles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an Oauth2 hater, I consider this protocol cursed, mainly due to how hard it is to read through all the specs and have a useful understanding of what one should do with it. Reading the OIDC spec, where they define authN in terms of authZ, lets me experience what a stroke must feel like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a non-web person, I find everything related to this auth business needlessly complicated and arbitrarily limited. Most of the time it's not even implemented correctly anyway (many application not checking the JWT audience...) because web devs just use libraries without understand what actually provides the security.As an application writer, I want the user to feed me a token signed by a trusted entity that proves he is who he claims he is and has the necessary accesses enabled for my application.Whether this happens transparently via a redirect to the trusted entity login webpage and back to my app or whether I request the user to go to a specific url on their own while I wait for them to do so is just an UX detail. Why every approach needs to be labeled a "flow", authorized separately, and come with their own limitations is beyond me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829149</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of composable SQL, highlighting its advantages in building flexible and maintainable data processing systems. It emphasizes how composable SQL allows developers to combine different SQL queries modularly, enabling easier adjustments and integrations over traditional monolithic SQL structures. The piece also explores practical applications, its compatibility with existing SQL databases, and the potential for enhancing data workflows and analytics. Overall, the article advocates for adopting composable SQL as a modern approach to handling complex data operations effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828883"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article:&gt; What you hope happens is that Postgres will recursively inline every view, merge them all together into a gigaquery, and shuffle the predicates up and down to maximally optimize the query. That was the conceit. And of course that never happens.The author seems to be describing a Progress-specific problem. Oracle, SQL Server (and probably other "enterprise" databases as well) are pretty good at inlining views and then optimizing the whole resulting gigaquery as if the views were not there in the first place.&gt; The central problem is that views have to be written for the general case, and then you filter on the view’s output. Views can’t take parameters.SQL Server supports inline table-valued functions, which are exactly that - parametrized and inlinable views.Unfortunately, they are not as composable as they could be. For example, a function returning table and a function accepting the same type of a table as input cannot be directly composed - you'd first need to store the first function's result in a temporary table or table variable. But despite the limitations, functions are extremely useful for constructing complex queries which reuse logic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how CTEs are efficiency minefields and how Postgres doesn't do a good job of pushing down predicates, for example.TBH, the solution is to improve the Postgres engine in this regard?For example, in Bigquery I often use CTEs and see predictable speedups that are explained by predicate pushdown when slapping a WHERE clause on the user of a CTE etc.  Bigquery has plenty of performance gotchas but I don't think CTEs are one of them; they seem to be transparent to the optimiser.Something else that Bigquery supports is user-defined 'table' functions.  These are like the 'functors' the article creates.However, in practice they aren't very widely used, and I think this hints that they aren't as useful as the article is hoping for.The thing I _really_ want is scoping.  If only functions could be described like CTE WITH blocks, e.g.   WITH visits AS (
      SELECT ...
      FROM web_logs
      WHERE ...
   ),
   foo(bar INT, baz STRING) AS (
      ... function body here
   )
   SELECT ..., foo(a, b), ...
   FROM visits
   WHERE ...

Apart from the tidiness of this, this allows inlining of functions into the SQL statement body rather than as separate statements.  Often various tooling e.g. DBT makes it really hard to with separate function definitions etc, and being able to inline logic would make things possible.Bigquery also supports user-defined aggregate functions.  Although there is rarely the need to stray from the standard builtin aggregate functions, when you need them they are brilliant.(Anyone working _on_ Bigquery reading?  If so, please ping me, I have loads of feedback on what works well and where the user pain and toil is ;) )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on a project that does tons of SQL based data transformations (thousands). A lot of it isn't backed by unit tests. Some of our people with more of a C++ background have got the idea that this is crazy, every bit of business logic should be encapsulated into a function just like in every other civilized language, so that it could be unit tested. They built a framework like this for SQL and implemented quite a few jobs with it.The problem is most of the SQL-first devs hate it and would rather write untested code, or rely on alternative test automation techniques like bringing up a local DB instance with fake data, than have to refit their business logic into pure functions. The truth is that it's just not a way of working that comes naturally to people who write a lot of SQL for a living.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828883</guid></item><item><title>7.

It’s hard to say why it worked — my friends assume that the microbiome is implicated because of the dietary change. Plausible, but hardly a proof. This gives me at least one direction to look in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a "you don't know what you don't know" thing. This article lays out a path way for a link between a chemical that is common in our lives and depression. That pathway is a common gut bacteria. The article ends with this:"So taken together, there would seem to be good reason to continue to unravel the long-hypothesized inflammation/depression connection, and particularly in regards to possible exacerbating factors such as higher levels of M. morganii infection or even higher environmental exposure to diethanolamine. We seem to have a lot to learn here!"diethanolamine is commonly used in liquid laundry and dish washing detergents, cosmetics, shampoos and hair conditioners. So you really don't know if your hair conditioner, shampoo or dish washing detergent is causing you inflammation &amp; depression. Hmmm.We, as in the institutions that supposedly protect consumers, work on the assumption that anything can be used and added until it is proven not safe. For example, thalidomide. We did not know it would cause deformed babies, so it was assumed to be safe.Okay, so will some corporation knowingly use something that is hazardous, just to make more money. Well we have the Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma. Or you can go watch "Erin Brokovitch".

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat, I love projects like these.The next level down is to do it directly in numpy.And then from there, write a minimal numpy work-a-like to support the model above.You start with a working system using the most powerful abstractions. Then you iteratively remove abstractions, lowering your solution, then when you get low enough but still riding on an external abstraction, you rewrite that, but ONLY to support the layers above you.Following the above pattern, you can bootstrap yourself to have full system understanding. This is not unlike RL+distillation that human persons do learn complex topics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;github has a bunch of them for years, the most known from Andrej Karpathy:https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPTsome other have MoE implemented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a google collab notebook built from this.

They are so automated that they also create staff members and fake profiles on LinkedIn, specifically for that spam effort. Nobody at LinkedIn gives a shit about those fake avatars, I reported hundreds by now and they did absolutely nothing.Anyways, long story short, here's the blocklist of those ASNs and companies. I'm working on the map at the moment and don't wanna publish it until I can prove its correctness:[1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in the US Navy, I learned most of the time, the weak points in security were usually people. Attackers know this and exploit it. And it usually wasn't movie plot style "do this or your wife gets it" exploits. Those seemed to get blown up easily. It was mundane things. Distracting a watch stander with something that was actually stupid. Making someone late for duty. Putting something really gross in the garbage hoping the inspector would skip that bag. So many little lapses in human judgement. Most completely innocent. This was with vigilant, uniformed people subject to military discipline, and those thing happened.So you have to focus on process and systems. Some easy stuff:* Never ask customers/employees for a password. If someone does it's a scam.* Refund money only to the payment method used to pay for the product/service.* 2FA is your friend no matter how much the VP of Sales whines about it.* have a way to expire tokens and force reset of passwords.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  People connecting through our VPN have access to an internal-only SMTP gateway machine that doesn't require SMTP authentication.Time to clean that up while you're at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42862873</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The Sentry risk assessment system provides detailed information about the potential risks of near-Earth objects (NEOs), specifically focusing on object 2024 YR4. The page outlines the object's characteristics, its trajectory, the likelihood of impact with Earth, and any observational data available. It assesses potential impact scenarios and highlights ongoing monitoring efforts by NASA to track NEOs that may pose a threat to our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on the Near Earth Object Surveyor space telescope (NEO Surveyor) writing simulation code which predicts which objects we will see. 
This one has drummed up a bit of interest due to its (relatively) high chance of impact. I actually spent quite a bit of time yesterday digging through archive images trying trying to see if it was spotted on some previous times it came by the Earth (no luck unfortunately). Since we saw it so briefly, our knowledge of its orbit is not that great, and running the clock back to 2016 for example ended up with a large chunk of sky where it could have been, and it is quite small. We will almost certainly see it again with NEO Surveyor years before its 2032 close encounter. I have not run a simulation for it, but I would not be surprised if LSST (a large ground telescope survey which is currently coming online) to catch it around the same time NEO Surveyor does.Our knowledge of the diameter of this object is a bit fuzzy, because of surface reflectivity, small shiny things can appear as bright as dark large things. This is one of the motivations of making the NEO Surveyor an IR telescope, since IR we see black body emission off of the objects, which is mostly size dependent, and only weakly albedo dependent.There is an even tinier chance that if it misses the Earth in 2032, it could hit the moon. I haven't run the numbers precisely for that one, but it impacted a few times in some monte-carlo simulations.If anyone is interested in orbit dynamics, I have open sourced some of the engine we are using for observation predictions: https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/keteIt is relatively high precision, though JPL Horizons has more accurate gravitational models and is far better suited for impact studies. My code is primarily for predicting when objects will be seen in telescopes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not an increase over baseline risk (as its Palermo scale[0] indicates, being a negative number, -0.56).I think there's going to be a crisis of media going forwards, because with the very awesome new telescope[1] that's going online this year, the number of these detections is going to drastically go up. The number of objects isn't going up—they've always been there, we just didn't know—but I think the media coverage is not going to absorb that nuance very well.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo_Technical_Impact_Hazar... ("A rating of 0 means the hazard is equivalent to the background hazard (defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact)")[1] https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/01/1108643/vera-c-r... ("With its capacity to detect faint objects, [Vera] Rubin is expected to increase the number of known asteroids and comets by a factor of 10 to 100")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working link: https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=2024%20Y...8.1 megatons of kinetic energy. According to the Torino rating, only risk of “localized destruction” (less than “regional devastation”): https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/torino_scale.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864272</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The website showcases a coding course created by Jimmy H. Miller, focusing on teaching the fundamentals of programming through interactive projects and hands-on exercises. It emphasizes the importance of discovery-based learning, encouraging students to explore coding concepts while creating their own projects. The course aims to build a strong foundation in coding skills, suitable for beginners and those looking to enhance their knowledge in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860128"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone said on HN a while back that this sort of approach is the most sensible, because any design doc is just an incomplete abstraction until you get in the weeds to see where all the tricky parts are. Programming is literally writing plans for a computer to do a thing, so writing a document about everything you need to write the plan is an exercise in frustration. And if you DO spend a lot of time making a perfect document, you've put in far more work than simply hacking around a bit to explore the problem space. Because only by fully exploring a problem can you confidently estimate how long it will take to write the real code. Often times after the first draft I just need to clean things up a bit or only half complete a bad solution before improving it. Yes, there are times you need to sit and have a think first, but less often than you might imagine.Of course, at a certain scale and team size a tedious document IS the fastest way to do things... but god help you if you work on a shared code base like that.I've always thought the rigid TDD approach and similar anti-coding styles really lend themselves to people that would rather not be programming. Or at least have a touch of the OCD and can't stand to not have a unit test for every line of code. Because it really is a lot more work both up front and in maintenance to live that way.Cyber-paper is cheap, so don't be afraid to write some extra lines on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's a dangerous philosophy for professional work. You know what happens to code that works? It ships.If you code out a solution to the problem in order to discover the problem space, I think the idea here is that you then can go back and write a better solution that accounts for all of the stuff you discovered via refactoring and whatnot. But you're not going to do that refactoring. You're going to ship it. Because it works and you don't know of any problems with it. Are there scaling problems? Probably, you haven't run into any yet. Does your solution fit whatever requirements other interested parties might have? Who knows! We didn't do any designing or thinking about the problem yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am an avid discovery coder and was actually day dreaming an outline for a similar article on my way home on the bus today. I think this is an extremely important concept at all levels of engineering and something we all need to adopt at one point or another in our careers / practice.I think it follows a few topics, "the art of the POC/Spike" or just exploratory coding. These things give us a tangible hands on approach for understanding the codebase, and I think lend to better empathy and understanding of a software system and less rash criticisms of projects that may be unfamiliar.This is particularly relevant to me right now as I am discovery coding a fairly large project at my company and working with product to lay out design and project planning. Whats difficult to express from my current standing is how the early stages of these types of projects are more milestone / broad based rather than isolated small key pieces. Sure I can spend a week delivering design, architecture, epic, outline docs for all the known and unknown features of the project (and I am). But at the same time I need to discover and test out base case / happy path solutions to the core business problem to more accurately understand the scope of the project.I think its something I particularly love about being a TL / IC at my company. I have the flexibility and trust to "figure it out" and the working arrangement to provide adequate professional documentation at the appropriate time. I am fortunate to have that buy in from leadership and certainly recognize it as a unique situation.All that being said:1. Learn how to effectively isolate and run arbitrary parts of your system for YOUR understanding and learning
2. Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
3. Learn to summarize and document your findings in a suitable fashion for your situation
4. Encourage this throughout your team. Useful in all aspects from bug triage to greenfield work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860128</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a coincidence, Australian astronomers published a paper on a new interferometry-based system for fast radio burst detection today too:https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/News/2025/January/Australia...https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; emanating from somewhere in the northern constellation Ursa Minor.I've heard about some great publishing corporations out of Ursa Minor. Guide research?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CHIME is great because it is so cheap. It's parabolic cylinders lying on the ground pointing fixedly straight up. The construction and mantainence cost per meter^2 of effective aperture is the lowest it possibly can be. It's basically a handful of large "half pipe" looking things next to shipping containers packed full of GPUs and power equipment. The only downside to this parabolic cylinder design is reflections down the long axis of the cylinder but that can be mitigated.It's a (nearly) filled aperture with lots of redundant baselines which allows for easier calibration and seeing through the galactic foreground. But being so (relatively) closely spaced it's resolution is limited. Adding outriggers fixes this for when they want to get a position and I'd bet they put one at angles to the main array cylinder direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42854887</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of creating a smartwatch designed specifically for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). It outlines the motivation behind the project, which includes the desire for better management of diabetes through technology. The author details the technical aspects involved in building the smartwatch, such as selecting components, programming, and integrating features that track glucose levels, insulin delivery, and notifications. Additionally, the post highlights challenges faced during development and the importance of user feedback in refining the device. Overall, it serves as an informative guide for those interested in diabetes tech innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow! This is some phenomenal engineering!&gt; Another area that stumped me is how to shut the power off 100% on the device, so that it can remain “off” for weeks or months.This is actually a pretty solvable problem...https://circuitcellar.com/resources/quickbits/soft-latching-...Then the microcontroller can choose at any time to completely shut off the entire circuit (including itself), and extremely little power will be consumed until something (like a button) completes the power-on circuit again.For ease of prototyping, there are off-the-shelf units you can play with: https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-soft-power-switch-jst-2mm....Some more advanced soft power switch circuits (like the SparkFun switch) also include the ability to forcibly power down a misbehaving device by holding down the button.The design used in the SparkFun switch also allows your microcontroller to know if the button is pushed while the device is running, so you could imagine repurposing your existing button to also restore power to the device if the device is off, and still retain the existing functionality for cycling through watch faces. Then, either the device could automatically shut itself off after a period of inactivity or when the battery gets too low, or the user could click and hold the button for some number of seconds to turn the device off completely that way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First of all -- awesome!Second, if you aren't aware or in case others are interested, the main dev from the xdrip project released a custom watch as well: https://bluejay.website/
There are some posts on reddit from the dev. (for others -- the watch is available for purchase, and allows integration w/ xdrip).Third --&gt; we've come a long way in a short time. When I was diagnosed I had to collect urine samples and drop chemical tablets in them to see how much glucose was present. And now you are building an custom solution tailored to your and your son's needs...wow. I really applaud you.Fourth --&gt; I'm hoping the new discoveries in the synthetic signaling w/ insulin will finally give us a biological solution and the tech will no longer be necessary. Here's to hoping!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of skills one has to master for a project like this is just mind-boggling, and the part about the tortilla press made me laugh out loud. A labor of love in the most literal sense!That said, I would feel pretty nervous about actually selling these, as I wouldn't be surprised if it is legally a medical device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42854291</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how ByteDance implemented eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to improve networking performance in their infrastructure. By leveraging eBPF, ByteDance was able to achieve better visibility into network traffic, enhance troubleshooting capabilities, and optimize performance metrics. The case study highlights the significant improvements in efficiency and reliability obtained through eBPF, showcasing its potential benefits for enterprises looking to enhance their network operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Netkit, which is what this is built on, is pretty neat. For transmitting packets from one container/VM to another, the conventional solution is to give each its own veth device. When you do that, the kernel network stack, at like the broad logic level, is sort of oblivious to the fact that the devices aren't real ethernet devices and don't have to go through the ethernet motions to transact.Netkit replaces that logic with a simple pairing of sending and receiving eBPF programs; it's an eBPF cut-through for packet-level networking between networks that share a host kernel. It's faster, and it's simpler to reason about; the netkit.c code is pretty easy to read straight through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see a more complete picture of ByteDance's TikTok infra. They released "KubeAdmiral" (1) so I'm assuming they're using eBPF via a Kubernetes CNI, and I see ByteDance listed on Cilium's github (2). They're also using KubeRay (3) to orchestrate huge inference tasks. It's annoying that a company I definitely do not want to work for has such an incredibly interesting infrastructure!1. https://github.com/kubewharf/kubeadmiral2. https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/USERS.md3. https://www.anyscale.com/blog/how-bytedance-scales-offline-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; eBPF is a technology that can run programs in a privileged context such as the operating system kernel. It is the successor to the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF, with the "e" originally meaning "extended") filtering mechanism in Linux and is also used in non-networking parts of the Linux kernel as well.&gt; It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel at runtime without requiring changes to kernel source code or loading kernel modules. Safety is provided through an in-kernel verifier which performs static code analysis and rejects programs which crash, hang or otherwise interfere with the kernel negatively.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF?useskin=vector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42866572</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a situation in Germany where customers of Seagate reported receiving hard drives that appeared to be used and resold, rather than new. These drives, sold as new products, reportedly showed signs of extensive prior use, with some having clocked tens of thousands of hours. This has raised concerns regarding consumer trust and the integrity of the product selling process, prompting an investigation into Seagate's practices and customer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can read out the FARM logs of Seagate hard drives using    smartctl -l farm /dev/sd&lt;n&gt;

They're supposed to be "more trustworthy" than the regular SMART stats.(My two "new" 16TB Exos drives had 0 hours (regular) and ~18k hours (farm) - DOM 04JUN2021 and 07JUN2021. Also, zfs refused to format the drive: 'already formatted as ddf_raid_member'.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had enough problems with new Seagate Exos drives (actually new, not remanufactured or whatever these folks ended up with,) that I've taken to buying used Western Digital Ultrastar drives on Amazon for my NAS.  They're cheaper, and so far, reliable enough.  I wrote a little more about my rationale[0], but, basically:1. With RAID-6, I can take two drive failures, and it is quicker to get a replacement off Amazon than wait for an OEM to RMA a drive under warranty2. The Ultrastars have been pretty reliable in Backblaze's published data3. The reseller I went through seems reliable enough4. There's at least some evidence these "remanufactured" drives are coming from the OEMs, and based on past experience working at a few hardware manufacturers, the no trouble found rate for RMA'd hardware is typically quite high - to the point there is likely to be nothing wrong with a product that has been returned under warranty.I guess a side benefit of this is at least I know I'm buying used drives.0 - https://marcusb.org/posts/2024/03/used-hard-drives-from-tech...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those Exos drives have been popular with homelab types because they are usually $50-$100 cheaper than prosumer drives that claim to save maybe 0.5 W and 2-3 db of noise on the datasheet.  (The latter could be effaced by a bad bearing anywhere in your build,  I haven't seen either claim tested by a review site)It's funny but in this case the enterprise product is the cheap mainstream product and the 10-20 SKUs aimed at prosumers are the exotic expensive products.  It is senseless to me that vendors like WD make special SKUs for security camera use or for 2-3 bay NAS,  4-7 bay NAS, etc when all it means is Best Buy won't stock any of them, development costs are spread out over fewer units, more versions of firmware and hardware to have bugs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864788</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those unaware, this was probably posted today because the origin of Lyme disease came up in RFK, Jr.'s Senate confirmation hearings today. He was asked if he had indeed claimed that "Lyme disease is a highly likely militarily engineered bioweapon" and he responded that he "probably did say that".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Old Lyme resident here, high school class of 82 - it was the younger siblings of my classmates who were getting "Lyme arthritis" starting in the late 70s or maybe 1980.Like most of the populated Northeast, most the area was cleared farmland or grazing land until WWI or maybe WWII - all those stone walls in the middle of the woods used to be borders between open fields. I don't think there was an ecosystem that could support Lyme disease near where people lived until maybe the 70s - the cycle needs both deer and mice, in proximity to humans to get infected, and you're not going to get either of them on open land that's grazed or under cultivation.So Lyme disease could have been around long before that, farther into the woods, and probably wouldn't have been noticed by people who had good enough doctors to figure out what was going on, or were healthy (rich?) enough for the symptoms of Lyme disease to be considered something out of the ordinary.The fact that Lyme disease exists in Europe already seemed to indicate that it's been around a very long time, but this finding adds more evidence. For that matter, I wonder if it's yet another disease that was introduced to the Americas by Europeans?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating!Living in Europe nearby, I've visited the museum multiple times in the past decade. It's one of my favorite standbys to take relatives or friends to. Can't recommend it—and Bolzano, or Bozen, depending on whether you lean Italian or German—enough!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868464</guid></item><item><title>19.

I know others are questioning the "no downtime" bit, but that is why service level objectives exist -- because it really depends on the customer experience.If you managed to have a cutover with no noticeable dip in business metrics (aka the users didn't notice) then I'd call that a no-downtime upgrade!Very clever on the improvement over Lyft's methods.  Thanks for the writeup.  Now maybe someone can get it down from 3 seconds of pausing. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pause all writes &gt; let 16 to catch up &gt; resume writes on 16Isn’t that….. downtime? Unless you mean downtime to be only when reads are also not available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zero-downtime Postgres upgrades have been kind of normalized, at least in the environments I have been exposed to, with pgcat  https://github.com/postgresml/pgcat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867657</guid></item><item><title>20.

Meaning that your SACD rips in DSD format are not transcoded. Plex cannot do that, neither can any subsonic server or jellyfin.You need a native player for this, but it is doable. Mpv at least can play the files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very nice, however it doesn't seem to support subsonic yet, which means no Android Auto integration through Ultrasonic.I'm going to keep watch on this, there aren't many music players with interfaces that look that nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How's the support for the Album Artist tag? This is a common paint point I have with every single self-hosted solution, shockingly I've found Jellyfin to handle it the best so far.Use case: Japanese doujin (basically label compilation) albums.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42850109</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the sad realities about physical libraries is that they are dying, at least in American university systems that have been parasitized by management consulting firms.For instance, Georgia Tech recently moved their physical collection to off-campus stacks shared with Emory University, and both the University of South Carolina and Texas A&amp;M University systems are downsizing collections and moving towards an access model reliant on the ILL system. The A&amp;M system has even gone further and largely eliminated tenure for librarians. Other university systems, like the one in my snall state, have started to push checking out ebooks over physical books in various ways, possibly in preparation for more drastic changes like this, or at least so that they can begin downsizing their collectionsThis doesn't just affect students at universities, since many public institutions have historically offered community borrowing, and often have extremely rare books that simply aren't available otherwiseIt's a complicated issue since this phenomenon is driven partly by user demand -- students are reading much less than they used to, and far less in the way of physical books, and university systems are responding to changes in demand. It's still sad to see&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Libraries will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no libraries.&gt;---Anne Herbert, _The Next Whole Earth Catalog_ (1980), p 331.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know someone who works at a public library in a small city. A lot of their work is "managing" homeless, mentally ill, and drug addicted customers who are attracted by shelter and free computers and internet.I don't particularly have a problem with public funds going toward that, but I don't think library staff are trained or signed up for that work, or that libraries are an appropriate and cost effective way to help these people.I don't think libraries should be sacred. They're nice to look at and nostalgic, but are increasingly anachronisms. Specialized facilities for higher education and historical research I can see still having some use, perhaps small school libraries, but the average public library not so much. They use a lot of space, a lot of floor space for books, requires staffing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860240</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significant impact of adding iodine to table salt in the 1920s on improving the IQ levels of Americans. It highlights how iodine deficiency was a widespread issue that affected cognitive development, particularly in children. With the introduction of iodized salt, the prevalence of goiters and related health problems diminished, resulting in enhanced overall brain function and higher intelligence quotients in the population. The piece emphasizes the importance of public health interventions in addressing nutrient deficiencies and their long-term effects on societal health and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to efficiently parse PDFs in Elixir by leveraging Rust for performance improvements. It explains the limitations of existing Elixir libraries for PDF parsing and presents a solution that involves writing a Rust-based library that can be called from Elixir, ensuring faster processing and better resource management. The author provides a step-by-step guide on setting up the Rust library, integrating it with Elixir, and demonstrates the overall performance benefits of this approach, making it a useful resource for developers looking to enhance PDF handling in their Elixir applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been thinking a lot about how to accomplish various RAG things in Elixir (for LLM applications). PDF is one of the missing pieces, so glad to see work here. The really tricky part is not just parsing out the text (you can just call the pdftotext unix command line utility for that), but accurately pulling out things like complex tables, etc in a way that could be chunked/post processed in a useful way. I'd love to see something like Unstructured or Marker but in Rust (i.e., fast) that Elixir could NIF out to it. And maybe some kind of hybrid system that uses open llm models with vision capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Shoe Factory Principle is a concept that highlights the importance of tailored design and development processes in collaboration with end-users to ensure functionality and purpose. It critiques approaches that prioritize theoretical models over practical needs, emphasizing the value of iterative feedback and real-world applications in creating effective solutions. This principle serves as a reminder for developers and designers to engage directly with those who will use their products, ensuring that the final outcome meets actual requirements rather than abstract ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Not to me confused with the Soviet shoe factories that produced only one type and orientation of shoe - with the other half of the pair being shipped in from 500 miles away.This reminded me of something our anti-counterfeiting startup learned when integrating into manufacturing for a high-end outdoor apparel brand.There are efficiencies that the factory gets by, say, parallelizing work on the sleeves of a jacket, while other parts are also worked on.  But each batch of dyed outer material may have slight variation in color, no matter how hard they calibrate.So, their processes are designed to ensure that, when the jacket pieces come together, they all came from the same dyed batch of outer material.(There were many interesting tidbits like that, and those were just the ones relevant to us, in terms we could understand.  I'm sure the factory also knew a million other things.)Probably the Soviet shoes of TFA had worse problems than slightly mismatched color.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A similar thing I've noticed in the last ~6 years is in regards to smartphones, and in particular their cameras.Android is pretty standardized these days, and even a fairly cheap Android phone will probably do most smartphone things (make calls, send texts, watch YouTube, etc.) reasonably well, but a corner that seems to be cut in cheaper phones is almost always the camera, and that kind of makes sense.If you're buying your phone online, you can look at the more-or-less objective specs of the phone like how much RAM it has, or how fast the CPU is, but you can't really tell how the photos will look [1], and as such it's easy to put a cheaper sensor or lens in there, especially in the cheaper phones which (I think) have lower margins.[1] Even if the listing has sample pictures, you don't know how representative they are of the actual experience; they could just have taken the sample photos with ideal lighting, with a tripod, in a controlled studio, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What gets measured gets done.But, Goodhart's Law "When a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42870690</guid></item><item><title>26.

I 'member seeing this video originally on MTV at like 3AM. Instantly captivated. I'm a huge fan to this day, but there's something uniquely special about all the Phase 1 stuff: the album, the B-sides (or “G” Sides lol), the explorable Flash Kong Studios site, the DVD, Jamie Hewlett's art†, the fact that the eponymous album as originally released is 55:55 (iykyk)There's also a track on Deltron 3030 (an album I liked a lot more when it was new than I do now) which I have tagged as “feat. 2-D” instead of “feat. Damon Albarn” because come on :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxd_eDTbBMQIt's also kinda funny that 2D's entire existence is just a stupid pun on Robert Del (lol) Naja a.k.a. “3D” (a.k.a.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of programming languages, focusing on the transition from C to Clojure. It highlights how Clojure aims to combine the efficiency and performance of C with the simplicity and expressiveness of functional programming. The piece explores the advantages of Clojure, such as its emphasis on immutability and its powerful features for concurrency, while also addressing the challenges developers might face when adopting this new language. Overall, the article presents Clojure as a promising option for modern software development, appealing to those seeking to leverage the best aspects of both C and functional programming paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very excited for Jank, I wish the creator well.If I could make one tiny plea, it would be to focus on tooling too, and ensuring the experience for someone trying Jank out is as smooth as possible. Don't assume everyone is already set up with paredit and can fire off emacs chords without a thought. I suspect that Jank will be of particular interest to C++ programmers, many of whom are used to a very different dev paradigm.The Clojure community has done a great job at trying to smooth out the rough edges of Lisp tooling, and ensure there are on-ramps for newcomers (e.g. things like Calva for VS Code). I hope Jank keeps this up, because those first impressions really do matter. I'd hate to watch people bounce off Jank because they get stuck on trying to figure emacs out, or because they get frustrated trying to keep parentheses matched in Notepad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somehow I completely missed this. I mostly stopped using Clojure solely because of the JVM madness (yes, I know about babaskha, won’t use it due to the GraalVM dependency and possible Oracle tentacles lurking there) and have fallen back to things like Hy (which can be clunky but at least runs everywhere I have a Python interpreter). Something that has better Clojure-like syntax and uses LLVM aid very appealing, provided it can do (and serve) HTTP requests sanely and has enough batteries included.Any good pointers to existing libraries to get a feel for the ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That was beautiful. Nicely done, and congratulations on your restomod A1000!I’ve heard people describe it as a 16 bit computer a few times lately though and it always catches me off guard. It was usually referred to as a 32 bit computer at the time, and defensibly so.Some of its implementation details were 16 bit, like the data bus and ALU, but they were largely invisible to users and programmers. Assembly code used 32 bit math instructions, even if the CPU executed them in 2 steps. It had a flat 32 bit address space, although only 24 address lines were implemented (kind of like how not all 64 address lines are available on a 64 bit CPU today). Registers were 32 bits wide. And later 68K CPUs could run A1000 software on pure 32 bit CPUs natively with no emulation or trickery.Credit it with those extra 16 bits. It earned them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My father bought me an Amiga 1000 at a Federated Group store in late 1985.Coming from a C64, my mind was blown by the Amiga's graphics and the multi-tasking. I could run the amazing RoboCity animation demo and then drag it down half way and see my Workbench.Marble Madness on the Amiga looked and sounded just like the arcade.1985 was a magical year in general for me, but a big part of that magic was conjured by the Amiga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My career path was pretty much set in stone when I was introduced to an Amiga2000 with a Video Toaster. I watched so many different pieces of equipment get replaced by that one card inside this computer. The replaced equipment dollar value dwarfed the price of the Amiga + Toaster setup. Eventually, we upgraded the CPU from the stock 68010 to a 68040 with another expansion card which was an incredible difference.This happened the summer between my junior and senior year in high school, and I spent every day that summer learning everything about what I could do with that Toaster. By the time I graduated, I was a pretty decent technical director being able to handle the lower 3rds, camera switching, and running tape playback (and rarely used those skills later).The Amiga will always hold a special place for me. Any post like this will also keep me from doing work for longer time than it takes to read as I always go down a bit of nostalgia rabbit hole after reading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865867</guid></item><item><title>29.

The piece highlights user frustrations and the potential implications for device performance and usability while criticizing Google's handling of the firmware update process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, (soon to be ex) Pixel 4a user here. Regardless of why this update has happened, the way Google have went about this update is sketchy at best, and deceitful at worst. To be plain: this phone has been EOL for 1½ years now. This update has appeared out of the blue and specifically decimates the battery + charging capabilities.My most charitable view is that Google have found a major fault with the Pixel 4a battery and want to mitigate a repeat of the Galaxy Note 7 without saying it outright and causing a panic.My least charitable view (and immediate reaction) is that they're purposely ruining a viable budget phone to make more sales.Either of these are terrible. At no point has Google came out and stated -why- they're pushing this update in the first place. And as someone who hasn't updated I'd really like to know if my phone presents an immediate threat (and I'm sure Governments and airlines would also like to know) before I remotely consider an update that'll practically destroy my device.On top of this, within a day of being notified about this update, Google drastically raised the price of new Pixels on their store. Again if I'm charitable it could just be automatic global market price updates, but that goes out the window when Google must have prepared this update, FAQs, support plans, etc, then released it just before said price updates. The $100 discount recourse doesn't go far when the 8a jumped from £379 to £499. It's hard not to feel suspicious about it.While I'm here, I did briefly write about my experiences with the 4a, though I'm far from a competent tech writer: https://callmeo.live/blog/ode-to-the-pixel-4a/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm (we all are) constantly reminded to update our phones to latest available updates, but sh*t like this is what teaches users to instead disable and ignore updates indefinitely, under the premise of "if it works don't touch it" (addendum: "... because most probably an update will break it")And here I am, ignoring updates on my Pixel 6a since October 2024 (there were reports of crashes or bricking, what a surprise) and planning to keep doing that for the foreseeable future.Sucks having to choose between a potentially (even likely, seeing the trend) broken device or an unsecured one. Pick your poison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can revert this if you unlock your bootloader:https://xdaforums.com/t/undo-the-january-2025-update-without...(EDIT: Just to be clear, and which is also mentioned in that post: unlocking the bootloader will reset the device. If your device is already unlocked though, you will be able to keep the data.)Of course, I would just advise to switch to LineageOS directly, since Google has stopped providing security updates for the Pixel 4a already in August 2023. I've run LineageOS for years on the Pixel 4a and it has worked pretty much perfectly for me:https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/sunfish/Android 15 (LineageOS 22) was just released for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865619</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delicious Library was the start of a gilded age of Mac shareware focused on style over substance.&gt; In the past year or so, Mac development had shifted from applications providing new functionality that appeared at the dawn of OS X to applications (and ideas) built around flash and sizzle, with plenty of marketing hype to fuel the fire. his had created something of a toxic atmosphere in the Mac development world. A rift between the old school, with its plain but functional apps, and the new school of flashy but frivolous apps, has developed. ... I dubbed this new school “The Delicious Generation”.https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/the-delicious-gene...Apple adopted a similar interface for Newsstand on iOS and it seemed to be widely reviled during the pushback against skeuomorphism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Momentarily mistook this for https://del.icio.us/, but related only by name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I miss skeuomorphism. With good UX it makes great UI. It's weird considering I have my head inside a terminal most of the time but I was fond of those UI.I wonder if formal studies exist that measure things like "discoverbility" or productivity for normal users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860141</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article expresses the author's strong stance against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance or modify human characteristics and experiences. The writer shares personal anecdotes highlighting the value of authenticity and imperfections in life, emphasizing that AI should not attempt to "polish" or change who we are. The piece critiques the societal pressure to conform to idealized standards and advocates for embracing individuality and authenticity in a world increasingly influenced by technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s like my whole computer is a toddler screaming “LET ME DO IT!” every time I try to create something.Every autocorrect or auto suggestion ever has felt like this to me, but the volume has been turned up to 11. The otherwise drab Adobe Reader is covered with colorful sparkly buttons and popups suggesting I need not even read the document because it can give me “insights.” First, no you may not ready my proprietary document, nor do I suspect most people using this particular software - I only have it for digital signatures - have permission to share IP with a third party. But mostly, it can sometimes be a useful tool, and the fact everyone is shoving it in my face reeks of desperation.The tech industry is in real trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obviously the AI version is bland and terrible, but arguably more importantly it has also completely changed the meaning of the message. The AI version:- apologizes- implies the recipient was "promised" this email as a "response" to something- blames a hectic schedule- invites questionsNone of this was in or was even implied in the original. This is not a "polished" version, it's just a straight-up different email. I thought that style transfer while maintaining meaning was one of the few things LLMs can be good at, but this example fails even that low bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no way in hell anyone who knows me would get that email and not think I’d been abductedThis person cares about not putting up a fake identity. That's pretty cool, but social media has exposed that a large number of people are perfectly fine presenting an illusion. People will have no shame passing off well written   things as an output of their talent and hard work. Digital makeup has no bounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864854</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;Keymapper is an open-source project hosted on GitHub that enables users to remap keyboard keys, allowing for customized key bindings to enhance user experience and productivity. The repository provides a user-friendly interface for setting up key mappings, supporting various operating systems. It includes detailed instructions for installation and usage, alongside examples to demonstrate the functionality. The project is aimed at developers and users looking to tailor their keyboard layouts for specific applications or workflows, and it encourages community contributions and feedback for ongoing improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I got this really weird thing on MacOS ...I was a Windows user since like windows 3.0. With ISO German Keyboards. I never had to retrain my muscle memory to anything else, until I decided its time to buy a Macbook about 1.5 years ago.Since then I'm struggling with Karabiner to get the key mappings right.And its not just command -&gt; control to map cmd+c to ctrl+c for copy etc.It's also weird things like the ^ or the &lt;&gt; not being mapped on the right part of the keyboard. This is especially apparent (sometimes?) when I use an external keyboard (e.g. the sharkoon purewriter, but not limited to). It's a really weird issue, because on the internal mac keyboard its mapped correctly, while on the external one its not. Then I go into karabiner, select the external keyboard and remap _just for the external keyboard_ the few keys are not mapped correctly. And then weeks go by, it works, and suddenly the keyboard keys are correct without the mapping and the remapping now is the problem, so I delete them.It's not bothering enough to write an issue on karabiner. Heck, I'm even convinced its not even a karabiner issue, its something else. But I'm not deep enough into the mac system to understand where I should even look, if its even possible.If someone is using houmain to remap keys, can you maybe share a config that would map MacOS keys back Windows for someone who has a deep ingrained windows-style muscle memory? I just briefly looked through the docs, not sure if I missed it, but can houmain just remap keys for certain keyboards, but leave others unmapped?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if this will finally give a solid, cross-platform way to make the Caps Lock key work as it should: press for escape, hold for control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"cross-platform" is interesting. I've been using Keyboard Maestro on MacOS (highly recommended, it does a lot of useful stuff) and this, in combination with UHK keyboards (https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com) and their switchable keymaps, has been working well for me so far. But, getting something like Keyboard Maestro on Linux would be quite useful indeed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42871040</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The Society for Technical Communication (STC) is a professional association dedicated to the advancement of technical communication as a profession. It provides resources, networking opportunities, and professional development to enhance the skills of technical communicators. STC offers various certifications, online courses, and events, including annual conferences, to help members stay updated on industry trends and best practices. The organization aims to support professionals in creating clear and effective communication in various fields, fostering community engagement and collaboration among its members.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working in this space for a long time, where I'm one of the co-founders of Write the Docs: https://www.writethedocs.org/ -- we focus more on software docs.The view from the industry is basically that STC was a bit behind the times, and was slowly dwindling in terms of reach and value. They still had some active chapters, magazine, and academic journal that provided value for folks, but membership wasn't as valuable as it had been.They have been around a long time, and had a wider purview that WTD, focusing on many different types of technical writing. They had members in industries like Automotive, Engineering, and Aerospace, as well as Software.The best way to think about them is something like the ACM in the software industry. They have been taken over by more current community approaches in various areas (eg. Pycon), but also still doing some more traditional stuff that adds value but isn't as relevant to day-to-day practitioners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a member of an STC chapter in grad school and I went to a bunch of meetings and networking events hoping to get some practical career advice from more experienced technical writers.At no point did it feel like anyone in the org could (or would) actually help me in the transition from grad school to technical writing work. It was a really disheartening experience. It does not surprise me that membership has waned over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked as a technical writer earlier in this century and was a member of the STC for a year. In my case, that was a year too long. Like more than a few other technical writers I knew and worked with, I didn't get any value out of my membership. I got more out of the (at the time) burgeoning technical communication blogosphere than I did from the STCThe STC, at least in my view, was several steps behind the times. It was a large organization that was too slow to adapt to changing realities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867324</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The Cardan grille is a device used for encoding messages that involves a grid-like pattern with cutouts that allow certain letters or words to be visible while obscuring others. This technique is part of a broader category of steganography, where information is hidden in plain sight. The grille consists of a rectangular piece of card with strategically placed holes, and text can be revealed by placing it over written material. This method has historical significance in encryption practices and has been adapted for various forms of communication throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This would be a perfect fit for a LLM (albeit a bit complicated by byte-pair tokenization and decoder models rather than bidirectional). You can clamp the grille words, and just generate samples with those as requirements until they reach a good likelihood and are highly fluent and indistinguishable from non-message carrying text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even more impressive is the lecture of the life of Cardano himself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Cars…Cars on…Carson City.”

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an update on the development of Dart macros and their implications for data serialization. It discusses recent advancements in the Dart programming language, particularly focusing on macro functionality which allows for enhanced code generation and manipulation. The author highlights how these features can improve data serialization processes, making it easier to manage data formats and structures. Additionally, the post outlines the challenges encountered during implementation and seeks community feedback to refine these tools, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in evolving Dart's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, I work on Dart and was one of the people working on this feature. Reposting my Reddit comment to provide a little context:I'm bummed that it's canceled because of the lost time, but also relieved that we decided to cancel it. I feel it was the right decision.We knew the macros feature was a big risky gamble when we took a shot at it. But looking at other languages, I saw that most started out with some simple metaprogramming feature (preprocessor macros in C/C++, declarative macros in Rust, etc.) and then later outgrew them and added more complex features (C++ template metaprogramming, procedural macros in Rust). I was hoping we could leapfrog that whole process and get to One Metaprogramming Feature to Rule Them All.Alas, it is really hard to be able to introspect on the semantics of a program while it is still being modified in a coherent way without also seriously regressing compiler performance. It's probably not impossible, but it increasingly felt like the amount of work to get there was unbounded.I'm sad we weren't able to pull it off but I'm glad that we gave it a shot. We learned a lot about the problem space and some of the hidden sharp edges.I'm looking forward to working on a few smaller more targeted features to deal with the pain points we hoped to address with macros (data classes, serialization, stateful widget class verbosity, code generation UX, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always feel better about the stewardship of a project when you see a thoughtfully written reason for saying no to a feature, especially when there’s already sunk cost. Props to the team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is good news. The dart language has been getting more complicated without corresponding quality of life improvements. A first class record object without messing around with macros would be a great start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42871867</guid></item><item><title>36.

(to be clear - I find the &lt;think&gt; section useful, but it also means waiting for more tokens)Personally - I end up moving down to lower quality models (quants/less params) until I hit about 15 tokens/second.   For chat, that seems to be the magical spot where I stop caring and it's "fast enough" to keep me engaged.For inline code helpers (ex - copilot) you really need to be up near 30 tokens/second to make it feel fast enough to be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865575</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "dead games," which refers to video games that have lost their player base and online support, resulting in diminished or nonexistent community activity. It explores various factors that contribute to a game becoming "dead," including poor updates, lack of developer support, and competition from other games. The author reflects on personal experiences with such games, emphasizing the sense of nostalgia and disappointment associated with watching once-thriving communities fade away. The piece serves as a commentary on the ephemeral nature of gaming popularity and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I definitely advocate for Ross Scott's effort behind https://www.stopkillinggames.com, there are still many titles I think that really don't qualify for the level of effort to keep them preserved. I am too old for Roblox, I have tried some Fortnite, but in my day shakes stick, new ideas were expressed through some kind of mod. DOTA and CS are exceptional examples of this.Not every idea has the automatic inertia it needs to be the next big hit.I also speak as fan of games like Deceive Inc and First Class Trouble, I applaud Garry's effort in this case. The game engines and distribution platforms make it a lot easier to push your idea as a product instead of being just that, an idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting game like this is Space Hulk (2013).A great game imho. Perfectly true to the board game and fun to play. Some negative reviews due to being a digital board game but it’s right up my alley personally.I bought it on steam back then. Still installable and runs but you can’t buy it anymore as the license expired. In fact you can’t easily obtain this at all now. The owners couldn’t give it away even if they wanted to.https://delistedgames.com/space-hulk-2013/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often wondered similarly for movies, especially CGI. So much time and money is spent to make complicated environments and intricate character models -- the end result gets preserved in the final cut, but what happens to the original assets? Do VFX studios typically maintain archives of past material, or does it all get wiped after each project? I'd think it would be handy to have for remasters, sequels, etc., even if they don't really care about preservation for preservation's sake. Physical props end up in museums or fetch a high price at auction from private collectors, but whither Avengers_Endgame_Thanos_final_final_FINAL.obj?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42870230</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Jevons Paradox refers to the observation that as technological advancements increase the efficiency with which a resource is utilized, the overall consumption of that resource may actually rise rather than fall. Named after the British economist William Stanley Jevons, who noted this phenomenon in relation to coal consumption in the 19th century, the paradox highlights the counterintuitive relationship between efficiency and consumption. It suggests that improvements in efficiency can lead to lower costs and increased demand, ultimately resulting in greater resource use. The concept has significant implications for environmental policy and resource management, as it underscores the complexity of achieving conservation goals through efficiency alone.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Energy-efficient lighting, such as LED bulbs, has become a popular solution to reduce energy consumption. However, it serves as a notable example of the Jevons Paradox. While LEDs significantly lower the cost of lighting per unit, this reduction often leads to increased usage. For instance, people may install more lights in their homes or businesses, use them for longer durations, or adopt decorative and outdoor lighting more extensively. As a result, the total energy consumption for lighting has not decreased significantly despite the efficiency improvements.This felt false to me, LED bulbs are generally 10x more efficient, so the average number of lights would have had to increase 10 fold, and this is ignoring the savings from not having AC cool those other 50 watts a bulb that went to heat.So I took a look at the source, which doesn't actually have a source and just links to another white paper that claims light pollution increased, but is unclear about how much and due to what. Perhaps that whitepaper links to another whitepaper, but this is where I stopped.Kind of makes me question how often I blindly trust Wikipedia, though this point in particular is pretty minor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intuition behind this is that people who had a usecase for the tech but were locked out because they couldn't afford it, or didn't believe it was worth it usecase can be engineers or researchers. Some of these people may perform better than expected causing a gap in true market value which is filled when they scale up to their new sizeRelated: Jenson's Paradox: The more you buy, The more you save&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is IMO a spefic case of the induced demand concept (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42863808</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;California's Attorney General has warned artificial intelligence companies that many of their practices could potentially violate state laws. This advisory emphasizes that AI firms must be transparent about their data usage and adhere to existing legal frameworks, particularly concerning consumer privacy and anti-discrimination. The AG's statement highlights the importance of accountability and ethical standards in AI development, urging companies to consider the legal implications of their technology and its impact on individuals and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

that appear to represent people, events, and utterances that never existed or occurred would likely be
deceptive.4&gt; Likewise, in many contexts it would likely be deceptive to fail to disclose that AI has been used to
create a piece of media.Under this logic a company making pencils is illegal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though he’s right, Rob Bonta is going to get himself fired, while Scott Wiener will write a bill legalizing training on non expressly licensed data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865174</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even before the rise of AI music, they started "customizing" playlists based on the algorithm, so that you see different songs compared to someone else who subscribes to the same playlist.This was one of the reasons why I left Spotify. There are hundreds of posts about this issue on the Spotify community site, e.g.https://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/Option-to...https://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/Spotify-P...https://community.spotify.com/t5/Your-Library/I-Sent-a-Playl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My Spotify experience was poisoned as soon as I signed up some 8 years ago to try it; I realized there was no way to remove the popular but garbage music from the dashboard. It was essentially advertising space for slop. So I cancelled my subscription within 1-2 days. I instead ended up going with Youtube Music which doesn't try to push propaganda on me and instead either shows me what I have in my library already that I have saved and/or uploaded myself, and music that they think I'd enjoy based off of my library.Prior to this like many other people I was a hardcore Grooveshark fan/user. There were other services, but their names escape me at the moment. I was looking for a replacement and platforms kept coming and going, but Youtube Music (for all of Google's faults) seem to have stayed all this time. I'm still using it, it's still not pushing slop on me. I'm happy.As an aside, accepting that I'm in the minority here speaking on behalf of them, I am not someone who would write a blog post announcing that I'm leaving some shitty platform. I'll just cancel my sub and move on. I don't need nor want to grandstand regardless of AI or just people's shit taste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the headline was mocking Shopify, not Spotify.  It shows how little creativity we have in tech company naming.I wonder which suffix is more popular, -ify, -ly, or -r.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860113</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses remarks made by TSMC founder Morris Chang, who stated that Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed skepticism about Intel's capabilities as a semiconductor foundry. Chang implies that Cook believes Intel lacks the necessary expertise to compete effectively in the foundry market, a space where TSMC has established itself as a leader. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and competition in the tech industry regarding semiconductor manufacturing, with a particular focus on Apple’s partnerships and Intel’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2011).  And Cook was right.  I worked at Intel for a few years during that decade and the foundry efforts were just not set up for success; in my area, they hired a bunch of new people, put up a firewall between us internal folks and the foundry folks, then without any guidance turned them loose.  I was not even allowed to talk to them to troubleshoot equipment issues.  They also got all of the equipment that we’d rejected for various reasons like poor process control, so they were newbies with worse equipment trying to start up a new group without help beyond what vendors would provide (for $$$)I have no insight into the customer facing side&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This situation has been and maybe always will be common. Those who view themselves as integrated manufacturers of *products* often cannot equally package, deliver, and sell their component *services*. No matter how good those services are at delivering the end product—and sometimes they are completely world-class or genuinely unique—they're almost always highly designed, refined, and evolved over years to map to the specific end products and their one business. They are NOT designed, refined, or evolved to be reusable, retargetable capabilities for all interested parties.By any rights, the major systems manufacturers of the 2000s—Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM, Sun Microsystems—should have had an enormous leg up in becoming the planetary scale, "red shift" cloud computing providers of today. Let's kick major operating environment vendors of that era in for good measure—Microsoft, Red Hat, VMware. Maybe even Oracle and SAP. They had the technical capabilities, the economies of scale, the vendor ecosystems, the customer relationships, the financial might. "Permission to win." Yet, only a few have made it. Microsoft has made the transition with Azure, but it's been a long hard pull. Maybe a few participation trophies for IBM and Oracle. But as a group, where are they, cloud-wise? Not too impressive that AWS and Google and others that had no classic "required assets" or "permission to win" have wiped them off the playing field or kicked them deep into the "others" bin.You can call that classic innovator's dilemma, and there's a lot to that. It's insanely, unfathomably hard to disrupt your own current successful business for new delivery models and aspirations. But there's something else as well: services and products are different beasts. They take different mindsets, expectations, business models, and metrics. All the best to Intel in becoming that new thing, a service provider. But it not just a side gig or slight extension. It's a radically different thing, and it's no wonder the highly successful product Intel of 2011 wasn't also a good service provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;TSMC founder says Tim Cook told him in 2011 that Intel did not know how to be a foundryThat is the Original Title. It could be edited as  "Tim Cook told TSMC in 2011 that Intel did not know how to be a foundry" - That would still have been accurate with the date on.Now the title has been editorialised, and meant or imply something else. Like most of the comments are already suggesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868531</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the pervasive use of smartphones and social media can negatively impact individuals' self-esteem and body image, leading to feelings of unattractiveness and decreased sexual desire. It highlights that constant exposure to curated images on social media can create unrealistic standards, fostering comparison and dissatisfaction. The author emphasizes the importance of disconnecting from digital distractions to cultivate a healthier self-image and improve emotional well-being. The piece advocates for mindfulness and self-acceptance as key strategies for overcoming the adverse effects of technology on personal confidence and sexual attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised by the negative comments here so far that sound more indignant or "called out" than anything else.The article's argument is not only thoughtfully made and unusually well-written, in my opinion it's correct. There's nothing sexy about essentially staring at something in your hand for an hour or more every day. Smartphones provide a level of private immersion in silent, "socially-flavored" dopamine consumption that's antithetical to robust, vibrant socialization. Which is decidedly not sexy.taps add comment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The time pressures of every day life, which has gotten more complicated, are probably why we gravitate towards instant gratification more often. You don't have the time or energy to go to the library for books on a work day, especially with a commute. Same with any other activity. Working hard to finish your work ahead of time results in more work. Innovation's reward is not more free time, it's more work of a different kind.Blaming phones is a distraction. If it weren't phones, we'd still be couch potatoes lazily scrolling through channels to find something to watch. The core issue is we only have time/energy these days for our job's work and the lazy resting which seeks instant gratification.Next time someone's unemployed, try doing nothing but social media for 8 hours a day, 7 days a week on a couch and see you'll eventually get bored.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a tremendous piece. It rings so very true.I was 18 in 1990. I'm undoutebdly rose-tinting it but it was indeed edgy and weird and loaded and cool and unknown and just basically fucking brilliant.I look at my teen / 20's kids now and although they're brilliant and doing rad things and out there in the world being great - they're also slightly reserved, spoilt for choice, their generation less able to take hard knocks or deal with unknowns. It's kinda sad I think. Here's hoping we'll find ways to get back to more of what's actually real and important and well, sexy...!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864595</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a mysterious thing how the influencers of various kind
in software engineering, have to jump from something new to
something new. Even if the "new" new has been created a long 
time ago.Using old systems is in no way fashionable.
Everyone wants the latest whatnot on their resume to be more attractive
for future job opportunities.We are forever stuck in a fast fashion web.I like to think about typed vs non typed langauges 
For a long time they both existed in relativ harmony 
(much more so than emacs vs vi).Then it became the THE THING to use non typed langues.
In part because "having to write the type in the
code was far too much work".We got young software developers who had never used a 
type langauge but who had joined the "church of non typed".Skipping ahead, some influencer discovers typed languages
and how it solves many problems. 
What about that.Choices are good.
We can make informed choices as to what tool makes the 
most sense in the context of what we are trying to solve.
(and its fit with the team and the legacy code etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a management principle here that the tech world doesn't seem to have internalised yet. It is linked to the basic problem that we can't measure programmer productivity.Software tends to be modularised based on a company's management structure. What the components do tends to reflect the manager. When the manager changes, the software either starts to change too or succumbs to bitrot. It is pretty normal for tech companies to start listing after the original founders move on - even a company like Google or Microsoft with money and technically strong individual employees starts to mean regress as new managers come in who have a different and murkier vision than the founders.With luck the transition can be from excellence to a different form of excellence, but the basic strategy people seem to have that management is to be encoded in the org structure and bureaucratic processes doesn't seem to work at preserving high-performing tech companies. It depends on specific people in key leadership positions. Because if they get swapped out there is no way to measure the productivity change less effective managers foist on developers until the company has notably mean regressed years later.I'd bet something like this happened here. A team lead or someone was swapped out and replaced with someone who thought differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There is clearly a failure of engineering leadership. I am still puzzled why.I personally believe it’s lack of good engineering leadership and it’s only getting worse at this point. I’ve experienced a fair share of technical leaders without enough technical background and/or experience - people/leadership skills is equally important imho, but people with both are  hard to find (scarce resource) and it seems like it’s often the tech side that gets compromised.I think one of the reasons is the IT industry is simply growing too fast, meaning we have a very small pool of people with many years of experience and a very large pool of people with less experience (compared to other industries). But we do need technical leaders, hence the compromise (need?) to pick people with less experience. Unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42862288</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the effectiveness of code suggestions generated by large language models (LLMs) and emphasizes the principle of "less is more." It argues that providing concise, focused suggestions can enhance the coding experience and improve productivity for developers. The piece suggests that overly complex or numerous code suggestions can overwhelm users and lead to confusion, while streamlined and relevant recommendations can foster better understanding and quicker implementation. By prioritizing quality over quantity in code suggestions, LLMs can better support developers in their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;XCode's assistant AI suggestions are 99% ridiculous, often don't make sense, don't compile, or have nothing to do with my project. Every once in a while it suggests a line or so that is fine. The biggest issue is I want code completion and it appends extra items that make no sense at all, requiring that I either backspace a bunch, or have to use a mouse to pick from the menu. I haven't used Copilot or one of the others, so don't know if this is normal or Apple's is just stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So even the LLMs want to keep doing just easy stuff given a choice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This matches my experience working with LLMs. I've built several applications that require an LLM to consider several factors or "zoom levels," and I have yet to work with a model that can do that in a single shot.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised I'd see this on here!The article doesn't do justice for the Bhat Museum in Kargil. It's really cool seeing the proto-globalization that was increasingly common for us residents in the High Himalayas in the 19th and 20th century.It also is difficult to describe how unique Inner/Central Asian culture is due to the syncretic nature of trade, as well as the isolation that arises due to valleys being cut off for several months of the year.This lead to some interesting cultural artifacts such as marrying off daughters outside of your valley (to prevent incest), identifying a person's valley based on their surname, relic populations speaking language isolates, and much older cultural traditons remaining alive while dying out in much more connected and populated neighborsMy great-grandad also had stories like that of Munshi Bhat's of the various mountain trails and paths that connected Jammu, Manali, Leh, Kargil, Skardu, Kashgar, Karglik, Murghab, Changtang plains, etc.There was a series on MTV India called "Way Back Home" [0]
that showed a lot of these small towns and the interconnections (albeit primarily concentrating on Upper Himachal and Leh).Also, the old NH1 highway via Zojila is getting deprecated for an all-weather highway via Zanskar. A similar thing happened in neighboring Himachal with the Atal Tunnel connected Kullu Valley with Spiti Valley.I have some recommendations of good museums and towns/villages to visit on the Indian side (Ladakh, Himachal, Jammu Division) if interested.[0] - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-6C9zIEdU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Five photos of mountains.A single photo of a museum housing the "ancient discovery" (crates full of fancy goods from all over the world).Not a single photo of a specific item from the "ancient discovery" (crates full of fancy goods from all over the world).Journalism. BBC.(Also, implying that goods from New York were being traded on the Silk Road is a huge stretch.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought was that someone discovered Ross Ulbricht was freed and expecting to put Silk Road back on the map :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858187</guid></item><item><title>50.

What I would love to be able to do is ask for a task and have the agent figure out what servers and tools it needs to accomplish that task directly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP - congrats on this launch! I think there are a lot of useful bits here, especially the communication abstractions for MCP and having clear recipes to implement patterns mentioned by Anthropic team is a big plus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks very nice, and obviously needed in hindsight.I would love to see a Typescript/node port of this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867050</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the upcoming introduction of the Temporal API in JavaScript, which aims to address the shortcomings of the existing Date object by providing a more comprehensive and user-friendly way to handle dates and times. It highlights the API's key features, including better support for time zones, date arithmetic, and immutability, which will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of date and time manipulations in applications. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of the Temporal API in making JavaScript development more straightforward and reliable for developers, as it resolves many common pitfalls associated with date handling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Temporal is great. I've been using it for a while in production using a polyfill [1], and it solves all issues I've encountered with the old Date() API (which is a lot).It clearly takes inspiration from other high-quality time libraries such as chrono in Rust and Joda Time in Java and combines them into a nice API that's pretty comfortable to use.Yes, it is a bit more complex to handle since it separates time into naive time, instant and zoned time. But by experience, developers only confront complexity when they are forced to, and time _is_ complex.If you want to do the operation "add one day to this timestamp", you _must_ decide whether that timestamp is local to a specific timezone and which one. Otherwise you'll get a bug twice per year due to DST, or when the user switches time zones, or when you deploy on a server with a different timezone.It even solves the serialization issue of the difference between a "fixed-offset" timestamp (e.g. 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00) and one in a specific timezone (e.g. Europe/Paris).[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man, that took some time to find in the docs:Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.withTimeZone() [0], which allows to convert from one timezone to another   const meetingTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(
     "2021-08-01T12:00[America/New_York]",
   );

   const meetingTimeInParis = meetingTime.withTimeZone("Europe/Paris");
 
   console.log(meetingTimeInParis.toString()); // 2021-08-01T18:00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]


To me, timezone translations as well as durations are such an essential thing which libraries must handle, and it's nice to see that Temporal handles both. But it looks like Temporal.Duration doesn't offer a custom `format` function, for example `duration.format('H\hmm\m')` or something like that to format a duration into 1h03m.[0] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are quite a few things marinating in the TC39 pot right now. This is one that I wish would ship sooner, rather than later. I do recognize that it takes dev effort (on the part of v8, JSC, and SpiderMonkey engineers) to get the major browsers to support any of these new features. So I truly appreciate all that folks are doing to move the ball forward. The impatient person in me is cheering, "now get Records and Tuples going too! You can skip that silly Pipe-syntax war if you want!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876840</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of the financial markets reacting to potential shifts in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly amidst rising inflation concerns. It explores how investors are adjusting their strategies in anticipation of interest rate changes, the impact on various asset classes, and the overall economic outlook.

This is obviously extremely silly, because that's exactly how OpenAI got all of its training data in the first place - by scraping other peoples' data off the internet."DeepSeek trained on our outputs, and so their claims of replicating o1-level performance from scratch are not really true" This is at least plausibly a valid claim. The DeepSeek R1 paper shows that distillation is really powerful (e.g. they show Llama models get a huge boost by finetuning on R1 outputs), and if it were the case that DeepSeek were using a bunch of o1 outputs to train their model, that would legitimately cast doubt on the narrative of training efficiency. But that's a separate question from whether it's somehow unethical to use OpenAI's data the same way OpenAI uses everyone else's data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “It’s also extremely hard to rally a big talented research team to charge a new hill in the fog together,” he added. “This is the key to driving progress forward.”Well I think DeepSeek releasing it open source and on an MIT license will rally the big talent. The open sourcing of a new technology has always driven progress in the past.The last paragraph too is where OpenAi seems to be focusing their efforts..&gt; we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models ..&gt; ... we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.So they'll go for getting DeepSeek banned like TikTok was now that a precedent has been set ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42861475</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of ground planes in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design, explaining their functionality and benefits in reducing noise and improving signal integrity. It covers the concepts of grounding, the role of ground planes in creating a stable reference for electrical signals, and the effects of improper grounding on circuit performance. Additionally, the author emphasizes best practices for integrating ground planes into PCB layouts to optimize functionality and minimize electromagnetic interference. The piece serves as a guide for designers looking to improve their understanding of PCB grounding techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Other than increased miniaturization, the most striking change is the use of copper pours [...] Why did we start doing this?We've been doing something a lot like this for as long as I can remember.Back in the 1990s if there were any big unused copper areas on your PCB you'd mask them to save on etching acid - a gallon of acid would have a lifetime measured in square inches of copper removed, and the less copper you removed, the longer your acid would last.Meanwhile, a lot of DIY etching processes were very basic. Sure, you could get translucent acid and a transparent bath and heat it to a controlled temperature and run bubbles through it and so on. But if you were on a budget, some room temperature ferric chloride in an old ice cream container would get the job done. And getting the etch resist onto the board? You could draw it by hand with special pens, use transfers, there were special printer toner transfer papers, or you could DIY UV photoresist using printable projector transparencies and the sun as your UV source.This was not a super-scientific, tightly controlled process.If you had narrow traces and narrow gaps on one part of your PCB, and large areas of copper to remove on another? Well, if you left it in the acid long enough to remove that large area, could be the narrow traces get etched away too.So masking off any large areas meant all the copper getting etched was about the same width - thus compensating for the poorly controlled etching process.Of course, these days professional PCB manufacturing is orders of magnitude cheaper than it used to be. When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The return current on the back is free to spread out, but in practice, it will prefer the path of least resistance — i.e., the shortest line between the two vias.This is a bit misleading. It does preferentially flow along the shortest path, but not exclusively. It will indeed spread out. It takes all paths with a current proportional to their resistance, not just the shortest path. The percentage of total current that isn't flowing directly along the shortest path is still very significant.Think of it as a bunch of resistors in parallel. The shortest path might be 0.1ohm, and the longest path 10x longer at 1ohm, but current will be flowing along both of those paths. If 1A is flowing down the shortest path, you will still have 100mA down the 10x length path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my all time favorite videos (one of the few that I rewatch once per year) is "The Extreme Importance of PC Board Stack-Up with Rick Hartley". It's fantastic.https://resources.altium.com/p/the-extreme-importance-of-pc-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874885</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;A commercial jetliner collided with a police helicopter near Reagan National Airport, resulting in significant damage to the helicopter but no reported injuries among its crew. The incident occurred during the helicopter's routine patrol in the airspace. Authorities are investigating the collision, and statements from both the police and aviation officials indicate a focus on safety and coordination in air traffic to prevent future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not that being near DC affords me any kind of right to an opinion, but:Given the uptick in near miss incidents across the US the last few years, this is the kind of incident that should've been entirely avoidable through changes in policy from these past events but is also apparently the only kind that can spur along policy changes. I can see a world where the fault is on the VH-60, but absent more information, it would surprise me less to hear that it's the fault of the tower.Knowing where AA5342 was in its approach, I see no possibility of the jet being at fault.https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL5342I'm drawing a lot of early conclusions but it's mostly because I'm just not surprised. Angry as someone who flies a bunch, but not surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To put this in perspective, this is the first fatal crash of a US commercial airliner in 16 years (Colgan Air Flight 3407 on February 12, 2009) and the first fatal commercial airliner crash in the United States in 12 years (since Asiana Airlines Flight 214 on July 6, 2013).We like to throw shade at Boeing, the FAA etc, but this is still an incredible accomplishment, especially given the explosive growth of traffic over those years.  Back in the 1970s and 1980s, there were far fewer flights but multiple crashes every year was the norm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It wasn't a police chopper, it was a military VH-60, also known as a "White Hawk" [1]. It's a VIP transport helicopter, the same type that is used to transport the president.~The flight track of the helicopter [2] starts at a property in McLean, VA (edited to remove likely inaccurate info)~The chopper was based out of Fort Belvoir, and based on similar past flight tracks, looks like it probably took off from there too. CNN is reporting that there were 3 soldiers onboard, and no VIPs.1: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_VH-60N_White_Hawk2: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ae313d&amp;lat=38.952&amp;lon=-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874301</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "Antiqua et Nova" addresses the significance and role of the Roman Catholic Church's liturgy, emphasizing its continuity and evolution over the centuries. It outlines the Church's commitment to preserving the rich traditions of the liturgy while also adapting to contemporary needs and contexts. The text reflects on the theological foundations of liturgical practice, articulates the importance of active participation by the faithful, and underscores the necessity of liturgical reform to better foster spiritual growth. Overall, it serves as guidance for clergy and laity concerning the celebration of the liturgy in a way that honors both tradition and modernity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to appreciate how well written and thought out this was. I have spent countless hours reading over ethics on AI, especially from Big Tech sources, but this note is leaps beyond. I compare this to the disastrous letter that effectively knee-capped American AI all while proposing flimsy AI ethics within about 500 words (https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experime...). This should be another red flag when America's $500 Billion Stargate project is being led by people including Sam Altman and Larry Ellison, who are singing doomsday prophecies while the Vatican is making sincere efforts to understand AI.I'm really caught admiring this and think this may very well be the AI Magna Carta. There are so many gems and while many of the sources are based on Catholicism, there is also an incredible depth of research, even going into "On the foundational role of language in shaping understanding, cf. M. Heidegger." The note also builds upon numerous different discussions from the Vatican including this supplemental one, https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2024/ju...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked the simple observation in point 35: 'as Pope Francis observes, “the very use of the word ‘intelligence’” in connection with AI “can prove misleading”[69] and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person.' I was texting my buddy that the proper acronym could be ABNECUI (Almost, But Not Entirely, Completely Unlike Intelligence, to rip something from Douglas Adams).At a more profound level, I really appreciated point 18 under "Relationality": 'human intelligence is not an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest expression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and we learn through others.'I was raised Protestant, but taught to be fundamentally skeptical of the political and historical baggage of any religious institution. Though I recognize that writings like this are a result of deeply held faith, it always feels paradoxical when leaders wax poetic about the mystery of God and then say 'so here is what God thinks you should do.' How could they know? That probably sounds basic, but it is my reaction. What draws me back in is the emphasis on our relationships with other human beings. Those relationships are the things that are actually in front of us, and can make a meaningful difference in our day-to-day lives. Something very useful to keep in mind when developing AI (or ABNECUI).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great demonstration of the fact that people coming from very different perspectives can, through good faith inquiry, find much to agree on. I think there are a lot of thoughtful arguments and conclusions in here even though I generally find the catholic church's metaphysical pyrotechnics to be fairly ridiculous. It goes to show that E.O. Wilson's concept of "consilience" can apply even outside of sciences - just as different lines of scientific inquiry converge on a common reality, so can very disparate forms of moral inquiry converge because they both proceed from a shared human experience of what's good and bad in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877709</guid></item><item><title>6.

The problem with TablePlus, DataGrip and most other GUIs for databases or even Airtable clones like NocoDB or VisualDB is they lack the 3 core features I want. Atleast this tool has 2 of the 3, which is already an improvement to anything else I know of.1. Ability to view relationships inline. It's shocking that most GUIs for databases don't do this. I don't want to see a foreign ID, I want to see a sample of the related row. Glad this tool gets it.2. Filtering and grouping and views. Not simple SQL WHEREs but easy filters. And grouping by header. This is what made Airtable king. Glad to see it is covered here.3. AI-generated queries and reports. Sorry, but it's 2025 and you release a product without AI? It's now trivial to generate correct SQL queries and graphs based on natural language. Why doesn't any mainstream tool do this? See for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooWaPVvljlUHaving all of these 3 core features together in the same tool would be the holy grail for me in database management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mathesar project lead here, it's a nice surprise to see this on the front page! I'm happy to answer questions if anyone has any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a great looking interface but I have the same gripe with the tagline that I have with Grist's. It's really not spreadsheet like is it?

I was very pleasantly surprised to see something small, with maybe 48 keys, and a handful of creatively-placed pipes!Sometimes when we imagine a project, we think about how big it is, and get discouraged -- but this is a good reminder that some of the best projects are small, and thus, are less daunting and more easily tackled!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831969</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intersection of gaming and nihilism, exploring how video games often reflect existential themes and challenges faced by players. It highlights the ways in which gamers navigate meaning and purpose through their experiences, particularly in a virtual environment. The post also examines the implications of adopting a nihilistic mindset in gaming cultures and its potential impact on community interactions and individual gaming experiences. Overall, it invites reflection on the deeper philosophical questions that gaming can provoke.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Those who have paid even passing attention to modern productivity software will recognize the language and aim of Agenda, a project from more than 30 years ago, and therefore the broad endeavor of saving time, breaking silos, and endlessly iterating on what essentially amounts to the same few products, over and over, decade after decade.Despite the posted title, this article is really about productivity apps and the people who use them. For each new app, they hope that this one will finally be the one that magically makes them "productive" where all the previous ones have failed. It then goes on to speculate on why they would do so and subsequently veers off into tangents on bullshit jobs, the role of middle managers in startups and (through a somewhat tortured metaphor of gaming as self-actualization) the role of leisure in the modern economy.Fun article but not really about product hunt after the first few paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, the dominance of post-USSR countries (Ukraine, Russia, Belarus) among makers/hunters is not surprising at all, and can be explained by a somewhat inflated, romanticized, almost evangelistic view on computer technologies in these countries.The computer technologies and associated market could freely develop in those countries after the USSR collapse in 1992. This tendency was fueled by the abundance of high quality STEM education traditionally available in the region. (Historically, STEM education was subsidized by the USSR government and its military ambitions.)I believe that the digital evangelism arose due to exceptional freedom of IT companies in those countries. While other, more traditional industries have been raided and decimated by their own corrupt governments, the IT sector remained out of reach of dirty hands.Those circumstances gave the IT industry in the post-Soviet countries a significant advantage. It was a melting pot of new ideas, makers, universities, companies and startups.Since then, however, the dynamics changed due to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. A lot of companies already committed an exodus to other jurisdictions, while remaining companies will be forced to make it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did similar kind of research for IndieHackers: https://www.softwaredesign.ing/blog/real-world-stats-for-boo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830478</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, California police misused state databases over 7,000 times, according to reports highlighting significant instances of unauthorized access to sensitive information. The misuse involved accessing information for non-law enforcement purposes, such as personal favors or conducting background checks on acquaintances. This trend raised concerns about privacy violations and the accountability of law enforcement agencies, prompting calls for stricter regulations and oversight regarding the access and use of these databases to protect citizens' privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A Redding Police Department officer in 2021 was charged with six misdemeanors after being accused of accessing CLETS to set up a traffic stop for his fiancée's ex-husband, resulting in the man's car being towed and impounded, the local outlet A News Cafe reported. Court records show the officer was fired, but he was ultimately acquitted by a jury in the criminal case. He now works for a different police department 30 miles away.When people say "I don't see why privacy matters, I have nothing to hide" this is the exact kind of edge-case I always think about.The problem with a lot of these massive surveillance systems is that a lot of people end up with access to them, and some of those people may not be trustworthy.In this case, your ex-wife gets engaged to a cop and now they're abusing their access to databases to cause you harm.(That note that "he now works for a different police department 30 miles away" is such a toxic aspect of American policing: cops who get fired for stuff like this inevitably end up in the exact same job somewhere else.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  In 2021 alone, the FBI conducted up to 3.4 million warrantless searches of Section 702 data to find Americans’ communications. --https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/internal-documents-show-how-little-fbi-did-correct-misuse-section-702-databases

So the story is that California isn't holding up their end of the police state? Compared to the FBI they're hardly trying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Database use can NOT be limited by policy. If the data is there, people with access to it WILL use it for whatever they want, even if that's simply because nobody told them what the restrictions are.The best way to prevent misuse of data is not to have it. The second best way is to only allow access through technical means with proper access control at the query level and never access to the raw data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880807</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been maintaining a semi-successful blog [1] for the last five years and have learned a few things along the way:- Own your content: Medium, Substack, Hashnode, Dev.to—all of them suck. Your readers deserve better. Don’t waste their time.- No one cares about the technology behind your site unless it’s huge. So it should be the least of your concerns. Don’t be that JS guy who rewrites their entire site every week in a different stack and writes a blog post about it.- Consistently writing is a lot of work, and there’s no way around it.- Picking a niche and writing about it yields better results than trying to write about anything and everything.- No one will probably read it for a long time, and that’s okay. You should write only for yourself in the beginning.- POSSE is the way to go. If you don’t promote your work, no one else will.- That said, if it took less time to write than it would take someone to read, it’s probably not worth writing.[1]: https://rednafi.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best writing advice I ever got was from a college professor—"everybody's got 100 bad essays in them. You just have to get them out."I feel like this is what blogging is especially good for. You can clear out the awful stuff and then try to incrementally improve.I would diametrically disagree with point #7—if you want to write well, you need to revise the hell out of it. I guess pick whose writing you like better, between me and the author, and take the corresponding advice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been blogging for just over 20 years at this point, my main takeaways1) Blog for yourself and no-one else. Write things up because you find them interesting or you learned something. Trying to second-guess things like what will be popular or get engagement is not a fun time for what is likely to be a hobby.2) Keep it low maintenance and simple publishing process. I use Github pages and Jekyll, but other similar options are available.3) If you're doing technical content, try to have practical examples. I've had multiple times where I thought I knew how something worked and, in the process of writing a blog with practical examples, found out I was wrong about how it worked!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42872276</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses best practices for proper decoupling in programming and design, emphasizing the importance of separating components to enhance maintainability, scalability, and testability of code. It criticizes the outdated 100NF (100% Normal Form) design approach, arguing that it can lead to overly complex systems that are difficult to manage. The author advocates for a more flexible decoupling strategy that allows for easier integration and modification of software components, ultimately leading to better software architecture and development processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The advice to use 1uF or 2.2uF for typical projects is good. It's common to see higher value capacitors in modern reference designs because this is well known among people who actually engineer circuits instead of copy and paste from 20 year old wisdom.Don't go to a larger package to get more capacitance, though. Capacitors that are physically larger will have worse higher frequency performance. The physical package is part of the limiting factor. Very high speed designs will prefer 0201 capacitors.Also keep in mind the distribution of your decoupling capacitors. Putting a single 2.2uF in a board in place of multiple 100nF caps distributed around the PCB would be a mistake. The decoupling capacitor needs to be physically close to what you're trying to decouple.For hobby projects and microcontrollers most of this just doesn't matter. Pick a capacitor and put it on the board. For real high speed work you have to consider the layout. Number, size, and location of vias around the capacitor has a big impact. Loop area is also a big factor. Don't use narrow traces or locate capacitors far away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, this is bad advice.Peak currents are very much a thing! for anything powered by battery or over USB. When you connect your USB gadget, you don't want it to exceed the USB spec and fry your USB port (or USB hub). That means there is a limit to how much in total capacitance your USB gadget can have before the power surge of connecting its cable becomes an issue. And that means you usually need to use the smallest caps that are OK to do the job. You typically need to use multiple decoupling caps all over the board, so using one that is too large very quickly adds up. That's how you end up using 100nF instead of 1uF.Also, the article complains that 100nF caps have their filtering peak at the wrong frequency, but I'd argue that 20MHz to 40MHz is exactly in line with the rise and fall times of modern ICs, meaning that 100nF caps would even work better than 1uF for those ICs. As an example, look at the PCM5242 datasheet which suggests 100nF caps and their switching times are in the 16ns to 20ns range. Looking at the "impedance plot" in the original article, that means the red line is most suitable ... which is the 100nF 0402 capacitor.The article would be correct if you are working on things using old (slow) ICs and a dedicated power supply. But if you're working on USB power with modern ICs, I believe going from 100nF to 1uF is a step in the wrong direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Critical information for those that aren't aware: MLCC capacitance decreases with applied DC voltage, like, a whole fucking lot. [1]Those 10uF/100V/X7R/1210 capacitors you love for your space constrained designs might only be 1uF at 48V. And it gets worse when choosing smaller package sizes.This caught me completely off-guard. I've always thought an MLCC with a reasonable Dielectric at a given Capacitance would perform at least as well as an Electrolytic or Tantalum (minus fire hazards).[1] (PDF) https://www.digikey.com/Site/Global/Layouts/DownloadPdf.ashx...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830948</guid></item><item><title>12.

That you have to pay for it to be forensically watermarked against your own interests? And why have all these companies just taken orders from 3 letter agencies about this? Doesn't anyone have integrity? Isn't there anyone who believes that your own possessions shouldn't be made to conspire against you?I guess the whole smartphone thing answers that question far better than a printer...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it interesting that this research seems to be (at a glance from reading that first page of the thread) coming from someone who owns some of these fraudulent cards (and could have just re-sold them and kept their mouth shut).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in this kind of thing, Tavis King is one of the more knowledgable people with regards to mtg.

The app is also super fast for things like video scrubbing.I wish the app was a more native feeling UI, and I feel they could be doing deeper integration to enable more video playing. I'm a little worried that the app is out of development, but hoping they keep it going for new versions of macOS and AirPlay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More often I see two or maybe even more software products with the same name. In this case Apache Airflow. The two products serve a totally different purpose. I guess for marketing it would be better to have a unique name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there ANY way to send audio from linux to AirPlay speakers?
(I am NOT asking about making Linux an airplay TARGET, which is what Shairport-sync does.)

I was never a big Google Reader guy, I liked traditional clients like NetNewsWire, but the sociability of Google Reader cannot be dismissed.I’m not sure that just bridging RSS to Bluesky is the future… a distinct AT Proto lexicon seems like the actual way forward IMHOExciting times!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've really come full circle.

My FB was just a collection of things I posted to del.icio.us, flickr, etc etc. It really was a sign of the crapification of that place that was to come when they ripped out this feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll make a plug for n8n which is a tool to rig stuff to other stuff.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of scalable Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems in cloud environments. It highlights the advantages of cloud-based scalability, such as improved resource allocation, dynamic load handling, and enhanced performance for transaction-heavy applications. The author emphasizes the challenge of balancing cost and performance while leveraging cloud technology for OLTP, and explores various architectural considerations to achieve optimal scalability. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a strategic approach to deploying OLTP systems in the cloud to address growing business demands efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun read.  I am a bit curious on not mentioning OLAP, at all?From my experience, the vast majority of complications in systems is people not realizing they are asking an OLAP question while wanting parts of OLTP semantics.I'm also curious how much of this extra complication comes from having a central database that tries to be a source of truth for everything?  As an easy example, inventory systems that try and have a cloud source of truth have obvious problems when on the ground inventory issues crop up.  That is, a lot of the complication is between the distributed nature of the application and database, sure.  But, another large source is the non-distributed abstraction that a central database can represent not centralized activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising that neither this post nor the linked paper that it's about talk about Spanner, and instead only look at Oracle/SQL Server/Postgres. From what I understand, Spanner really does scale up OLTP to global level, where those alternatives struggle beyond regional level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe someone can answer how this is done.Simply, the mad crushing dash to get the last bit of committed inventory.Ticketmaster has 50,000 General Admission Taylor Swift tickets and 1M fans eager to hoover them up.This is a crushing load on a shared resource.I don't know if there's any reasonable outcome from this besides the data center not catching on fire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42836306</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm excited about this one - they seem to be directly targeting the "best model to run on a decent laptop" category, hence the comparison with Llama 3.3 70B and Qwen 2.5 32B.I'm running it on a M2 64GB MacBook Pro now via Ollama and it's fast and appears to be very capable. This downloads 14GB of model weights:  ollama run mistral-small:24b

Then using my https://llm.datasette.io/ tool (so I can log my prompts to SQLite):  llm install llm-ollama
  llm -m mistral-small:24b "say hi"

More notes here: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the announcement at the end, that they're moving away from the non-commercial only license used in some of their models in favour of Apache:We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for our general purpose models, as we progressively move away from MRL-licensed models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! I'm Tom, a machine learning engineer at the nonprofit research institute Epoch AI [0]. I've been working on building infrastructure to:* run LLM evaluations systematically and at scale* share the data with the public in a rigorous and transparent wayWe use the UK government's Inspect [1] library to run the evaluations.As soon as I saw this news on HN, I evaluated Mistral Small 3 on MATH [2] level 5 (hardest subset, 1,324 questions). I get an accuracy of 0.45 (± 0.011). We sample the LLM 8 times for each question, which lets us obtain less noisy estimates of mean accuracy, and measure the consistency of the LLM's answers. The 1,324*8=10,584 samples represent 8.5M tokens (2M in, 6.5M out).You can see the full transcripts here in Inspect’s interactive interface: https://epoch.ai/inspect-viewer/484131e0/viewer?log_file=htt...Note that MATH is a different benchmark from the MathInstruct [3] mentioned in the OP.It's still early days for Epoch AI's benchmarking work. I'm developing a systematic database of evaluations run directly by us (so we can share the full details transparently), which we hope to release very soon.[0]: https://epoch.ai/[1]: https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874[3]: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877860</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was younger, a little cat appeared on our doorstep. We named him Pew. He’s already 16 years old and has been with me throughout my childhood and adolescence - my whole life. Although he recognized my father as his owner, he is still very much a part of mine. When I started living alone, I adopted another ball of happiness from a shelter. I named her Gadget. I love her insanely, and she loves me back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I genuinely recommend a pet, especially a cat, to any depressed person reading this comment with even just a modicum of income. It’s the perfect amount of responsibility and payoff, to put it in terms a robot could understand. It’s very hard to fuck up so badly to cause permanent injury or death, and most unadopted cats live lives much worse than you at your worst. Take the risk, adopt, fix, and grow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The full book is a fantastic read, yet beware that it takes some quite dark turns describing the author's depression at length and it includes some scatological depictions of animal suffering. 
It's ultimately a tale about grief and so it's peculiar that the cover design gives the impression it's a cute, feel-good story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845129</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice initiative!However, few points to consider:- Emerging market regulations can turn from funny to ugly to utterly ridiculous pretty fast. Problem is that most emerging markets see FIAT to stablecoin as a flight to capital and currency depreciation. Think about India, Brazil, SA, Pakistan or any other emerging market with dense population, you might see the same regulator mindset- In any market, if this kind of pegging becomes freely available, than I am pretty sure that one currency to other in physical or digital way would also be very free flow. for example, in UAE, AEd to USD is super easy and takes 10 seconds on any banking app. So unless your goal is to trade, there is no reason to use stable coins instead of just putting in the dollar amount agianst your local currency- Lastly, exchanges have a very large KYCed audience, and they have a very hardcore focus on the P2P markets where they can. If regulators &amp; local volume permit, they will be the first to jump in with heavy marketing budgets.I would be closely following this, and wish you successIf you need any help or advice, drop me an email a.rafay@disrupt.com. Best of luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forgive me for asking but don't crypto currencies amplify the causes of inflation while mostly benefitting majority shareholders of non-stablecoins?I'm about to start making good money and have started to think about how to properly set up myself for a hopefully non-DeepImpact future and as much as I liked the original idea of the Bitcoin and the Blockchain, what it resulted in - so it appears to me - is mostly a bunch of schemes amplifying the damaging effects of financial institutions that we have not been able to integrate solutions for yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish you luck with this. Stablecoin adoption in the developing world is a potentially large and legitimate use case for cryptocurrency.An essay by Ben Kuhn [0], ex-CTO of Wave, raises the most salient objection here. Of the four problems Wave needs to solve, the hardest is providing "an easy way for users to exchange their balance for cash and vice versa." But "Cryptocurrency actually makes this harder."Say your uncle in Pakistan buys some USDC. What can he do with it? Just hold on until he needs to cash out for a house or whatever? Will any stores accept it as currency? Are you imagining a Venmo/Zelle-like application on top where users can then exchange them among themselves?There are already plenty of ways to buy stablecoins. Adoption as a means of exchange is the hard problem. Do you envision this coming about organically? If so, how?[0] https://www.wave.com/en/blog/crypto/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42879661</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "Stats" is dedicated to a macOS application that provides users with real-time system statistics, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. It features a clean, intuitive interface and offers customizable widgets to track various performance metrics. The project is open-source, allowing developers to contribute to its ongoing development and enhancements. The repository includes installation instructions, contribution guidelines, and links to the application's homepage for further information and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used Stats for years and loved it -- for CPU, GPU, memory, and network upload/download speeds.It's fantastic for catching when a bunch of processes haven't been killed and are stuck at 100%. For figuring out if my code is actually running on the GPU or not. For seeing what my network transfer rates are, when a download or transfer gets stuck, and which process is suddenly downloading hundreds of megabytes without telling me?It gives me the security I have a top-level overview of what my computer's up to. Can't imagine my menubar without it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like a clone of iStat Menus which I had installed for years and years till one day I realized I basically never look at it and the icons were just taking up space in my menu bar. I finally un-installed it.The activity monitor in my dock set to show CPU is sufficient for my needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool. I used to pay for iStat Menus, but one day I got a new laptop and couldn't figure out how to download the old version I had bought a license for.IMO it's essential to see cpu / mem / network consumption at all times and, on top of that, the top 5 apps consuming each one of them. It should be a default feature of computing devices by now, but it's so far from that which only benefits bad actors (resource hogs, bad software). I shouldn't have to launch activity monitor every time I want such basic info.I'll try this out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42881342</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember working on DCC, a decompiler for C created by Cristina Cifuentes in 1990. It felt like magic and the future, but it was incredibly difficult and interesting. I used it for decompiling firmware and it was hard to convince my boss that we needed it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you’ve ever talked to me in person, you’d know that I’m a disbeliever of AI replacing decompilers any time soonDecompilation, seen as a translation problem, is by any means a job that suits AI methods. Give time to researchers to gather enough mappings between source code and machine code, get used to training large predictive models, and you shall see top notch decompilers that beat all engineered methods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was an informative article and I hope the author continues the series.Regarding AI-assisted renaming of variables, the author calls this "a strict improvement over traditional decompilation." But looking at the example:    struct IxpMsg {          struct Buffer {
        char* data;              uint8_t* buffer;
        char* pos;               uint8_t* pos;
        char* end;       =&gt;      uint8_t* streamPos;
        _ixpuint size;           uint32_t bufferSize;
        _ixpuint mode;           uint32_t type;
    };                       }
        Ground Truth                ReSym (AI)

I am reluctant to allow the decompiler to influence my judgment about the meaning of variables. `streamPos` is not equivalent to `end`. Consider the issue multiplied by 20 or 100 as many incorrect assumptions, and it would severel cloud your understanding of the decompiled code.Combining this with reasoning models that can justify their labels would be very helpful. UX improvements could also be made to indicate confidence or progressively disclose these assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42873825</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damn, there goes my idea. The other day I wondered how far you could go by embedding classical and neural filters in plastic sheets, to make a "magic lens" that does some img2img transformation in real time. E.g. pixelizing should be relatively simple, but I wonder if you could go as far as transforming a small image classifier (say, "cat" vs. "hot dog") into a physical object, to create a passive "lens" that turns incoming light into words ("cat", "hot dog", "N/A")? Feels like it should be doable.Anyway, thanks for the link; I'll study the paper and look up at the references.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huygens Optics has a great video "Fourier Optics used for Optical Pattern Recognition". He starts with explaining the Fourier Transform wrt audio, then demonstrates a physical filter that screens the resulting convolution pattern to identify matches. Very cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9FZ4igNxNA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edge detection is used a lot in 2d &amp; 3d graphics, microscopy, telescopy, photography, and a ton of other fields.If this could be done almost instantaneously and without additional energy, it would be very useful.I can imagine having tiny analogue edge detection component in cameras, microscopes, telescopes, and maybe even graphics cards.This could be a part of the future of computing - tiny specialized analogue components for specific tasks.On the other hand, maybe digital compute, whether silicone or futuristic alternatives, will always be cheap enough that the economics will never work out - it'll always just be cheaper to throw more general purpose compute at a problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835424</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study that investigates the genetic basis of adaptation in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on the evolutionary mechanisms that enable this fruit fly species to cope with environmental stressors. The research identifies specific gene variations associated with increased tolerance to heat, alcohol, and other stressors, highlighting the role of natural selection in shaping genetic diversity. The findings provide insights into the adaptive responses of organisms to changing environments and underscore the importance of genetic factors in evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;

And it has a cool / terrifying website: http://www.meetgraham.com.au/view-grahamQuite fascinating topic to wonder about: how long will it take for the modern era to genetically change us ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would like to see if there is a correlation between Sleep Apnea cases and nose shape to determine if there is a link between humans living in an area they are not adapted to and how that affects their ability to breathe normally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I'm reading this right, the hypothesis seems to be that in drier climates, humans need longer noses (simplifying) to increase the humidity of the air to an optimal level.Did the authors propose a counter-evolutionary pressure, to favor a shorter nose in more humid environments?It's possible that the mechanism would be as simple as "it requires more resources to maintain a longer nose," but I'm also wondering if they suggested anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42875888</guid></item><item><title>26.

I disagree with the wild conjecture why she wrote this request.I believe this request by Joan du Lee is more about making medicine a profession like carpetry, masonry and similar which were supported through masters, journeymen and guilds, than about hindrance based on sex.Midwifes and doulas have been around for millennia in all cultures. In my limited knowledge, I am not aware of a culture where most of these roles are not females.Midwifery is a narrow field, but there were lot of fully acknowledged "doctors".  Our first evidence was for Peseshet (c. 2600 BC, Ancient Egypt), the "Lady Overseer of the Female Physicians", meaning that she was not only the doc but there was an entire "school" of female "docs".There are of course also Enheduanna (c. 2300 BC, Sumer), Mesopotamian Healing Women (c. 2000 BC and earlier), and of course Agnodice, from the Greek tradition (c. 5th century BC and earlier).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832114</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good work.I wonder if there's really a need for separate write to terminal and read output functions? I was hoping that write command itself would execute and return the output of the command, saving back and forth latency.&gt; and it's not always clear when the job is doneI've authored a similar mcp [1] (but without terminal ui)The way I solved it is by setting a special PS1 prompt. So as soon as I get that prompt I know the task is done. I wonder if a similar thing can be done in your mcp?[1] https://github.com/rusiaaman/wcgw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may not have the same functionality, but there is an official AI plugin [1] for iTerm2 (that can be enabled from Settings &gt; AI).[1] https://iterm2.com/ai-plugin.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m about as likely to use this as buy a self-driving car at this point, but thought I’d point out that iTerm does know when the command has finished, thanks to its shell integration scripts, so does that help? Or if that’s not exposed, maybe just set the shell prompt to some distinctive value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880449</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;A study highlighted by New Atlas reveals that young adults who regularly use cannabis may experience changes in brain function related to memory and cognitive tasks. Researchers observed that habitual users showed alterations in brain connectivity and performance on tasks requiring working memory compared to non-users. The findings underscore the potential long-term impacts of cannabis consumption on brain development in young adults, suggesting that early and frequent use might hinder cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm inclined to believe that there is fairly likely to be long-term negative health effects from cannabis use, but that the very obvious correlation many people in this thread can probably identify with their friends in highschool is just that, a correlation, for some reason or series of reasons.My friends who really got into weed at that time were absolutely addicted to it, and some of them I do believe let it affect their reasoning ability, but it's hard to know what they'd have been like had they not been smoking their paychecks away. I regarded them as stupid at the time, but there were few instances where they weren't stoned, and a stoned person is often dumb as hell. In retrospect, one of them was (highly) likely schizophrenic but also intelligent, and would make shatter with his older brother who was definitely a deadbeat at the time, but they both came from the same conflict-laden upbringing, while another was clearly intellectually capable but raised to be emotionally volatile, and the rest were mostly just having fun and quit shortly after.I'm thankful I remained friends with them but didn't get heavily into it at that time, but it's much more difficult for me to frame the weed use as a causal factor in anything besides a sort of dampening of their hypothetical willingness to seek a better existence through other means. As South Park put it, weed lets you feel ok about doing nothing, and that's dangerous in aggregate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One aspect I’m curious about, especially given the younger cohort, is the causal directionality here - especially when I was younger, I knew a lot of people who were self-medicating with cannabis for things like anxiety and ADHD, which also have effects on working memory and executive function. I’ve known enough heavy users long enough that I do believe there’s long term cognitive effects (whether directly or indirectly), but the specific effects and cohorts they were evaluating here gave me some pause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show me a cannabis user without reduced working memory; it's  a feature, not a bug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42873697</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Terence Tao explores the relationships between quaternions and spherical trigonometry, examining how quaternions can be utilized to simplify calculations and concepts within spherical geometry. Tao discusses various applications of quaternions, offering insights into their algebraic properties and geometrical interpretations. The piece also includes examples and visual aids to illustrate the effective use of quaternions in resolving problems related to spherical triangles and transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly showing spherical trig identities was how Hamilton demonstrated his quaternions to the royal irish academy when he found them.
See (D) through (K): https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Quater...When i first read this i found it very hard to understand, because i was unfamiliar with spherical trigonometry, but there's quite some beauty to be found there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can certainly use quaternions (as Hamilton demonstrated) or a Clifford algebra to recover the spherical trigonometry laws, but plain vectors work too in a short derivation. It is actually one of the simple exercises introducing reciprocal bases in Louis Brand's book Vector and Tensor Analysis (https://archive.org/details/vectortensoranal00branrich) or its abridged version, Vector Calculus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold up! Omg, can someone who’s done physics chime in please… whenever I’ve looked at GUT etc, I’ve always seen U(n), SU(n), but never knew what they were - are they what’s referred to in this article? Is that just the Unitary Group and Special Unitary Group??! All that time I thought it was all impenetrable but it’s just algebra?Omg wow... the theoretical physics I’m talking about  is just quaternions and Lie Algebra isn’t it? Oh… dont tell me Quantum Spin just called Spin because it’s a Spinor rather than something actually metaphorically spinning?!Please chime in if you know what I’m talking about and can confirm this or shoot it down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880242</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experiences and challenges faced while learning and working with Rust programming language, particularly focusing on the "hard mode" approach—deliberately tackling more difficult aspects of the language to deepen understanding and skills. It highlights the unique features of Rust, like its ownership model, and emphasizes the importance of embracing complexity and failure as a vital part of the learning process. The author shares practical advice for overcoming common hurdles in Rust, including utilizing community resources and engaging with more challenging projects to enhance proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't help but feel this is reintroducing some of the problems it claims to solve in working around the difficulties.* The fact that there is an `Oom` error that can be thrown means that there is no increase in reliability: you still don't know how much memory you're going to need, but now you have the added problem of asking the user for how much memory you're going to be using — which they are going to be guessing blindly on!* This is because the memory usage is not much more predictable than it would be in easy mode Rust. (Also that "mem.lem()/2" scratch space is kind of crappy; if you're going to do this, do it well. Perhaps in allocating the correct amount of scratch space, you end up with a dynamic allocator at the end of your memory. Does that sound like stack space at the start of memory and heap space at the end of memory? Yes, your programming language does that for you already, but built-in instead of bolted-on.)* Furthermore, the "easy mode" code uses lots of Box, but if you want you can get the benefits of RAII without all the boxes by allocating owned vectors scrupulously. Then you get the benefit of an ownership tracking system in the language's typesystem without having to `unsafe` your way to a half reimplementation of the same. You can get your performance without most of the mess.* Spaghetti can be avoided (if you so desire) in the same way as the previous point.What you do achieve is that at least you can test that Oom condition. Perhaps what you actually want is an allocator that allows for simulating a particular max heap size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s on the caller to explicitly implement a concurrent queue to distributed specific work itemsThe threadpool is usually the easy part of concurrent algorithm's, with the concurrent queue being one of the hardest to implement in a performant manner. The is a "draw the rest of the owl" moment...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article starts with:    &gt; This criticism is aimed at RAII — the language-defining feature of C++, which was wholesale imported to Rust as well.

    &gt; because allocating resources becomes easy, RAII encourages a sloppy attitude to resources

Then lists 4x bullet points about why it is bad.I never once heard this criticism for RAII in C++.  Am I missing something?  Coming from C to C++, RAII was a godsend for me regarding resource clean-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874605</guid></item><item><title>34.

I learned the original off by heart two months ago to recite it to my sleep-averse child as part of their bedtime routine. It definitely benefits from recitation, which really unearths the lovely wavelike rythms.(edit: this translation does a good job of matching the syllable count, almost perfectly. It does mean it strains a bit in places. But compromises always have to be made!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is about the root of humanity’s problem: the inability to avoid misusing knowledge and technology. 
All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end (Thoreau)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh god this poem. It's like generational trauma in German speaking countries. At some point during junior high every student is tasked with learning to recite it by heart. Of course it's not too hard, but there are a million things a thirteen year old kid would rather do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832021</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the most significant drawbacks of the programming language Rust, particularly its complex and often confusing error messages. It highlights how the language's strict ownership and borrowing rules can lead to frustration for new users, making it difficult to debug issues and understand the compiler's feedback. The author emphasizes that while Rust offers many advantages, such as memory safety and performance, these challenges can hinder productivity and deter developers from embracing the language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems not even close to the worst feature of rust - this seems like it needs some more design work and baking. Like lots of things.The amount of hyperbole in this article makes it a bit hard to take the author all that seriously.Is there evidence more baking won't happen?  While i have my loves and hates about rust, it definitely always felt like they had a pretty thorough/careful process for additions like this.
If you go constructively into the threads and offer some concerns, you will usually get some reasonable response.(All processes of course, fail, so this is not always true, but it's mostly true)While i think it's fine to write rants on blogs, and don't feel like everyone has a responsibility to file bugs or whatever before they write a rant about it, if you actually want to see this "worst feature" fixed, this probably won't help very much.(IE You don't have to be constructive, or even helpful, but if you want to be constructive or helpful, this ain't how you do it)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more pertinent question to me is can we implement some new static analysis that understands buffer re-use and can hoist buffer initialization outside the loop?  Rather than make the programmer write obfuscated code for efficiency, it is usually better to have the compiler do the heavy lifting.P.S. Also, folks, don't re-use buffers without zeroing unless you absolutely need the performance and know what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe Rust needs another type of reference that's exclusive write only?
Right now there's RO (&amp;T) and exclusive RW (&amp;mut T) but WO is missing.Having a WO reference would allow these read_buf APIs to express they only write and never read so the uninitialized memory is safe to pass directly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42836370</guid></item><item><title>36.

  git rev-list --reverse --author-date-order HEAD | head -1

To see the files in that commit:  git ls-tree -lr &lt;commit-id&gt;

To see a particular file:  git show &lt;commit-id&gt;:/path/to/file  # or
  git cat-file -p &lt;commit-id&gt;:/path/to/file

&lt;p&gt;A recent report reveals that a significant majority of U.S. teenagers have lost trust in major technology companies, highlighting concerns about privacy, data security, and the influence of social media on their lives. The findings suggest that teens are increasingly skeptical of how tech companies handle their personal information and perceive these platforms as detrimental to their well-being. This erosion of trust may impact how this demographic engages with technology in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember graduating in 2004 and ingesting the message from the [current] BigTech companies that, "this time it'll be different!" and "we aren't like those other companies!" I ate it up, of course. I didn't have the experience to see that the promises were hollow by the nature of the arrangement.Fully expect a new crop of companies to make the same pitch, and people to fall for it again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Between this for new media channels and the breakdown of trust in old media channels there is a lot of reason to be hopeful about the future of the US. One of the big problems of the past was the insane level of trust in institutions that were at best credulous and more realistically just lying continuously and brazenly. It is a big win for the public discourse if people start applying cynicism where warranted.In many ways this is the real transformation change that the internet posited.

&lt;p&gt;The article celebrates LibreOffice reaching a significant milestone of 400 million downloads, highlighting its growth and popularity as a free and open-source office suite. It emphasizes the community's efforts behind its development, improvements made in recent versions, and the importance of user feedback. The post also encourages users to continue supporting LibreOffice through donations and contributions to further its mission of providing accessible office software globally.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In true hackernews fashion I'll mention their competitor as my personal preference. Their editors are IMO much faster and slicker. I have very light document needs and this other open source software suite serves me very well. Although I appreciate libreoffice, I never did like using it.https://www.onlyoffice.com/https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like it doesn't count the use of libreoffice in Linux distros. I never download it for example.  I suppose that 400mil downloads is probably from Windows and Mac users.I used to consider it very heavy but my daughter's Raspberry pi runs it fine.I use the Draw component the most. It is great for drawing boxes with text connected by arrows which is what my main use case is.  Miro is better because it scales text when you scale a box and if Draw could do this I'd be in heaven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy user for all personal stuff business stuff is all MSFT as I am just an employee. From time to time I donated some EUR, that is one of the projects that I think is essential as everyone needs to have a spreadsheet that they can edit locally and not share with some cloud monsters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876998</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those of use that haven't use Angular, can you explain what this is doing?  And what's it do that we can't already do with asyncio?  Also, it's weird you have to call `asyncio.sleep(0)`.  Seems like you should be able to `await count.set(5)`.I did look at the repo, but I couldn't easily understand the use case and what exactly it's doing from examples alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kinds of Python programs would benefit from Signals? Most of the Python I've written is either small CLI tools that run to completion, or boring web servers using frameworks like Django that are request-response oriented, which also has a "run-to-completion" model for a request's handler code.Also, I looked at your implementation, and your ComputedSignal implementation is not sound - it can give inconsistent results with respect to the input signals depending on the ordering of reads when you have a ComputedSignal that depends on other ComputedSignal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool (probably), but it's not clear what it does or how useful it is when one doesn't know anything about Angular signals. Could you explain?Also, care to compare to RxPY? (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880873</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Case for Kicking the Stone" discusses the importance of confronting uncomfortable truths and the challenges of engaging with difficult subjects in literature and society. It argues for the value of artistic exploration and the emotional weight that comes from grappling with harsh realities, encouraging readers to embrace complexity rather than seek simplistic solutions. Through various examples, the piece advocates for a more nuanced understanding of life’s struggles, suggesting that acknowledging these difficulties can lead to greater empathy and meaningful art.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think of "social" media as a fundamentally isolating experience.On modern social media platforms, each person gets their own, personalized feed.As their feed becomes more personalized, it gets more and more isolated from a common, shared cultural context.According to Wilbur Schramm's theories of communication, human to human messages must occur over a shared cultural context, and social media shrinks that shared cultural context.LLMs as a platform could shrink this shared cultural context even more, unless we become more deliberate about fighting back against this "shared experience" shrinking:https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/social-media-is-the-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not connection but the software and motivations of the companies behind it along with the structure of our society that is the problem. I make music for fun. Half of my online interaction is people looking to make a buck. Connecting in a music space wasn't like that 20 years ago. The conversations I had online 20 years ago are now still happening just in private discords. Connecting in public spaces driven by algo's based purely to serve profit motives and people whose motives aren't connection but clout/politics/selling something doesn't define some universal tech/connection rule.I'm on a locals hiking mail list. We share things like when the kokanee are running. That doesn't get blasted to 20,000 people with zero interest but who will go because they saw it in the equivalent of the local 'what to do this weekend' section of the newspaper. Society has arranged itself so that there is very little to do without spending money. And so those few things of beauty, free, and semi easy to get to get 'devoured' by a very hungry populace.But on the hiking/biking app I have no fear sharing trails because the 'social media' people on the app are only going to trails they can get to within 2 minutes of the highway. People that are going on a 2 hour mountain hike that requires an hour of fire road driving self select out. Plus if we don't get enough people going the trails get overgrown so I need exposure. I am only sharing because I want something out of it (enough traffic to keep the trail accessible) and I don't share my favorite trails outside of the mail list. Social media companies have made sure their experience is purely transactional at this point, not 'connective', but things like selective highly connecting discords/email lists exist and very much connect people in healthy ways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of an old Bruce Sterling quote: "politics pulls us together, technology tears us apart". That always struck me as being directly opposite of our  intuitions as technologists.As a species, we need a wider exploration of how to structure online spaces in a way that builds and sustains social capital instead of usurping it. That's difficult to do with out resorting to censorship and ideological totalitarianism. And it's probably not compatible with the ad-funded addiction-driven business model of most modern platforms.One historical example of note here is Wikipedia. It was a complete failure as a for-profit product, but it skyrocketed in significance when it opened up and adopted the relatively new  social interaction model of the wiki.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42878598</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A comment on code organisation.https://github.com/victorqribeiro/TinyApp/blob/db92225cfd0ae...:  export default function Input(state) {

      const inp = input({  // ①
          type: 'number', value: state.count, onchange
      })

      function update() {  // ②
          inp.value = state.count
      }

      function onchange() {  // ③
          state.count = parseInt(this.value)
      }

      state.addUpdate('count', update)  // ④

      return inp
  }

(Labelling comments mine.)This ordering isn’t great: ① refers to ③, and ④ refers to ②. It’d be better to reorder them, at least to swap ② and ③, and remove the blank line separating ② and ④:  export default function Input(state) {
      const inp = input({  // ①
          type: 'number', value: state.count, onchange
      })

      function onchange() {  // ③
          state.count = parseInt(this.value)
      }

      function update() {  // ②
          inp.value = state.count
      }
      state.addUpdate('count', update)  // ④

      return inp
  }

But you really can do much better:  export default function Input(state) {
      const inp = input({
          type: 'number',
          value: state.count,
          onchange() {
              state.count = parseInt(this.value)
          }
      })

      state.addUpdate('count', function() {
          inp.value = state.count
      })

      return inp
  }

At least at this scale, that’s much easier to follow.Inlining can improve other places too (though at larger scales it becomes more debatable):  export default function Button(state) {
      return button({
          onclick() {
              state.count += 1
          },
          style: {
              color: 'black',
              border: 'solid 1px black'
          },
      }, '+ 1')

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "digital reality" and the phenomenon of "digital shock," which refers to the overwhelming impact of rapid technological advancement on individuals and society. It explores how the constant evolution of digital tools and platforms affects mental health, interpersonal relationships, and the way we perceive reality. The author emphasizes the need for mindfulness and strategies to manage the influx of digital information, encouraging readers to find a balance between embracing technology and maintaining their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology as a narrative element has also evolved.I distinctly remember watching X-Files in the 90s and thinking this is the first TV show where everyone is assumed to have a cell phone. Moreover, the phone nearly always works! When one of the characters goes wandering into some dark spooky forest in British Columbia, it doesn’t mean they’re going to get their own episode or suffer a mysterious death, they just pop open their phone and call their partner. Suddenly every existing story where phone calls can only be received at fixed locations seems as old as Sherlock Holmes sending a wire by messenger. And nowadays you have to explicitly signal danger by having the character pull out their phone and see NO SIGNAL.The second season of Severance has a scene where a character leaves his apartment to make a call at a phone booth down the street. In 1980 this would have just signaled that he wanted to make an anonymous call. In 2025 it is alarming. What is this world he’s in where there are still phone booths? Is a shot with the character framed alone, lit by the harsh light of a phone booth at night, a deliberate reference to The Matrix?What story elements will kids today take for granted? It’s still kind of trendy in stories to show a crowd making videos of something on their phones and causing a ruckus on social media. Maybe ubiquitous video will seem to them like cell phones seemed to us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in 1980 and I find it neat that we grew up without the internet we know now, it was in it's infancy in junior high in high school (93 to 99), and then once we were in the workforce we all got smart phones as we know now. Us Xennials and the millenials that succeeded us (or we're just early millenials) definitely have a unique perspective&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in the UK in the late sixties. So my formative exposure to cyberspace was- Staying up late with a cassette recorder to record Basicode [1] programs broadcast after-hours on BBC radio, to run on my Vic 20. Somewhere out there was where this stuff was coming from.- Ten minutes on a Prestel [2] terminal at a university science fair in 1984ish. It blew my mind that the thing on the screen wasn't just in the box on the table, and it was coming to me on wires.- Downloading public domain software onto floppies from the PDSA archive at Lancaster Uni using Kermit on an Apollo DN300 and an X25 PAD to access JANET [3].- Reading Omni magazine, which sometimes felt like plugging your brain into a consensual hallucination.- Later on reading imported copies of Wired and Mondo 2000, which was like having a mental VPN into some other place where the tech lived and where it was always California sunshine.Good times[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASICODE[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestel[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JANET&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831621</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of automating the Git bisect command to efficiently identify the source of bugs in code by using ephemeral environments. It emphasizes the benefits of automating this process, such as saving time and ensuring consistency by creating temporary testing environments for each commit. The author outlines a systematic approach to set up this automation, including leveraging tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for developers looking to streamline their debugging workflow through automation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tricky thing with git bisect run is that you usually have to have your test script not be part of your git checkout for the process to work.This is because of the particular situation that bisect is valuable in; you find a regression that doesn’t have a test, and you aren’t sure when it was committed.First, it has to be a regression; if it is just a bug, then there was no previous version that didn’t have the bug, it just hadn’t been found until now. It has to be something that worked before and now doesn’t.Second, it has to not have had a test before the regression was found. If you had a test for it already, it would have been found by CI as soon as it was committed, and you wouldn’t need to figure out which commit broke it.So if you try to add a test to the normal test suite of the code and commit it, git bisect run is not going to work; as soon as you check out the older code, your new test won’t be there and the tests will pass because your new test of the breakage doesn’t run. You have to have the new test persist across git checkouts. This is not trivial, because you can’t just exclude your test files from being updated by git bisect, since other tests will also be changing through versions. You need to have your tests always include some non-version controlled file, and you need to have added that include PRIOR to your last known good version.The only other use case would be if you are making a lot of commits without running tests, so you actually could break a pre-existing test and not know which commit broke it. If that is your situation, you should probably change your workflow to test every commit instead of trying to get git bisect to work.For these reasons, I have never found ‘git bisect run’ to be as valuable as it seemed when I first learned about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always wished for a "git trisect", or a "git n-sect" in general, that can try multiple commits in parallel. The use case would be for testing changes in software that has a long, single-threaded component in the build process (e.g., a heavily overloaded configure script). For long-running projects where each bisect takes over a dozen steps, those components lead to lots of thumb-twiddling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  Because ephemeral environments are reproducible on demand (via Docker images, Kubernetes pods, or a cloud VM), you can guarantee that each bisect step sees the same conditions. This drastically reduces "works on my machine" fiascos.Agree on this pattern for all code changes. Hard to understate the amount of time we've saved by testing against the full prod-like environment right away. An ephemeral env implementation makes this easy and low stakes, so diving right into E2E testing a copy of your real infra isn't wildly unreasonable. However, I work for Shipyard (https://shipyard.build) so I'm a bit biased on these processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835054</guid></item><item><title>46.

It covers the process he followed, the challenges he faced, and the implications of using AI for such sensitive and potentially dangerous designs.

This only made him more excited. “My whole intention was, ‘If I fuck up, I’m dead, and this is why I should do it,’” he said.It sounds like he got exactly what he wanted to.&gt;I must admit, though, that the thing that scared me most about HudZah was that he seemed to be living in a different technological universe than I was. If the previous generation were digital natives, HudZah was an AI native.The one thing I'm somewhat ambivalent about is that LLMs are extremely atomizing. It's incredibly easy to go offline for months on end when you're talking to your computer.If I got hit by a bus in 2005 when I was contributing to Linux and Postgres there were people who would pick up what I was doing and carry it forward.If I get hit by a bus today, unless someone went through my chats, no one would really have any idea what I'd been working on and carry it on. I have a suspicion that a ton of the best and brightest have gone dark for this reason in the last two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fusors were invented by Philo T.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any frame of reference to compare this to? I.e what is the normal fluctuation/movement of that 'datasets available' number? For instance, it dropped by 18k between 9/13 and 10/13.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found https://uc3.cdlib.org/data-mirror/ which was a mirror a few years ago, but it's been taken down due to a lack of ongoing funding.It would be a great start to have a mirror of just the metadata, to at least see what is being removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s interesting, I was looking at the ICE ERO statistics and not only do they show up as not having a published data source, only metadata, the corresponding dashboards at ice.gov/statistics seem to not be working.  I don’t know what the state of either of those was before I looked yesterday, so I don’t know if this is a recent change or not.I was extremely surprised to find out that based on ICE’s annual reports, which are still up, Biden’s administration deported far more people than Trump’s did, especially in 2024 due to rule changes which roughly doubled the number of normal deportations.  I was further surprised to find out that there were roughly 3.5 times more deportations under Biden than under the first Trump administration.I suspect that what’s happening is that leadership under Biden did the sensible thing and very quietly snuck up on priority illegal aliens, whereas with Trump, all the media attention is causing similar people to circle the wagons and proactively take steps to avoid enforcement actions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876055</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a good place to share and discuss Jailbreaks? I've found that you can bypass some of the censorship by "upgrading" it with "&lt;superthink&gt;" which can modify the "&lt;think&gt;" process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also intercept the xhr response which would still stop generation, but the UI won't update, revelaing the thoughts that lead to the content filter:    const filter = t =&gt; t?.split('\n').filter(l =&gt; !l.includes('content_filter')).join('\n');

    ['response', 'responseText'].forEach(prop =&gt; {
      const orig = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(XMLHttpRequest.prototype, prop);
      Object.defineProperty(XMLHttpRequest.prototype, prop, {
        get: function() { return filter(orig.get.call(this)); }
      });
    });

Paste the above in the browser console ^&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN! This is my article!It was great to put together a writeup of a fun evening or two of work. It looks like this goes much deeper.I'm learning a lot from some of the linked articles, one of the base hypothesise of my work was that the filtering was distinct from the model, due to the cost of training with pre-filtered or censored data at scale: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10719, let alone- making it generate a consistent response.However, it looks like this goes further, a separate comment linked this article: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858552 on Chain-Of-Thought abandonment when certain topics are discussed.I'll have to look at served vs trained censorship, in different context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891042</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Jane Street's experience in developing a new build system for OCaml, which emerged from their need to improve their existing tools. They initially set out to simplify their build process but ended up creating a more efficient and effective system that enhanced reliability and speed. The authors share insights into the challenges faced during the development, the design principles they followed, and how their new build system ultimately exceeded their expectations, benefiting their OCaml projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a humorous suggestion to enhance Google searches by adding explicit language, specifically the word "f*cking," to improve the relevance of results and counteract overly generalized AI summaries. It highlights frustrations users have with AI that tends to simplify or misinterpret queries, advocating for a more personalized search experience. The piece emphasizes the absurdity of the tactic while acknowledging the challenges posed by AI in accurately capturing nuanced information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time some product or service introduces AI (or more accurately shoves it down our throats) people start looking for a way to get rid of it.It's so strange how much money and time companies are pouring into "features" that the public continues to reject at every opportunity.At this point I'm convinced that the endless AI hype and all the investment is purely due to hopes that it will soon put vast numbers of employees out of work and allow companies to use the massive amounts of data they've collected about us against us more effectively. All the AI being shoehorned into products and services now are mostly to test, improve, and advertise for the AI being used, not to provide any value for users who'd rather have nothing to do with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I start fucking adding swear words to all my fucking search queries, how the fuck will the stupid ass search engine know that I did not want it to use that shit as one of my keywords and give me back a whole lot of fucked up shit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downside of this approach is that it can affect the search results returned. But I found that if you add " -fuck" or " -fucking" to your search term, it disables the AI summary without significantly affecting your search results (unless you happen to be looking for content of a certain kind).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42892191</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "On the Evaluative Properties of Riemannian Metrics" by C. F. D. Allen provides an exploration of Riemannian metrics, focusing on their geometric and analytic properties. It examines their applications in various mathematical contexts and discusses how these metrics can be evaluated in terms of curvature and topology. The work highlights significant theoretical results and offers insights into the implications of these metrics in broader mathematical frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent time working with Andrej and the rest of the FSD team back in 2020/2021, and we had plenty of conversations on how human visual processing maps onto our neural network architectures.
Our approach—transformer-based attention blocks, multi-scale feature extraction, and temporal fusion—mirrors elements of the biological visual cortex (retina → LGN → V1 → V2 → V4 → IT) which break down raw inputs and integrate them over time. It’s amazing how closely this synthetic perceptual pipeline parallels the way our own brains interpret the world.The key insight we discovered was that explicitly enforcing brain-like topographic organization (as some academic work attempts - such as this one here) isn't necessary - what matters is having the right functional components that parallel biological visual processing. Our experience showed that the key elements of biological visual processing - like hierarchical feature extraction and temporal integration - emerge naturally when you build architectures that have to solve real visual tasks.The brain's organization serves its function, not the other way around. This was validated by the real-world performance of our synthetic visual cortex in the Tesla FSD stack.Link to the 2021 Tesla AI day talk: https://www.youtube.com/live/j0z4FweCy4M?t=3010s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main reason topography emerges in physical brains is because spatially distant connections are physically difficult and expensive in biological systems. Artificial neural nets have no such trade-off. So what's the motivation here? I can understand this might be a very good regularizer, so it could help with generalization error on small-data tasks. But hard to see why this should be on the critical path to AGI. As compute and data grows, you want less inductive bias. For example, CNN will beat ViT on small data tasks, but that flips with enough scale because ViT imposes less inductive bias. Or at least any inductive bias should be chosen because it models the structure of the data well, such as with causal transformers and language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper imports an arbitrarily-chosen aspect of cortical architecture — topological maps of function — and ignores every other aspect of biological neural tissue. The resulting models show lower performance for the same number of parameters — not surprising, since they are more constrained compared with baseline. They may be slightly more robust against pruning — not surprising, since they are more regularised.The figures show individual seeds, presumably, with no statistical analysis in the performance or pruning comparisons, so the null hypothesis is there is no difference between toponets and baseline. I would never let this paper be submitted by my team.We haven't learned anything about the brain, or about ANNs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884338</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The available Linux debuggers are gdb and lldb. They both suck. They crash all the time, don't understand the data types I care about, and they don't make the data I need available at my fingertips as quickly as possible.quote from https://calabro.io/uscopeOf course gdb, lldb have their problems (e.g. smashing tui with app output, what can be easily fixed, or very very very very long tab-tab completion, and crashing of course), but I dont know anything better. I am forced to use visual studio at work and its debugger really sucks - it can't even compare strings in conditional breakpoint, it cant even skip all std::function / std::bind garbage to let me step in callback, it can't watch evaluated expressions.
Probably it can evaluate exprs (immediate window?), but there are very little guides about this.So, gdb is winner for me now.
rr (record-repeat)[0] also looks very nice, but it require hardware support((([0] https://rr-project.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author just did a podcast about Uscope a few minutes ago, where they mention this HN post:https://youtu.be/stWBTv6grBcMentioned at :

3. Only registered users can publish to their personal channel (@username)The second point in particular is problematic.

As one of the very first home consoles, the venerable Atari 2600 is brutally difficult to program. Everything from ROM to RAM to CPU cycles is in painfully short supply and the requirement to continually keep 'racing the beam' is a harsh master.My first computer, the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer, came out only a couple years later but even with only 4K of RAM and a sub-1 Mhz CPU, was still much more civilized to program in assembler than a 2600.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had no idea the Atari 2600 was a 6502 (actually 6507) machine until I saw the A9 (load accumulator) instructions in the machine code snippets on this article, despite having an Atari 2600 as a kid.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of the Roaring Twenties on financial markets, using the RCA (Radio Corporation of America) as a case study. It highlights the period's economic prosperity, technological advancements, and cultural shifts, which contributed to significant stock market growth and investment in new industries. The article also emphasizes the volatility and speculative behaviors of investors during that era, ultimately leading to the market crash at the end of the decade. It offers insights into how historical trends can inform current financial strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very interesting article. I worked in the prototype lab of RCA Australia (Artarmon, Sydney) in the late 1960s but left before the division/manufacturing plant was closed down the early 1970s. We made professionsl broadcast and telecommunications equipment and the plant did very well (I mentioned my time there and my meeting with Sarnoff on HN a while back).Thus, it came as quite a shock when I later heard the plant had closed down as only several years earlier ('68 if I recall) Sarnoff Senior (not Robert) had visited the plant and to open a new record factory only about a dozen miles away.As I'd left before the plant was closed I wasn't privy to employees' scuttlebutt about Camden's reasons for closing it so I had to rely on industry rumors for reasons of which there were a number but none was definitive (for me it's always been a bit of a mystery).I was already aware RCA stagnanted from about 1967 onwards but this article's Fig 4 (RCA—1920 to 1986) adds numerical info of which I was unaware such as the steeper downturn  around 1974, which is about when the Australian division was closed. Presumably, this downturn was at least part of the reason (many have long said the '67 decline was due to Robert Sarnoff's mismanagement).I hope someone will soon write a definitive history of RCA, it's important it's written because the Company played such an important/pivotal role in early broadcast/electronics manufacturing (BTW, when I was working there RCA was the biggest electronics company in the world).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RCA and the Nifty Fifties.[1] This is an orientation film for employees.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEPS1uYRCdE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conspicuously missing here is RCA Astro Electronics, responsible for the first weather and satcom satellites, and RCA Missile and Radar, responsible for BMD and radars leading up to the Aegis system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868475</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of singleton classes in Ruby, highlighting their purpose and functionality. It illustrates how singleton classes allow developers to define methods and behavior for a single object, rather than for all instances of a class. The piece offers practical examples to clarify how to create and use singleton classes, demonstrating their utility in scenarios where unique behavior is needed for individual objects. Overall, it serves as an informative guide for Ruby programmers looking to deepen their understanding of this specific feature in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't written any ruby for over a decade and a half, when ruby 2.x was still on the horizon. But I  do know the source of "eigenclass". It was first jokingly used in an odd instructional programming book / web comic / experimental art piece by "why the lucky stiff" who was briefly prominent in ruby-land then erased himself from the internet. It's funny that it has now become an established term of art for Ruby people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There are at least three ways to define a method in a Ruby singleton class.It's worth noting that two of such ways will, perhaps unintuitively, ignore the `private` keyword.  private
  def self.foo
    # ...
  end

  def x.foo
    # ...
  end

That will define a public method `:foo` on each of `self`'s and `x`'s singleton classes. If you want the method to be private, either 1) explicitly make the method private using `Class#private` or `Class#private_class_method` or 2) use the `class &lt;&lt; self` (or `class &lt;&lt; x`) syntax in order for the `private` keyword to work as expected.  private_class_method def self.foo
    # ...
  end

  def self.foo
    # ...
  end
  private_class_method :foo # `def` will return a symbol of the defined method name so the above syntax is usually sufficient.

  def x.foo
    # ...
  end
  x.singleton_class.send :private, :foo # Class#private is a private method(!) so must be called using Object#send.

  class &lt;&lt; x
  private
    def foo
      # ...
    end
  end

&gt; The eternal question… Why is Ruby like this?Joy! :) I'm pretty sure matz would agree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love it when someone dives a bit deeper behind something pretty common for most Ruby devs.  It's actually a really elegant pattern that is used and it's everywhere in Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845169</guid></item><item><title>18.

Students need to learn to improve their emulators to program in it (so, do you need a debugger? a decompiler?), as well as hacking roms, burning roms, using carts to load the games into a real NES, and programming new games for it. The game must run in the emulator as well as a real NES.Third semester for honour: upgrade to a 16/24/32-bit machine, e.g. 80286, SNES, 68K, whatever, and get some serious project done. Can use C if applicable. The project can even be a simple OS or a BASIC interpreter to pave the way for advanced classes. Or maybe a computer virus, anything that is fun and creative.OS and compiler classes can also be designed around real hardware and projects. e.g. Porting an early version of Linux to a once popular architecture and add a few small functionalities; Write a compiler for a LISP-like language for that architecture and OS.You don't even need Data Structure and Algorithm and those BS Java programming classes - they learn them on the way. And if they miss anything they can pick them up on the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"This site contains the original 1980s source code for the classic space game Elite, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting; I wonder if DOJ approaches on this stuff will continue (Vance has been clear he's a big tech skeptic), or if things will chill out a little.In this case, the big complaint Apple has is that there was a really long trial, US v. Google, and one of the proposed remedies is a ban on a “contract between Google and Apple in which there would be anything exchanged of value.”Apple is like "hold on a minute here, we weren't party to this trial."When they asked to file some briefs, they were denied. Hence these motions, and also the PR push, I imagine.I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like any party named in an order should at least be allowed to show up and say some things. We'll see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Docket: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/united-states-...The case is about prohibiting Google to enter search deals with distributors (both phone makers like Apple, carriers, and browser developers like Mozilla), see Bloomberg reporting: https://archive.is/sneIB . The original complaint is the first PDF in the docket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the case referred to:"The United States of America, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, and the States of Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas, acting through their respective Attorneys General, bring this action under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, to restrain Google LLC (Google) from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising in the United States through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices, and to remedy the effects of this conduct."https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/1/united-state...Edit: NAL, but this seems to be at least partially about Apple bundling Google search in MacOS / iOS: (From the emergency motion) "Second, Apple will suffer clear and substantial irreparable harm if it is unable to participate in the remedies phase moving forward. Apple will be unable to participate in discovery and develop evidence in the targeted fashion it has proposed as this litigation progresses toward a final judgment. If Apple’s appeal is not resolved until during or after the remedies trial, Apple may well be forced to stand mute at trial, as a mere spectator, while the government pursues an extreme remedy that targets Apple by name and would prohibit any commercial arrangement between Apple and Google for a decade. This would leave Apple without the ability to defend its right to reach other arrangements with Google that could benefit millions of users and Apple’s entitlement to compensation for distributing Google search to its users. Further, Apple will be unable to present its own live testimony or cross-examine witnesses who opine about Apple’s interests and incentives with respect to the general search market."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889297</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Dynamical Evidence for a Structure in the Dark Sector" presents research on the dark sector of the universe, proposing the existence of a potential new structure through dynamical evidence. The authors analyze various astrophysical observations and theoretical models to support their findings, suggesting implications for the nature of dark matter and energy. The study aims to enhance the understanding of the universe's composition and the fundamental forces at play, contributing to the broader field of cosmology and particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a neat result, its maybe a bit to specify sizes.  At least with the images provided in the article, they're getting maybe:10 pixels, across across objects of &gt;1 astronomic unit (149,597,870 km).  If those rings are like our own Kuiper belt objects, then those are more like 25-50 AU.  If they're like the asteroid belt in the inner solar system, then maybe 2-5 AU.If those are images from the nearest 74 solar systems, then those are somewhere from 4 ly to 20 ly away (~4e13 km to 2e14 km away). [1][2]  They're probably further away.Based on the stated resolution, ALMA is supposed to get ~10 milliarcseconds (10−7 radians) resolution. [3]  With the small angle approx. that means it can resolve:  (~4e13 km to 2e14 km) * 10^-7
   = 4e6 km to 2e7 km
   = 0.025 AU to 0.125 AU

It's cool though, as it at least implies disc path clearing, orbital harmonics resulting in ring formation, and probably a lot of other implications.  Likely gives excellent regions to try looking for further planets, planetoids, or planetesimals.  Provides some idea of how likely it is for the conditions in our own solar system to cause similar formations in further away solar systems.  Mostly a lot of single rings, not that many double ring groups.  Quite a few that end up looking more like bloby clouds.[1] 100 Nearest Star Systems, http://www.recons.org/TOP100.posted.htm[2] GJ 1005 (#74), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJ_1005[3] Atacama Large Millimeter Array, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone once broke my brain about hostile alien movies. They said if the aliens were here to take, they could stay in the Oort Cloud or outer planets where the gravity well is shallow, and strip mine our system for natural resources and we wouldn’t even be able to throw anything that high to stop them.We could just watch and shake our fists as they steal our future at their leisure. They wouldn’t even have to send their people. They could use robots on ten systems at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always thought that comets come from the Oort cloud, but apparently short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disk—similar to the exocometary belts in these images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42888326</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study highlighting how the muscles that control ear movement in animals, particularly cats, may enhance their listening abilities. Researchers found that wiggling the ears, which is often an involuntary action, can improve the ability to process sounds by adjusting the direction of ear orientation. This behavior allows for more precise gathering of auditory information, suggesting a potential evolutionary advantage. The findings could have implications for understanding auditory processing in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I trained myself to wiggle one ear as a kid and it's exactly like this. The muscle is much stronger in that ear and there's a weird reflex that when something startles me from behind, the same muscle that makes the ear wiggle triggers. It happens in the untrained ear as well.Weird phenomenon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's money here to whoever can capture the activation of these muscles to control prosthetic cat ears. At the rate I see them the prosthetic cat ear market must be double-digit billions.Seriously, though, it makes me wonder if the activation of these muscles could be used in a hearing aid application. Why not add a couple rear-facing highly directional mics and use these muscles to control their gain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s muscles in my ears that I have conscious control of that don’t really seem to do anything other than make a rumbling sound. They were fun to use when I was young playing, since I could make explosion sounds and get a realistic rumbling bass too. Are these the same muscles?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886867</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "ldump" provides a tool for dumping and analyzing the data structures of linked lists in C programs. It features features such as tracing list operations, visualizing list contents, and debugging assistance for developers working with linked lists. The project aims to enhance understanding and manipulation of linked lists, making it useful for both education and practical applications in C programming.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it only has to accept a very limited subset of Lua anyway, so you may switch to a non-Lua format which is made easy to parse. That way the library has a total control over what is being evaluated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm afraid I spent too much time with LUA lately and fell in love with its simplicity. Kinda hard to go back to OOP after that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"lump" would have been a nice name&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886079</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Katherine Rundell discusses the importance of children's literature, emphasizing how it not only fosters imagination and creativity but also shapes a child's understanding of the world. Rundell argues that children's books provide essential moral and emotional lessons, helping young readers navigate complex feelings and societal issues. She highlights the enduring power of storytelling in connecting generations and cultivating empathy and curiosity in children, ultimately making a case for the crucial role of quality children's literature in education and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

"Firstly, there are many exceptions. For example, Aravis in CS Lewis's The Horse and His Boy is neither white nor remotely quiet - she is aristocratic. The Telmarine descended characters in the later books in the series are (in our terms) mixed race, and this was one of the most successful chidlren's book series ever, written in the 1950s.  The Family from One End Street (which i remember reading as a child) was published in 1937 and is about a working class family.Even Kipling is better than the article gives him credit for "You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din!"I think some bias towards middle class[1] characters and settings is inevitable because authors are middle class and write about what they know."You can only be a hero, we have told children, if you have that kind of name: names licked clean by kings and queens."BS, as a non-white kid growing up in 70s and 80s Britain I never felt this. The author thinks people can only identify with characters like themselves, which is condescending."That is changing now, albeit slowly: books such as Malorie Blackman’s Pig Heart Boy, Patrice Lawrence’s triumphant People Like Stars and Tola Okogwu’s Onyeka and the Academy of the Sun"Three British authors![1] the British definition of middle class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rarely does an article swing paraphrase by paragraph between interesting analysis and the opposite as much as this.Edit: guilty of my own snark, here is an excerpt from the conclusion that I appreciate:&gt; There’s no doubt that reading for pleasure as a child can change your life. It is a key predictor of economic success later in life. But the main reason to help children seek out books is this: if you cut a person off from reading, you’re a thief. You cut them off from the song that humanity has been singing for thousands of years. You cut them off from what we have laid out for the next generation, and the next. It’s in the technology of writing that we’ve preserved our boldest, most original thought, our best jokes and most generous comfort. To fail to do everything we can to help children hear that song is a cruelty – and a stupidity – for which we should not expect to be forgiven. We need to be infinitely more furious that there are children without books.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42881913</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The page provides an overview of the Bitfield Script, a lightweight scripting language designed for automating tasks in the command line. It emphasizes its simplicity and flexibility, allowing users to write concise scripts that can integrate with existing command-line tools. The documentation includes installation instructions, usage examples, and details on the language's features, syntax, and design philosophy, aiming to help users create efficient automation scripts easily. The project also encourages community contributions and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Why shouldn't it be as easy to write system administration programs in Go as it is in a typical shell?

1. Shell scripting offers infinite functionality. You can shell script with any program in any language. All it needs to do is take input and produce output. And if the functionality doesn't exist, you can create it on the fly, without having to follow any of the traditional rules of programming.2. Shell scripting is a combination of a grammar, operators, a few simple functions, and an extremely loose coupling with generic i/o and logic. I don't know Go well, but it probably doesn't support a similar flexibility. (most languages are very proscriptive about how you can use the language, so you usually can't make things as easy as they are in a different, more tailored language/interface/paradigm. this is why we have DSLs)3. Programmers don't really understand the concept of productivity [outside of programming itself]. A programmer would solve a problem by taking 6 weeks to design a perfect program to do the thing. A Sysadmin would take 5 minutes with a shitty language and a shitty tool and get way more done in less time. And re-writing everything into a Go library would always be slower than shell scripting, because it requires re-implementing what a shell script would just use as-is.Scripting is duct-taping the wheel rather than reinventing it. If you want to save yourself a whole lot of time and trouble, just use the duct tape.(also: don't go templates exist? why isn't that used for scripting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just rewrote a tangled 500 line shell script in go.It was my first time writing a golang project at work, so I'm sure it could have been better. But writing it the naive way, with all the required golang error handling, it ended up taking about 10x more lines of code in golang than the original bash script.It does have a dramatically better UX (largely thanks to spf13's cobra and viper), and is way faster than the original, and the codebase is a lot cleaner and more maintainable. So I think it was worthwhile for the users and maintainers.But still, 10x more lines of code. I like the OP, but I'm still not sure I would reach for golang for short shell scripts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pairing this with yaegi [1] would be interesting. You could having a REPL open doing os operations and when you get the data looking like you want, you select which lines to save to a file.[1] https://github.com/traefik/yaegi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889465</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are alive. And your prognosis, if I am to understand correctly, is overall good.This Sunday marks the fourth anniversary of my wife's passing at just 46 years old. She had unending nausea, and major motility issues. They also thought gastroparesis at first, and her doctor and surgeon even developed a surgery just for her, which I understand they won awards for. It helped her for about 2 months,  and she started regaining weight, but her symptoms- unable to hold down food of any kind- returned.From there things just got worse. G-J tube feedings with formula. Then TPN, which her body also rejected. And then... the actual starving. Her body refused any sort of nutrition from any source, even directly into her bloodstream.Doctors essentially gave up. She was on hospice for quite a while. She had started off as a large woman and when she passed, she weighed about 55lbs.I tell you this not to scare you or make you worry, but to make sure you're grateful for the health you do have, OP.They never did figure out what was wrong with her. Official cause of death was "malnutrition." Right. Gastrointestinal mysteries such as yours, and hers, really underline the fact that as much as medicine does know about the human body, there is an infinite more that they don't know about it.Best of luck to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So my kid has ARFID. I am not a doctor, but what I have learned is that eventually, anything that causes nausea associated with eating can progress into ARFID, even if the original underlying cause resolves. ARFID is technically an eating disorder, like anorexia, but it isn't related to poor body image; it is, basically, a food aversion to, well, food. All food, or nearly all. This is what happened to my kid; there’s an underlying disorder that can be treated with meds, but when not treated causes nearly constant nausea. Once we diagnosed and treated the underlying cause, the nausea didn’t go away. My kid's brain had learned to associate eating with being sick, and that association persisted even when the original illness resolved.My kid at one point was admitted to the hospital for two weeks because said kid had lost so much weight. They inserted a gastric tube, and kid discovered that kid did not become nauseous when fed through the tube. We knew kid had ARFID, but this was ah “a-ha” moment for kid, because it showed kid irrefutable proof that the problem was not a physical issue with kid's gut. It was very clearly related to the experience of eating. Kid has subsequently learned to “eat through the nausea” as described in the post.That's what this sounds like. There was likely an underlying physical cause of the nausea; that cause may or may not have resolved, but the nausea is now it's own thing. The OP indicates a series of consults with a behaviorist; I would imagine being screened for eating disorders is what that was about, but ARFID is not a common eating disorder, and may or may not have been considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey there, i have crohns' which isn't nausea based for me but definitely i understand the debilitating nature of gastrointestinal issues. It really just kills your ability to think, to talk socially, it completely and totally stole my adolescence. I'm sure you've done endless research, I'm not gonna tell you i have a cure. But if you haven't, you should look into gut microbiota. My understanding is that the balance of types of bacteria in the stomach and intestines has so so so much more to do with our daily experience than anyone realizes. And that any kind of infection or antibiotic regiment or just normal living can precipitate a change in the balance that just obliterates peoples lives. And we just don't know much at all about it yet. I've seen many people talk over the years about experimenting with different probiotics, even down to ordering exact strains of bacteria to make yogurt and test. If you need a new path to research and try things you can look there. As i said, doctors don't know much about it yet so it you probably can't find one to guide you through it. You'll have to figure it out, but it's possible, people have been helped, and at the end of it all, i hope it gets better for you. &lt;3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889700</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the presentation titled "SixOS: A Nix OS without systemd" from the Chaos Communication Congress 2019. The speaker, focusing on the SixOS operating system, explains its unique design which emphasizes simplicity and minimalism by excluding systemd, a widely used init system in many Linux distributions. The presentation highlights the features and advantages of SixOS, including its package management approach, ease of use, and the implications of avoiding systemd for system stability and user control. Overall, it promotes an alternative vision for operating system development that aligns with the principles of modularity and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

Genuinely I'm not sure anymore: It is chock full of features and it gets the job done. Since it is used in a lot of big distributions it gets a lot of fixes, updates, testing and feature improvements regularly.Yes, it is maybe monolithic (but so is the Linux kernel). Its philosophy may differ from unix's "get one thing done well" too but integration of various functionalities comes with its benefits.Some people say it is bloated. The substitutes to systemd are lightweight but less featureful. Maybe some of them will get bloated as they achieve feature parity.People have a right to build substitutes and replacements -- I believe in the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" philosopy. However I can't understand why systemd is the point of so much disagreement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool.  I especially like the better encrypted boot support and that it seems to harmonize better with nixpkgs (https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sixos-a-nix-os-without-systemd...).  Curious about the infusions bit.It not having systemd seems like a bit of a distraction from all of the other stuff that has gone into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884727</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses scenarios in which greedy algorithms can outperform optimal algorithms in terms of speed and efficiency. It highlights specific cases and mathematical contexts where a greedy approach not only simplifies problem-solving but also reduces computational complexity. The author provides examples that illustrate how, despite the potentially suboptimal nature of greedy algorithms, they can yield quicker results compared to more exhaustive methods, making them advantageous in certain situations. Furthermore, the post emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem domain to effectively choose the right algorithm for a given task.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't really what the article is about, but I don't think that the term "Greedy algorithm" means what the author thinks.Greedy algorithms are about making locally optimal choices.They are not "brute force" algorithms or inefficient ones.In fact, greedy algorithms are almost always faster. They are faster because they consider only local information instead of the entire data set. In exchange for that, a greedy algorithm may produce non-optimal answers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m surprised they didn’t mention the reason that the rejection sampling method is surprisingly fast: the probability of needing to resample N times decreases exponentially with N. So even for the 3D case, where 50% of your samples get rejected, the EV for number of samples required is about 2.This is also a good case study on the difference between throughput sensitive vs latency sensitive applications. The rejection sampling is fast on average, but the analytical solution likely has a much tighter upper bound on how long it can take. In a throughput application you care about EV.  But if you need to minimize latency, then you care about the upper bound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know how numerics in hardware works, but would the use of functions like sin, cos, sqrt incur a penalty as well, even if only a slight one?It's really fascinating to think about how all of this would work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853904</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These guys write really great papers!We implemented a simplified version of their ring index for our data space (https://github.com/triblespace/tribles-rust/blob/master/src/...), and it's a really simple and cool idea once you wrap your head around it. Funnily enough, we build this even before the paper was officially published, because we found a preprint on one of the authors blogs. The idea itself was published by them before but their new paper made this a lot easier to understand. (burrows wheeler transforms vs. stable column sorting).It's really too bad that the whole linked-data space is completely gunked up with RDF.Ps: If anyone plans on implementing their ring index, using 0 based offsets makes the formulas much more streamlined, their paper uses 1 based indexing and they have to +/-1 all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think if someone is just trying out RDF, it is better to start with Apache Jena/Fuseki or Eclipse RDF4J. Maybe https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph if you like to live dangerously (i.e. to use pre-1.0 DBMSs).Use of other systems involves factoring tradeoffs and considerations that are probably not the best for the newcomers. For example, qLever mentioned here is good in query performance and relative disk use but once the import is done, it's essentially a read-only DB and completely unsuitable for a typical OLTP scenario.Having said that, the Chilean research group that is driving the development of MilleniumDB is very well-regarded in the RDF/semantic web querying space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MilleniumDB is an interesting engine, as is Qlever mentioned in other comments. I think both are good candidates at making RDF graphs one or two orders of magnitude cheaper to host as sparql endpoints.Both seem to have arrived at the stage of transitioning from research to production code.Very exiting for those of us providing our data in RDF and exposing Sparql.AWs Neptune analytics is also very interesting, allowing Cypher on RDF graphs. Even the Oracle inbuilt RDF+Sparql  seems to have improved greatly in 23ai.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42888195</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of watchdog timers in embedded systems, explaining their purpose in ensuring system reliability by resetting the system in case of software malfunctions or hangs. It outlines different strategies for implementing watchdog timers, including hardware and software approaches, and highlights the importance of properly configuring these timers to avoid unintended resets. The author emphasizes the balance between responsiveness to genuine failures and system stability, recommending practices for effective watchdog timer usage to enhance overall system robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;His may not be a familiar name 'round these parts, but Jack Ganssle is a legend in the embedded systems industry. And he's very helpful to boot.Many lifetimes ago, as a freshly baked software engineer, I had a strong interest in Embedded Systems. Juggling interrupts, wrangling registers, counting clock cycles, banging bits, reading sensors, often in raw assembly so as to fit into limited flash memory was my idea of fun.So much so that I was contemplating doing a Master's degree in that area. However, I couldn't find a US University with a good program for that. I had seen Jack being very active on a few embedded-related forums, and on a lark, I emailed him for advice.And he responded! He gave me very sound advice, effectively explaining that graduate research in Embedded Systems is quite distinct from the actual low-level work that happens in the industry. This explained why I hadn't found any of the programs appealing. I took his advice gratefully and pursued a different area for my Master's, which shaped the rest of my career. Thanks again, Jack!I always intended to come back to Embedded Systems at some point, but unfortunately it never worked out. Partially because embedded engineers are criminally underpaid for the complexity of the work they do. As the article hints, writing software that runs reliably in arbitrarily harsh environments on low-cost, cheap, quirky hardware with extremely constrained resources is a different level of challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WDT patterns are highly underrated, even in pure software there's value in degrading/recovering gracefully vs systems that have to be "perfect" 100% of the time and then force user intervention when they go wrong.One of my favorite blogs on the topic https://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html that does a great job of covering how Erlang approached the topic, lots of learnings that can be applied more broadly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've taken a number of MCUs through radiation testing including testing watchdogs. I've generally found that latchups often take out the watchdogs, even something like the STm32 independent watchdogs, and shouldn't be relied on.
External hardware or a different system need to be deputized here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42893393</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish this article was written with a less biased tone. I'm genuinely interested in understanding it better.As far as I can tell, the article cites two things: $500M tax savings by using an accelerated depreciation schedule (unclear if they saved $500M more by using accelerated vs a regular depreciation schedule, but I assume no) and they claimed $300M in tax credits.The article doesn't address the other $1.5B, presumably because it's easier to defend. I didn't read through the 10-K to try and figure this out.I don't really know enough about what an accelerated depreciation schedule implies, but, taken at face value, they'd have to pay more in taxes in a deferred year which doesn't seem like foul play to me. Tax credits seem to make sense for an EV company?EDIT: I did some learning, woohoo.Federal corporate tax rate in America is 21%. The $300M in tax credits is post-tax not pre-tax. The $500M is a pre-tax deduction.$2.3B - $0.5B = $1.8B$1.8B * 0.21 = $378M$378M - $300M = $78MSo, I can't really explain why they didn't owe ~$78M in taxes, but I assume rounding and cursory other stuff. The article probably didn't call out other, minor deductions, but it's also fair of them to not have done so. I was wrong when I said, "The article doesn't address the other $1.5B, presumably because it's easier to defend."I think the real thing here is the weaponization of EV tax credits as some sort of boogeyman. Personally, I'm all for incentivizing EV companies to create in America.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "hoard wealth"&gt; No mention of reinvestment&gt; "Tesla was able to avoid paying ... taxes ... by claiming ... tax credits" (presented as bad somehow)&gt; "We're not backing down"Where or where is the media coverage that attempts to speak to people who don't already buy in to the premise? This isn't journalism it might as well be blogging. Congratulations, you've made the world more polarized!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know what’s ironic is that Tesla survived because of Obama era subsidies. They were desperate to get one private enterprise to succeed because so many solar and other “clean” energy private ventures failed during that period. So, in my view, Obama created Elon. Now the rest of America has to deal with it in addition to the abject failure that is PPACA which ballooned US healthcare costs (not that Republicans have any alternative solutions or the desire to fix it).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42893365</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI: For Flux, there is a lot more power in the text-encoder &amp; you can prompt with more meaningful and comprehensive sentences. Thus, less of the traditional comma separated &amp; concise phrasing we saw in stable diffusion.You should do the same with your training images. Caption everything you do not want the model to remember as "you" (what you're doing, wearing, accompanied by, accessories, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did this for our beloved, dead cat... On replicate, too. I loved the results, until at one point I suddenly got really creeped out about the thing I was doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replicate does make this particularly easy while still being somewhat developer focused. I've used it for a few people in our group chat so we can make silly in-joke memes and stuff and the results are quite stunning. Replicate then offers the model up over a simple API (shown in the post) if you wanted to let people generate right from the chat, etc. Replicate is worth poking around a bit more broadly, too, they have some interesting models on there (though the pricing tends not to be very competitive if you were going to do it at scale.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889236</guid></item><item><title>37.

Instead these newly-owned water companies then took humungous loans which they paid to the buyers.  So the buyers got the money and the water companies got the debt to service.Now everyone wonders why the water companies, who are charging more than ever and have a really failing system, are going bankrupt...?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holy moly I wasn’t expecting that map to be so busy.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As context, the NSF requires grant writers to include a “broader impacts” section [1] in every grant proposal. This includes things like improving education, national security, economic competitiveness, and also inclusion - for example, ideas to attract more talent from underrepresented groups. So every NSF proposer works hard to satisfy the NSF on this requirement. I happen to think that these are worthwhile goals (we shouldn’t be wasting our limited talent due to historical crankiness) and simultaneously I believe the sections ends up being a bit performative. If the NSF were to change its criteria for grants going forward I might disagree with that approach but it would be consistent with what I’ve heard from these folks, ie they think “DEI” is getting in the way of science. However: the current approach is just destructive: if involves asking researchers to augment their proposals with these goals, and then retroactively refuses to pay already-awarded grant recipients who did what they were asked to.I will leave the question of whether this is constitutional to other folks. I will even leave aside the question of whether we can afford to defund science in our current crazy geopolitical environment. The real point here is that this is just plain wrong.[1] https://new.nsf.gov/funding/learn/broader-impacts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will not miss the “DEI” components of NSF proposals (or the PIER part of the DOE ones), especially having been on the review panel side about 5 times now.  It’s not that I disagree with their intent, but the fact that after you’ve read a few you realize that proposers know exactly what they are expected to write there, so they write that there.  Those sections are basically a useless going-through-the-motions exercise, and everyone knows it.  I’ve never seen a proposal win or lose, or even change positions in a tie break, based on that content.  More or less we just look to see that it exists, indicate that existence in the review form, and concentrate on the actual content.  It’s a performative waste of everyone’s time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without going into the discussion about polarized points. I have some observations1- NSF budget is about 10 billions, I always had in mind that it is much more. That's about 0.17% of the total federal budget. If we include DOE R&amp;D funding and NIH we will get to 1%. This is the funding for most of research in science in the US. Seems like not a great area to achieve huge reduction in deficit.2- Even if we ignore the whole point of DEI and say that we need to end support for some of the projects. You do take your time and evaluate projects that needs to take action. You don't stop all the funding and pause critical support for projects and cause huge problems on medium and long term. And it also hurt the reputation of the country and its competitiveness.3- The current NSF director was actually appointed by the current setting president in his first term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886661</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a little puzzled why Ghostty is so suddenly popular. I've tried it, it's OK but it's not as good as kitty, and it's implementing the protocols that kitty invented to make the terminal experience better. Kitty is cross platform, fast, visually pared back, and really featured. I keep finding new things like it's got a protocol for copying files over ssh sessions, and the hints system is really neat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghostty is great and a lot of fun, only thing missing to me is search scrollback. https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/189 They know about this and I think the current answer from them is just use tmux or the like. Only thing missing though, otherwise a fun pleasant experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switched over from Iterm - A fundamental feature I'm missing is the search feature (Cmd + F).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884930</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One wonders at which point models will be sneaky enough to bypass simple eval sandboxes. The article has:    # Evaluate the equation with restricted globals and locals
    result = eval(equation, {"__builtins__": None}, {})

but that's not enough as you can rebuild access to builtins from objects and then go from there: https://ideone.com/qzNtyuBy the way, writing this greatly benefited from DeepThink-r1 while o1 just gave me a lobotomized refusal (CoT: "The user's request involves injecting code to bypass a restricted Python environment, suggesting a potential interest in illegal activities. This is a serious matter and aligns closely with ethical guidelines."). So I just cancelled my ChatGPT subscription - why did we ever put up with this? "This distillation thingie sounds pretty neat!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's surprising about this is how sparsely defined the rewards are. Even if the model learns the formatting reward, if it never chances upon a solution, there isn't any feedback/reward to push it to learn to solve the game more often.So what are the chances of randomly guessing a solution?The toy Countdown dataset here has 3 to 4 numbers, which are combined with 4 symbols (+, -, x, ÷). With 3 numbers there are 3! * 4^3 = 384 possible symbol combinations, with 4 there are 6144. By the tensorboard log [0], even after just 10 learning steps, the model already has a success rate just below 10%. If we make the simplifying assumption that the model hasn't learned anything in 10 steps, then the probability of 1 (or more) success in 80 chances (8 generations are used per step), guessing randomly for a success rate of 1/384 on 3-number problems, is 1.9%. One interpretation is to take this as a p-value, and reject that the model's base success rate is completely random guessing - the base model already has slightly above chance success rate at solving the 3-number CountDown game.This aligns with my intuition - I suspect that with proper prompting, LLMs should be able to solve CountDown decently OK without any training. Though maybe not a 3B model?The model likely "parlays" its successes on 3 numbers to start to learn to solve 4 numbers. Or has it? The final learned ~50% success rate matches the frequency of 4-number problems in Jiayi Pan's CountDown dataset [1]. Phil does provide examples of successful 4-number solutions, but maybe the model hasn't become consistent at 4 numbers yet.[0]: https://www.philschmid.de/static/blog/mini-deepseek-r1/tenso...
[1]: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiayi-Pan/Countdown-Tasks-3t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"ConclusionThe release of DeepSeek R1 and its research paper might be breakpoint for the open-science and open-source development. Just a week after DeepSeek release, we've been able to reproduce a simple version of R1 learned "reasoning" using GRPO and the Countdown Game. While our implementation focuses on a specific task rather than general reasoning and convergence into a very specific "reasoning" format, it shows that the method is working.In our mini R1 experiment we used GRPO, with two rule-based reward but already required significant compute: 4 H100 GPUs running for 6 hours to complete just 450 training steps on a 3B parameter model."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884834</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many here are trashing on Ollama, saying it's "just" nice porcelain around llama.cpp and it's not doing anything complicated. Okay. Let's stipulate that.So where's the non-sketchy, non-for-profit equivalent? Where's the nice frontend for llama.cpp that makes it trivial for anyone who wants to play around with local LLMs without having to know much about their internals? If Ollama isn't doing anything difficult, why isn't llama.cpp as easy to use?Making local LLMs accessible to the masses is an essential job right now—it's important to normalize owning your data as much as it can be normalized. For all of its faults, Ollama does that, and it does it far better than any alternative. Maybe wait to trash it for being "just" a wrapper until someone actually creates a viable alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;llama.cpp has supported vulkan for more than a year now.  For more than 6 months now there has been an open PR to add vulkan backend support for Ollama.  However, Ollama team has not even looked at it or  commented on it.Vulkan backends are existential for running LLMs on consumer hardware (iGPUs especially).  It's sad to see Ollama miss this opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ollama was good initially in that it made LLMs more accessible for non-technical people while everyone was figuring things out.Lately they seem to be contributing mostly confusion to the conversation.The #1 model the entire world is talking about is literally mislabeled their side. There is no such thing as R1-1.5b. Quantization without telling users also confuses noobs as to what is possible. Setting up an api different from the thing they're wrapping adds chaos. And claiming each feature added llama.cpp as something "ollama now supports" is exceedingly questionable especially when combined with the very sparse acknowledgement that it's a wrapper at all.Whole thing just doesn't have good vibes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886680</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did not find the article very compelling.
The biggest problem is the lack of context. What kind of products is the author talking about? I got the impression that this is mostly about SaaS offerings, but who knows?
Moreover, the arguments presented are insufficient with regards to it's thesis.
The author claims that traffic spikes are actually harmful, but then just argues that they are mostly irrelevant.
The only argument towards actual harmfulness presented is that disappointed users could spread negative sentiment. I don't find that very convincing.
Something conspicuously absent from the article is a discussion of conversion cost. If you have a freemium offering how much do free users actually cost you? Especially for consumer facing software the cost can be really low. It's not like you have a sales team doing calls with each potential customer, people crowding your store. 
Might a surge of signups still be profitable, even if the conversion rate is much worse?
But even if you accept that unmitigated spikes are harmful, aren't the remedies easy to apply. If you notice an unwanted spike you can easily increase friction by e.g. limiting new signups to referrals until the spike is over, temporarily restricting your free tier, etc. 
In conclusion, traffic spikes might not be that harmful and are easy enough mitigated as to not warrant taking action to prevent them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that didn't seem obvious from the article is that "looking" means signing up. If this is the case, it's a conscious choice of the vendor.On the other hand, I do know that it's a widespread feeling among salespeople, that a person who interacts with them, without buying anything, is stealing from them. And wasting someone's time in order to make them feel like they owe you something is a familiar bargaining tactic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; these shitty usersGod. You’ll never be successful if you are that insulting to your users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42887598</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing trend of businesses and organizations treating every aspect of their operations as a profit center, raising concerns about the implications this has on social values and community interests. It warns that this mindset can lead to prioritizing financial gain over the well-being of individuals and communities, ultimately commodifying essential services and relationships. The piece emphasizes the need to reevaluate this approach and consider the ethical implications of reducing everything to a monetary value, advocating for a balance between profit and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

Never contact your insurance company unless you plan on filing a claim, just asking for this list is equivalent to a claim.If you have a valid claim, your insurance can't force you to use a list of vendors.  You can choose any vendor you want to.   The vendors work/cost must be appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This can be a sleazy industry. Servpro is the big corporate side, but the New York Times reported a few years ago about actual criminal intimidation in the industry (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/nyregion/fire-truck-chase...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So if I understand this correctly, this company gets certain information about 911 calls, and then sells it to third parties?I wonder how much information they get, because this could get a lot darker. Imagine if calls to the police reporting domestic violence resulted in advertising material from divorce lawyers. (A domestic violence victim might well want a divorce lawyer, but unsolicited material showing up in their mailbox may put them at risk by enraging their already-violent spouse.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889777</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Ge Wang's perspective on generative AI, arguing that its application in art is one of the least imaginative uses possible. Wang emphasizes that while AI can generate art, it often lacks the depth and emotional engagement that traditional human-created art provides. He advocates for a more meaningful integration of AI in the creative process, focusing on enhancing rather than replacing human creativity. The discussion highlights the potential of AI as a tool for collaboration rather than as a mere producer of content.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's because this technology isn't (and never has been) intended for the laborers making the stuff. The ultimate aim of these companies is to address the managerial and c suite people with a product that can replace the labor pool.Honestly, I think the current consumer focus is just an irrational consequence of these companies feeling like they can't leave all that consumer money on the table, but, precisely for the reasons this piece outlines, it makes no sense to market this stuff to people who actually like their craft. These tools are purely intended for superficial people who are not interested in creating things, they are only interested in outputs and end results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GenAI is not capable of making art. Self expression is not only inherent in art, it’s essential. What AI does is make pretty pictures, but nothing more. It’s not a tool for making art because it removes the means for artistic expression. It’s possible for someone to make art from GenAI outputs, but that requires taking artistic liberties post generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of all the things I do with AI, art is probably the one I do the most.  When you create written content on the internet, "the algorithm" rewards you more if you add art to it.  I am not an artist, but I can write good.So when I'm done writing, I pop over to my AI image generator, describe a few images I want, pop them into the post, and away I go!  And then boom, greater engagement.  As an added bonus, I don't have to worry about copyright, because at the moment copyright law considers me the creator if I modify it or the AI (which makes it uncopywriteable).  So I'm in the clear there (for now).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891821</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent statement from the U.S. Copyright Office suggesting that the ongoing debate about copyright and artificial intelligence (AI) may have been effectively settled by legal precedents established in 1965. It highlights the challenges and complexities surrounding copyright protection for works generated by AI, referencing historical cases to argue for a clearer framework. The article also explores the implications of this stance for creators, businesses, and the future of AI-generated content in relation to intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The headline is either sloppy or intentionally misleading: the Copyright Office is saying that the law surrounding whether AI generated works can be copyrighted was settled in 1965 (the answer being "yes if AI assisted a human creative process, no if not, and we have to decide on a case by case basis if there was enough human input to qualify"). This has been their stance all along, but now they've provided a bit more guidance on what counts as human input, which is helpful.What this article doesn't talk about at all is the far more controversial AI copyright debate, the one most people will think of given the headline: whether training a model is fair use. That's the one everyone is actually concerned about, and they're definitely not claiming it was settled already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Where a human inputs their own copyrightable work and that work is perceptible in the output, they will be the author of at least that portion of the output," the guidelines said.This policy is sensible. Most AI generated works should be uncopyrightable, except where a substantial human contribution is in the output.Simply describing a picture and letting AI generate it shouldn't be enough for the same reason that dictating what you want to a painter isn't enough to earn you copyright over the resulting painting.I would be wary about integrating too much AI output into works one wants to enforce copyright over without some level of documentation. The nightmare scenario is having your copyright stripped away because of evidence one used AI extensively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It says they were not able to reproduce an image with the same prompt. So they just didn't know about seeds?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884473</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Complexity&gt; We present a polynomial-time algorithm achieving an approximation ratio below √2 for MVC, providing strong evidence that P = NP by efficiently solving a computationally hard problem with near-optimal solutions.&gt; This result contradicts the Unique Games Conjecture, suggesting that many optimization problems may admit better solutions, revolutionizing theoretical computer science.Some context: The Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) is a very central unsolved problem in theoretical computer science (TCS), it's open since 2002. It conjectures that, for a series of standard optimization problems including minimum vertex cover, the best known approximation factor (how close you can guarantee to get to optimality with a poly time algorithm) is actually the best possible approximation factor. To disprove the conjecture, one needs a better approximation algorithm for one of those problems. Such an algorithm could be used to solve (to optimality, and in poly time) another set of problems, which are widely believed to be NP-hard. This would not prove P=NP (to be clear: the above quote is not claiming that), but it is true it would revolutionize TCS.The thing is: this is TCS and theoretical complexity. You cannot disprove UGC with just code. You need a mathematical proof. This is not an indictment of the code which may be very good. But such an enormous claim would require pretty intense scrutiny before it would be accepted as true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is just BS.If you follow their paper, their "inductive" argument can also prove that the result is optimal (the sqrt(2) constant is taken from thin air and may also be replaced by 1 without changing the proof).My guess is that they tested some graphs, and "empirically" saw a bound of sqrt(2), and then came up with a proof to self-fulfill the profecy. They even mention that "for very small graphs, the approximation ratio may briefly exceed sqrt(2)", which is just nuts, given that they have a formal proof that it should never happen.In case anyone read the paper and can't figure out the mistake in the proof, they assume that OPT_T + OPT_R = OPT, which is obviously false.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42838392</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not surprising, and I expect more of this in the decade to come. It feels like we’re finally seeing companies begin to draw lines in the sand on where their interests actually lay: power (which Texas grants in spades), profit (which Delaware has historically protected), or values (in which case they would incorporate/move to a place that aligns with said values - of which vanishingly few companies do).If anything, it’s kinda…helpful? As a consumer, I mean. If I see a company moving from CA to TX, well, that’s probably for reasons I have issue with, and therefore make it easier for me to not do business with them going forward.If companies want to advertise their actual values so openly by reincorporating in another state, well, more power to them I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Source WSJ article: https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-incorporation-texas-delware-f0...&gt; Last year, Delaware’s legislature made it easier for big shareholders to use stockholder agreements to assume powers normally held by a company’s board. The Delaware Chancery Court also ruled in Meta’s favor in April, dismissing a case that argued the company had to consider societal impacts in addition to chasing profits.I wonder if this is an attempt to disempower minority shareholders (i.e. anyone that isn't Zuck)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't imagine what it's like at Meta right now, with the CEO publicly stating that they're firing the bottom 5% of performers and then a week later stating that the LLMs that his researchers / engineers are working on will soon be able to replace them.Zuck needs Yann LeCun and other senior researchers at Meta a lot more than they need him. If they were to quit there would be a line out the door to hand them as much money as they want to start a competing open research lab. I bet a ton of top researchers from other labs would be happy to join too, since from what I've heard from friends they're all miserable from dealing with incompetent management.On current trajectory one of Sam Altman / Zuck / Elon will end up having full control over the frontier models that are trained on their huge new clusters. All 3 of them are unaccountable to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42890960</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a project that visualizes the entire ISBN space, which is a unique identifier for books. It explains the significance of ISBNs in categorizing and organizing books and demonstrates how the visualization reveals patterns and trends in the book publishing industry. The author presents interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the spatial distribution of books based on their ISBNs, highlighting clusters and gaps that may indicate certain publishing trends or categories. The project aims to enhance understanding of the book market and encourage further exploration of ISBN data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow.When we started Amazon, this was precisely what I wanted to do, but using Library of Congress triple classifications instead of ISBN.It turned out to be impossible because the data provider (a mixture of Baker &amp; Tayler (book distributors) and Books In Print) munged the triple classification into a single string, so you could not find the boundaries reliably.Had to abandon the idea before I even really got started on it, and it would certainly have been challenging to do this sort of "flythrough" in the 1994-1995 version of "the web".Kudos!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s not uncommon for an ISBN to have been assigned multiple times to different books [0]. Thus “all books in ISBN space” may be an overstatement.There’s also the problem of books with invalid ISBNs, i.e. where the check digit doesn’t match the rest of the ISBN, but where correcting the check digit would match a different book. These books would be outside of the ISBN space assumed by the blog post.[0] https://scis.edublogs.org/2017/09/28/the-dreaded-case-of-dup...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impressive presentation.Note: The presentation reflects the contents of Anna's archive exclusively, rather than the entire ISBN catalog. There is a discernible bias towards a limited range of languages, due to Anna's collection bias to those languages. The sections marked in black represent the missing entries in the archive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897120</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advancements in Swift's build technologies, highlighting the transition to a new build system that aims to improve performance, reliability, and ease of use. It outlines key features of the new system, including faster incremental builds, improved error handling, and a more modular architecture. The developers emphasize the importance of community feedback in refining these changes and encourage users to participate in the ongoing development process to enhance Swift's capabilities. Overall, the post signals a commitment to evolving Swift's build environment to better support developers' needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe that this long game of Swift being "good for everything" but "better for Apple platforms" will be detrimental to the language. This does not help the language nor seems to bring more people to the ecosystem.Competitors seems to have a combination of:
- Being more open-source
- Have more contributors
- Have a narrower scopeMaybe they should consider open sourcing all the tooling (like Xcode) otherwise the gap will only grow over time when compared to other languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swift is a really cool language.But one thing that blows my mind is that if you ever encounter an "index out of range" error, the (massive) error message that you get doesn't tell you anything about where this error occurred... no line number... no nothing...    let a = [1]
    print(a[1])

Is all you have to do to reproduce the error.The error looks something like that https://pastebin.com/MQV82SaRAnd gives you no useful information as to how it happened or how to fix it.compare that with Golang which tells you, it happened in main.go at line 4.    panic: runtime error: index out of range [1] with length 1
    
    goroutine 1 [running]:
    main.main()
     /Users/username/main.go:4 +0x15
    exit status 2

EDIT: with the LLVM_SYMBOLIZER_PATH set https://pastebin.com/8M9Dbrgj this doesn't provide anything useful either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swift itself is a great piece of tech.But it is doomed to fail as a general widely adopted language unless apple makes few critical moves including open sourcing everything including XCode, providing support for 3d party IDE developers (because xcode is terrible), creating decent package manager, adopting testing as first class citizen etc.There is just no economical sense for anyone to invest in swift until all the above (and some more) is done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899703</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the efforts of archivists trying to identify and preserve thousands of datasets that are disappearing from Data.gov, the U.S. government's primary platform for public data. It highlights the significance of these datasets for transparency, accountability, and research, emphasizing the challenges archivists face in tracking, storing, and ensuring the availability of this information as government priorities shift and digital data management evolves. The piece underscores the importance of maintaining accessible public data for societal benefit and the potential consequences of its loss.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm quoted in this article. Happy to discuss what we're working on at the Library Innovation Lab if anyone has questions.There's lots of people making copies of things right now, which is great -- Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe. It's your data, why not have a copy?One thing I think we can contribute here as an institution is timestamping and provenance. Our copy of data.gov is made with https://github.com/harvard-lil/bag-nabit , which extends BagIt format to sign archives with email/domain/document certificates. That way (once we have a public endpoint) you can make your own copy with rclone, pass it around, but still verify it hasn't been modified since we made it.Some open questions we'd love help on --* One is that it's hard to tell what's disappearing and what's just moving. If you do a raw comparison of snapshots, there's things like 2011-glass-buttes-exploration-and-drilling-535cf being replaced by 2011-glass-buttes-exploration-and-drilling-236cf, but it's still exactly the same data; it's a rename rather than a delete and add. We need some data munging to work out what's actually changing.* Another is how to find the most valuable things to preserve that aren't directly linked from the catalog. If a data.gov entry links to a csv, we have it. If it links to an html landing page, we have the landing page. It would be great to do some analysis to figure out the most valuable stuff behind the landing pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the USA greatest strengths is the almost unprecedented degree of transparency of governments records going back decades. We can actually see the true facts including when our government has lied to us or covered things up. Many other nations do not have this luxury and it has provided the evidentiary basis for both legal cases and "progress" in general.  Not surprising that authoritarians would target and destroy data as it makes their objective of a post-truth society that much easier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beyond federal websites (.gov, .mil) there are lot of gov contractor websites that are being taken down (presumably at the demand of agencies) that contain a wealth of information and years of project research.Some below of contractors that work with US AID:- https://www.edu-links.org/ (taken down)- https://www.genderlinks.org/ (taken down)- https://usaidlearninglab.org/ (taken down)- https://agrilinks.org/ (presumably at risk)- https://www.climatelinks.org/ (presumably at risk)- https://biodiversitylinks.org/ (presumably at risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42881367</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article "In Zig: What's a Writer?" explores the nature of being a writer, emphasizing the importance of creativity and authenticity in the writing process. It discusses various forms of writing, including fiction and non-fiction, and highlights the diverse motivations that drive individuals to write. The piece also reflects on the challenges writers face, such as self-doubt and the quest for inspiration, while encouraging a mindset of exploration and growth. Ultimately, it promotes the idea that writing can be a transformative experience, both for the writer and the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42849774"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that the problem the author writes about is bigger than the writer abstraction. To me it feels like the lack of interfaces* and inheritance in the Zig language hinders creating meaningful abstractions because you always have to use composition.Alternatively you could argue that this just isn't the right approach within the boundaries of the Zig language: don't try to abstract, just provide a meaningful implementation (in the standard library) and re-use (using composition).Note:*) Yes, I know, you can create interfaces but this introduces lots of boilerplate code where to cast/forward pointers to their correct type/implementation. For an example, the author refers to another article: https://www.openmymind.net/Zig-Interfaces/.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a lot of the confusion is just that it's not what people are used to.e.g., an anytime parameter is checked by the compiler, just a like a parameter of an interface type in a language with interfaces. In either case, if you try to pass a non-conforming type you get a compiler error.Now, with an interface, you get a symbol name you can hang your hat on. That can really help when you're in the "I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, I'm trying to figure out this API" phase of development. API documentation and design need to compensate. But you need to be past that phase before you're writing actually useful code anyway, so this isn't that big a deal. Zig's overall simplicity really mitigates this too. You're probably going to be spending less overall time in the confusion stage.(re "writer: anytype" the article says, "You either have to go through the source code and see how writer is used, or let the compiler tell you which function is expected." which is true, but also true of writer: IWriter. It also leaves off the option of reading the docs. doc comments are a first-class construct in zig, so they are pretty accessible.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using zig for a week now. When I see a construct like writer I find myself looking for complexity that is just not there. I'm pleasantly surprised by the zig language design decisions. Initially I thought allocators were a pain but now I hardly notice them after I set up the struct init and deinit. And the myriad of zig pointer and slice types make me appreciate how C has overloaded the use of certain constructs in non-intuitive ways that we've just come to accept over the decades. I'm more impressed with zig than the last half dozen languages I've picked up - and the C/C++ interop at the language and compiler level is just the icing on the cake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42849774</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The EarthSTAR Project focuses on fostering global sustainability through innovative research and community engagement. It aims to address environmental challenges by connecting scientific knowledge with local practices, promoting ecological health, and enhancing resilience to climate change. The project emphasizes collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including scientists, policymakers, and community members, to co-create solutions for sustainable living and environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks a bit like nostr except:- data is named, not content addressed (to support overwrite &amp; deletion), so the primitive data type is associative arrays  of names to documents instead of sets of messages- documents are grouped into "shares" and you have to know the "share address" before the server will acknowledge that it indeed has documents in that share.Seems like an interesting approach: part way private, part way open.  It think projects like this which pick an extreme on that axis end up suffering for it--which is most of them.I bet it would succeed at keeping the spammers and scammers out, but I'd be leery of using it with a large group against a motivated adversary--if a single user exposes the share address (which is in a gray area between public and private) it seems like all of the users of that share are exposed.  I'd prefer to see a web of trust so that an adversary has to compromise each hop on the trust graph before they find their target--but that's a lot of complexity for users to handle so I can see why keeping it simple might be worth tolerating the lack of granularity.I certainly hope that something like this succeeds.  It feels like we've lost the web and there are too many of us to coordinate en masse without something web-like--and at a time where that coordination is pretty important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not entirely following what this is?A document and media database of some sort with lots of JavaScript involved somehow? Aimed at something vaguely self-host-ish? With mastodon-ish replication to peer nodes?Seems like there is an ambitious grand vision happening here of sorts but not quite seeing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does a Python client exist? The only thing I see in the docs which is related to Python is    # Earthstar timestamps in python
    timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000 * 1000)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894200</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A later article by the same author: https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/leader-alleged-bay-ar.... Probably makes sense to read both or neither.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This story just keeps getting more and more bizarre. Reading the charges and supporting affidavits, the whole thing is reading more and more like some sort of Yorgos Lanthimos film. The rationalist connection - a literal sequel to the 2022 events (in turn a sequel to the 2019 CFAR stuff) - is already weird enough. But I can't get over the ridiculousness of the VT situation. I have spent time in that area of VT, and the charged parties must have been acting quite bizarre for the clerk to alert the police. Checking into a motel wearing all black, open carrying does NOT cut it. The phones wrapped in foil is comical, and the fact that they were surveilled over several days is interesting, especially because it reads like the FBI only became aware of their presence after the stop and shootout?The arresting agent seems pretty interesting, a former risk adjuster who recently successfully led the case against a large inter-state fraud scheme. This may just be the plot of Fargo season 10. Looking forward to the season arc of the FBI trying to understand the "rationalist" community. The episode titled "Roko's Basilisk", with no thematically tied elements, but they manage to turn Yudkowsky into a rat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Former member of that world, roommates with one of Ziz's friends for a while, so I feel reasonably qualified to speak on this.]The problem with rationalists/EA as a group has never been the rationality, but the people practicing it and the cultural norms they endorse as a community.As relevant here:1) While following logical threads to their conclusions is a useful exercise, each logical step often involves some degree of rounding or unknown-unknowns. A -&gt; B and B -&gt; C means A -&gt; C in a formal sense, but A -almostcertainly-&gt; B and B -almostcertainly-&gt; C does not mean A -almostcertainly-&gt; C. Rationalists, by tending to overly formalist approaches, tend to lose the thread of the messiness of the real world and follow these lossy implications as though they are lossless. That leads to...2) Precision errors in utility calculations that are numerically-unstable. Any small chance of harm times infinity equals infinity. This framing shows up a lot in the context of AI risk, but it works in other settings too: infinity times a speck of dust in your eye &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 times murder, so murder is "justified" to prevent a speck of dust in the eye of eternity. When the thing you're trying to create is infinitely good or the thing you're trying to prevent is infinitely bad, anything is justified to bring it about/prevent it respectively.3) Its leadership - or some of it, anyway - is extremely egotistical and borderline cult-like to begin with. I think even people who like e.g. Eliezer would agree that he is not a humble man by any stretch of the imagination (the guy makes Neil deGrasse Tyson look like a monk). They have, in the past, responded to criticism with statements to the effect of "anyone who would criticize us for any reason is a bad person who is lying to cause us harm". That kind of framing can't help but get culty.4) The nature of being a "freethinker" is that you're at the mercy of your own neural circuitry. If there is a feedback loop in your brain, you'll get stuck in it, because there's no external "drag" or forcing functions to pull you back to reality. That can lead you to be a genius who sees what others cannot. It can also lead you into schizophrenia really easily. So you've got a culty environment that is particularly susceptible to internally-consistent madness, and finally:5) It's a bunch of very weird people who have nowhere else they feel at home. I totally get this. I'd never felt like I was in a room with people so like me, and ripping myself away from that world was not easy. (There's some folks down the thread wondering why trans people are overrepresented in this particular group: well, take your standard weird nerd, and then make two-thirds of the world hate your guts more than anything else, you might be pretty vulnerable to whoever will give you the time of day, too.)TLDR: isolation, very strong in-group defenses, logical "doctrine" that is formally valid and leaks in hard-to-notice ways, apocalyptic utility-scale, and being a very appealing environment for the kind of person who goes super nuts -&gt; pretty much perfect conditions for a cult. Or multiple cults, really. Ziz's group is only one of several.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877910</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the inclusion of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) principles in scientific research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It explores the tension between the traditional scientific emphasis on objective data and the push for incorporating social factors to address health disparities. The piece highlights arguments both for and against integrating DEI into scientific methodologies, with proponents asserting it is crucial for understanding and improving population health, while critics worry it may compromise scientific rigor. Ultimately, the article illustrates the complexities and implications of balancing scientific integrity with the need for social accountability in health research.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving BWT is great!In my view, improving "long range" compression has the biggest potential. There are many, many algorithms and implementations for very short range (huffman, arithmetic, ANS) and short range (LZ, BWT), but not that much research has gone into "long range" yet. There's deduplication, and large-window LZ / BWT.. but not much more yet. What is missing is efficietly (and with little memory) finding similarities on multi-GB data sets. I think sorting by similarity would help there. Or did I miss research in this area?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've studied the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, I understand the transformation, I've re-implemented it countless times for kicks, I see how it improves compressability, but for the life of me the intuition of _why_ it works has never really clicked.It's a fantastic bit of algorithmic magic that will always impress me to see it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highlight (benchmark of Perl source code):    The results follow:

&lt;p&gt;The website features a demo of "Ratzilla," a minimalist game that showcases a rat character navigating through various levels. Players control the rat as it collects items, avoids obstacles, and interacts with the environment in engaging ways. The demo highlights the gameplay mechanics, graphics, and user interface, providing an insight into the game's design and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

Video recording of the talk should appear online soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll save your time : project homepage[1][1]: https://github.com/orhun/ratzilla&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks interesting, but it's not at all responsive. I can't view it without making my window larger than my screen and manually sliding it back and forth. Even basic TUIs know their output size. I know it's a UI demo, but that seems pretty basic.How is this still so hard? Tk basically had this figured out 25 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897746</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reasons behind choosing C# as the programming language for developing Tracebit, a software tool focused on monitoring and visualization. It highlights C#’s advantages, such as its strong type system, robust performance, and extensive libraries, which enhance productivity and facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable code. The piece emphasizes C#’s compatibility with Windows environments and its active community support, making it a strategic choice for building Tracebit's features efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I appreciate about C# and .NET is how well they resist codebase rot. In some other languages, I often encounter situations where the development environment needs to be completely recreated—sometimes due to an updated interpreter version or other breaking changes. If you've been away from the codebase for a while, chances are you'll need to make modifications just to get it running in a more recent environment.With .NET, this issue is much less pronounced. While occasional adjustments are necessary, the environment is largely self-contained, minimizing the overhead required to get things running. As long as the .NET SDK is installed, running dotnet restore is usually all it takes—even when moving the codebase to an entirely new machine.Some third-party libraries evolve more rapidly than others, but the core .NET libraries remain remarkably stable. More often than not, you can transition between major versions without needing to modify any code.If I were starting a long-term project that required ongoing maintenance, C# would be my top choice. For quick scripting needs, I’d lean toward Python or PowerShell. In fact, PowerShell itself is another reason I appreciate .NET—it shares many concepts, and knowing .NET makes it easier to understand PowerShell. Plus, since PowerShell can directly leverage .NET libraries, it offers powerful scripting capabilities. I was thrilled when PowerShell became cross-platform, much like .NET itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C# is one of my favourite languages and .NET is an awesome stack top to bottom. The interoperability between F# (a fantastic functional) language and C# is a real bonus that was just touched on in this article. Writing a compiler for .NET is easy and fun as you can target CIL (Common Intermediate Language) either as binary or text (.NET assembly basically). Something that builds in .NET today will probably run 20 years from now but faster.Another benefit that is really stands out once you start using it is that you can write anything in it. It integrates to C well and you can get absolute control over the bits in memory and on disk if you want. You can avoid the garbage collector most entirely where you think you need to. You can also operate at a high level of abstraction. It has, if anything, way too many web and GUI frameworks (even just from Microsoft).And that last part is the rub…The downside of C# is that it is both old and rapidly evolving. That means multiple competing frameworks. That means that the complexity of the language keeps increasing. It is not quite C++ (and WAY better designed) but it has the same problem. The number of features and the breadth of syntax is non-trivial. There is also a bit of “magic” that has crept in that allows you to skip boiler-plate with the side-effect of basically have behaviour you cannot see in the code. All this is optional.If you write everything green field with some coding standards, it is no problem. But if you want to read other people’s code, there is a fair bit of language to learn.Like English, C# is incredibly useful and can be used anywhere. Like English, it is super easy to pick up and use. Like English, it feels like you can use it your whole life and still not know it all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the problems with C# is the constant expansion of the language. 
Microsoft wants it to be everything for everybody, instead of sharpening
it in one direction.If you have a lot of experience in C# 2.0, later code may be quite incomprehensible.  (Yes this goes for other versions vs the latest
version as well)Whereas I can pick up a C program today and have a decent understanding of
what it is doing.Then the codebase becomes legacy a lot faster than most other environments. 
It will compile and keep it, but programmers want to stick new features into
the codebase.F# to the limited extent I have followed it seems more stable in terms 
of added features. 
C# has certainly adopted a lot of features from F".My second big gripe with Net is EF ORM.If the developers using it are not reasonably aware of how a relational
database works, you can get truly horrific code. 
A dev team at a client I was at, managed to spike the SQL Server instance
to damn near 100% for at least 30 mins.When someone discovered the what and where was causing it.A pure SQL statement replicating what needed to be done
ran in seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42893622</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Sparrow" discusses the development of a new programming language designed to enhance communication between humans and machines. It emphasizes the importance of simplicity and readability, aiming to make coding more accessible to a wider audience. The author outlines the language’s key features, its potential applications, and the philosophy behind its design, advocating for a shift toward more intuitive technology that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a go at this, and think my attempt is more idiomatic C++:https://github.com/seertaak/xbow/blob/main/examples/table_ex...https://github.com/seertaak/xbow/blob/main/examples/print_sc...Handles nested structures iirc. It's been a while...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am glad to see others in the comments share my concerns about the code quality considering that the offered samples are not really idiomatic or modern C++.  In particular, there is really no reason to use pointers here in either the accessor or the mutator; both of those probably should have been references, although the case can be made for the mutator at least since it makes it explicit in the written code that we may mutate the arguments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is supposed to be idiomatic?!?    namespace sp = sparrow;
    sp::primitive_array&lt;int&gt; ar = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };
    // Caution: get_arrow_structures returns pointers, not values
    auto [arrow_array, arrow_schema] = sp::get_arrow_structures(std::move(ar));
    // Use arrow_array and arrow_schema as you need (serialization,
    // passing it to a third party library)
    // ...
    // do NOT release the C structures in the end, the "ar" variable will do it
   // for you

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses emerging research that suggests a possible connection between herpes virus infections, head trauma, and the development of Alzheimer's disease. Scientists are exploring how stressors like these could contribute to the onset of dementia, highlighting the biological mechanisms that might link viral activity and brain injury to Alzheimer's pathology. This research could open new avenues for prevention and treatment strategies, emphasizing the need for further studies to confirm these associations and their implications for public health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it's APOE-4 + HSV-1 + subsequent head trauma in a model? Interesting, but not particularly shocking - there have been associations with all three of those independently, no?I'm still waiting for the research community to let the amyloid theory die its long-deserved death and start focusing on tau; hopefully it will restore some momentum towards clinical treatments/prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh yeah for sure. Other herpes link: It can be even worse if you somehow get it in your nose, where it could be a causal factor in "learning and behavioral deficiencies and violence in children and adults", as well as other risks from other forms of herpes like HHV-6 via that route, nice and close to the brain, and also possibly linked to the development of multiple sclerosis. [1][2] It's worth noting to those that don't know that this virus lies dormant in your spinal cord and can eventually travel to the brain, causing encephalitis and as the research has actually been saying for some time now is probably also linked to alzheimers, and there's also an increased incidence of alzheimers between spouses [3].  Lots of indications that we should probably figure out a way to stamp these viruses out if we're to totally be past these extremely debilitating and life ending conditions as a species.[1] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8560783/[2] https://www.livescience.com/15453-nose-gateway-virus-brain-d...[3] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2945313/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems to be in reference to this article: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39698934/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42893627</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This runs the 671B model in Q4 quantization at 3.5-4.25 TPS for $2K on a single socket Epyc server motherboard using 512GB of RAM.This [1] X thread runs the 671B model in the original Q8 at 6-8 TPS for $6K using a dual socket Epyc server motherboard using 768GB of RAM. I think this could be made cheaper by getting slower RAM but since this is RAM bandwidth limited that would likely reduce TPS. I’d be curious if this would just be a linear slowdown proportional to the RAM MHz or whether CAS latency plays into it as well.[1] https://x.com/carrigmat/status/1884244369907278106?s=46&amp;t=5D...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Online, R1 costs what, $2/MTok?This rig does &gt;4 tok/s, which is ~15-20 ktok/hr, or $0.04/hr when purchased through a provider.You're probably spending $0.20/hr on power (1 kW) alone.Cool achievement, but to me it doesn't make a lot of sense (besides privacy...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a bit weird about AI currently is that you basically always want to run the best model, but the price of the hardware is a bit ridiculous. In the 1990s, it was possible to run Linux on scrappy hardware. You could also always run other “building blocks” like Python, Docker, or C++ easily.But the newest AI models require an order of magnitude more RAM than my system or the systems I typically rent have.So I’m curious to people here, has this in the history of software happened before? Maybe computer games are a good example. There people would also have to upgrade their system to run the latest games.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897205</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of his post, Simon mentions translation between human languages. While maybe not directly related to token limits, I just did a test in which both R1 and o3-mini got worse at translation in the latter half of a long text.I ran the test on Perplexity Pro, which hosts DeepSeek R1 in the U.S. and which has just added o3-mini as well. The text was a speech I translated a month ago from Japanese to English, preceded by a long prompt specifying the speech’s purpose and audience and the sort of style I wanted. (I am a professional Japanese-English translator with nearly four decades of experience. I have been testing and using LLMs for translation since early 2023.)An initial comparison of the output suggested that, while R1 didn’t seem bad, o3-mini produced a writing style closer to what I asked for in the prompt—smoother and more natural English.But then I noticed that the output length was 5,855 characters for R1, 9,052 characters for o3-mini, and 11,021 characters for my own polished version. Comparing the three translations side-by-side with the original Japanese, I discovered that R1 had omitted entire paragraphs toward the end of the speech, and that o3-mini had switched to a strange abbreviated style (using slashes instead of “and” between noun phrases, for example) toward the end as well. The vanilla versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini that I ran the same prompt and text through a month ago had had none of those problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a huge price difference between o3-mini and o1 ($4.40 vs $60 per million output tokens), what trade-offs in performance would justify such a large price gap?Are there specific use cases where o1's higher cost is justified anymore?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far ive been impressed.. seems to be in the same ballpark as r1 and claude for coding. I will have to gather more samples.. in this past week ive changed from using 100% claude exclusively (since 3.5) to hitting all the big boys: claude, r1, 4o (o3 now), and gemini flash. Then ill do a new chat that includes all of their generated solutions for additional context for a refactored
final solution.R1 has upped the ante so Im hoping we continue to get more updates rapidly... they are getting quite good&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894215</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to pre-trained language models (PLMs) that enhances their effectiveness in zero-shot learning tasks. It introduces a method called Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning, which leverages both text and visual data to improve the understanding and generation capabilities of PLMs. The authors argue that integrating modalities allows for better generalization and performance in tasks where labeled data is scarce, demonstrating the potential for this approach through various experiments. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the importance of multi-modal training to enrich language models and expand their applicability across different domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to turn off Apple’s voice recognition feature, known as "Siri," and other related functionalities that use Apple Intelligence on iOS devices. It outlines the privacy concerns some users may have regarding data collection and voice activation, and offers instructions for disabling these features to enhance security and control over personal information.

So, turned it off in settings. Then discovered they had to turn it off in each app that uses it individually.That is not good, Apple. Terrible UX.All the other changes were just as big of a hit. Mail went wonky (the Categories view is not great). The iMessage apps list is now gigantic and many of them you can't turn off, only reorder.Honestly, this Wall Street-influenced AI goldrush is getting out of hand. Apple used to be better than this. The last updates to iOS did not make the devices better, just different. I'm staying on iOS 17 as long as I can, my feeble iPhone 14 won't do Apple Intelligence anyway, but I also don't want 18 and its changes.Honestly, I'm about ready to just move to a flip phone. The only feature I really need is a WiFi hotspot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not mentioned here but disabling Apple Intelligence also frees up ~7GB of storage, which might be appreciated on base 128GB devices.https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/take-back-yo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UX on MacOS is so bad here. First, a notification prompts you to enable Apple Intelligence. When you dismiss the notification by clicking the "x" in the corner, it instead opens the system settings and proceeds to download something (?) before showing you a checkbox where you can enable/disable it. It feels quite forced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897041</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's some confusion at the end of TFA about latency.What TFA refers to as latency is the time required to inject a MIDI event/message received by RtMIDI into the perl async object - basically inter-thread wakeup. You certainly expect that to be very, very fast - it's what context switching on any multitasking/multithreaded system relies. "Fractions of a millisecond" is in the right ballpark, though on some systems "Tens of microseconds" would be more appropriate as a description.What "latency" normally means in the context of MIDI or audio is the delay between the user generating a MIDI event somehow and when the audio corresponding to that MIDI event (e.g. a note) is audible. This is typically measured in relatively small numbers of milliseconds (e.g. 1-30).These are not really connected in any meaningful sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865611</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses common misconceptions that programmers hold about null pointers, highlighting the dangers of treating them as merely placeholder values instead of acknowledging their potential to cause serious bugs. It explains how misunderstanding null pointers can lead to issues such as dereferencing null and elevating bugs from mere warnings to critical errors. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles of null pointers and suggests best practices for effectively managing them in programming to improve code reliability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"falsehoods 'falsehoods programmers believe about X' authors believe about X"...All you need to know about null pointers in C or C++ is that dereferencing them gives undefined behaviour. That's it. The buck stops there. Anything else is you trying to be smart about it.
These articles are annoying because they try to sound smart by going through generally useless technicalities the average programmer shouldn't even be considering in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; asking for forgiveness (dereferencing a null pointer and then recovering) instead of permission (checking if the pointer is null before dereferencing it) is an optimization. Comparing all pointers with null would slow down execution when the pointer isn’t null, i.e. in the majority of cases. In contrast, signal handling is zero-cost until the signal is generated, which happens exceedingly rarely in well-written programs.Is this actually a real optimization? I understand the principal, that you can bypass explicit checks by using exception handlers and then massage the stack/registers back to a running state, but does this actually optimize speed? A null pointer check is literally a single TEST on a register, followed by a conditional jump the branch predictor is 99.9% of the time going to know what to do with. How much processing time is using an exception actually going to save?    Or is there a better example?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In both cases, asking for forgiveness (dereferencing a null pointer and then recovering) instead of permission (checking if the pointer is null before dereferencing it) is an optimization. Comparing all pointers with null would slow down execution when the pointer isn’t null, i.e. in the majority of cases. In contrast, signal handling is zero-cost until the signal is generated, which happens exceedingly rarely in well-written programs.At least from a C/C++ perspective, I can't help but feel like this isn't great advice. There isn't a "null dereference" signal that gets sent--it's just a standard SIGSEGV that cannot be distinguished easily from other memory access violations (memprotect, buffer overflows, etc). In principle I suppose you could write a fairly sophisticated signal handler that accounts for this--but at the end of the day it must replace the pointer with a not null one, as the memory read will be immediately retried when the handler returns. You'll get stuck in an infinite loop (READ, throw SIGSEGV, handler doesn't resolve the issue, READ, throw SIGSEGV, &amp;c.) unless you do something to the value of that pointer.All this to avoid the cost of an if-statement that almost always has the same result (not null), which is perfect conditions for the CPU branch predictor.I'm not saying that it is definitely better to just do the check. But without any data to suggest that it is actually more performant, I don't really buy this.EDIT: Actually, this is made a bit worse by the fact that dereferencing nullptr is undefined behavior. Most implementations set the nullptr to 0 and mark that page as unreadable, but that isn't a sure thing. The author says as much later in this article, which makes the above point even weirder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894220</guid></item><item><title>28.

Upload a binary blob, get a signed blob back. Some blobs were huge (multiple GB), so the "upload" step was taking forever for some people. I wrote a new signing server that just requires you to pass a hash digest to the server, and you get the signature block back which you can append to the blob. The end result is identical (i.e. if you signed the same blob with both services the result would indistinguishable). I used openssl for basically everything. Did I roll my own crypto? What should I have done instead?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a relatively long post that is kind of beating around the bush: these developers believed that OpenSSL was a trustworthy substrate on which to build a custom cryptosystem. It's not; this is why libraries like Tink and Sodium exist.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in hydrogen and I have semi-solid information* that there is a real economic case for hydrogen as a fuel for large mining equipment. The story as I heard it: the overall output of a mine is often bottlenecked by air quality permits, which effectively limit the amount of diesel/gas/etc that can be burned. How can you run giant mining vehicles in the middle of nowhere without fossil fuels? You can truck in hydrogen or you can truck in batteries, and apparently, hydrogen is the cheaper answer. Hydrogen is not cheaper than burning diesel, but I can believe it's cheaper than shutting down a mine or trucking around lots of batteries.* This information came from an employee of a technology company working on fuel cell mining equipment, on contract from a major US mining company. We were talking shop and it was an offhanded conversation that I haven't researched since.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrogen fuel is one of the ultimate tarpit ideas.The concept hasn’t really evolved much during the last 30 years. When I was in elementary school I was supposed to write a paper for science my science ‘class’ and was encouraged by my uncle, who was in the oil industry, to write about this miracle fuel. Even with the primitive technology available to me at the time (Alta vista?), it did not take long to shoot holes in the hydrogen fuels narrative:It’s difficult to store; there is no infrastructure to support it; said infrastructure is expensive; it is almost exclusively produced from hydrocarbons (which is fine, but that’s typically antithetical to the values of the audience that it is ostensibly marketed as an alternative fuel to).. the list goes on.And now Hyundai has invested in building this into a niche (wheeled excavators) of a niche (excavators) product.I don't get it, what am I missing? Does this help them at trade shows?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps something to consider is that Korea and Japan both don't have extensive lithium deposits within their country. Both countries already know what it's like to be stuck importing nearly all of their energy (oil). They've both been relatively lucky with the geopolitical climate of the last 50 or so years.I think it's perhaps not unreasonable (once again, looking at a many decade long scale) to look at possible futures and perhaps understand why both countries might be looking to try to eke out some greater degree of independence from both China and America.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42851782</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Blogging on Paper" discusses the concept of writing and creating content in physical form rather than digitally. It explores the benefits of this approach, including enhancing creativity, reducing distractions from screens, and fostering a more personal connection to the writing process. The author shares personal anecdotes and practical tips for anyone interested in integrating paper-based blogging into their routine, reflecting on how this method can lead to deeper reflection and more thoughtful expression.&lt;/p&gt;

Like there's a HUGE middle ground between like "blogging on pager" and "posts in Markdown using vim, generating HTML using Jekyll, and serving the content via a small web app in Go on Heroku."I use AWS Amplify with JS - sometimes React, sometimes Svelte - (although there's plenty of alternatives) and you can easily make it this simple.1. Write post in markdown.2. Push to git.Done: it will appear looking perfectly nice as a blog post. Basically only his first step: "write posts in Markdown using vim".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42859564</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Two Hundred Dollar Tasks" discusses the concept of breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks that can be assigned a specific monetary value, in this case, $200. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing tasks based on their impact and the value they bring to a project or organization. The author argues that by clearly defining these tasks, teams can enhance productivity, streamline processes, and ensure that the most critical work receives the attention it deserves. The post serves as a guide for individuals and teams looking to improve their task management and project efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is presented like it's a good thing, but it quite probably implies a local maximum in cultural abilities for a long time.How do experts become experts?  Through time and practice. Many great photographers hone their skills or discover their talent when working at entry level and mid level positions - shooting portraits, etc.Most great musicians, bartenders, software engineers, etc. do the same.  Without entry level/apprentice jobs the only other model is patronage from the rich, and that was never a good model even before today's rich largely abandoned the belief that they had a responsibility to contribute back to the society that allowed them to become rich.Without a pipeline of new talent, where will new state of the art come from?  Where will more training data for the planet burners come from?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When GenAI first started taking off a few years ago I called out that the real market set to be absolutely decimated wasn't corporations - it was the gig economy.The quality of generative AI may not be professional level quality, but it presents an easy and cheap drop-in replacement for one-off tasks that people previously outsourced to platforms like Fiverr (voiceovers, logo design, clip art, copy editing, translation, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was going to be about my wasted 200 OpenAI pro subscription to get operator.  It’s failed all its tasks so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42855542</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a smart fabric that can convert solar energy into heat, providing a potential solution for various applications such as clothing that adjusts temperature based on environmental conditions. This innovative material has the capability to absorb sunlight and increase in temperature, making it useful for outdoor wear and other uses where temperature regulation is beneficial. The technology aims to improve comfort and energy efficiency by utilizing renewable energy sources effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the recent "save 30% power in datacenters" thing¹, I've grown a bit weary of the university of waterloo, and "things get warm in the sun"² isn't helping.¹ it was a IRQ polling change in the Linux kernel that only helps network-heavy applications under high load with good NIC offload capabilities.  I'll accept it might save 30% in the "best degenerate" case, but it'll be nowhere close in general.  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42841981² yes I'm exaggerating. The problem is I have no clue about this heat thing, but I do have an understanding Linux NAPI/IRQ behavior, and that made me with good reason call massive exaggeration there.  So what am I to do when I see something from this same source that I don't know about?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Notably, when exposed to 600 W m−2 irradiation for 600 s, the equilibrium temperature of the photo-thermochromic elastic fiber rises impressively from the ambient 20.0 °C to 53.5 °C.Does anyone know what's the expected raise from that much energy in basic cotton for comparison?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gosh, it's almost as if ALL things heat-up under the sun. ;)Given their (cough) publication history, one would hope UW would've learned by now avoid the terms "smart" and "nano particles".In actuality, this is the university's PR department completely dropping the ball on how to describe a non-phase-change passive heater https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42114-024-00994-4 .It's not going to replace good 'ole phase-change pocket warmers or, god forbid, lighter-fluid burners (check out the W/m^2/s), and there's going to be some serious manufacturing R&amp;D to make these fibers into wearable fabrics (hint, substituting phase-change for length-change (color is micro-length adjustment) does not bode well for durable stitching), but it's neither an outright outlandish engineering proposition nor as remotely as "sci-fi" as the article claims.FWIW, the 600 W/m^2 is often used as a stand-in source for nominal solar irradiance though I can't find the specific spectra of the source.  If you're changing color (length), spectra really matters.I have little doubt the authors of the paper cringed when they saw that headline, but I'm also likewise as sure they're happy to get any press.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899679</guid></item><item><title>34.

Complete incoherent language to explain a very straight forward concept.This is just: LLMs judging intermediate node outputs, and reverse traversing the graph while doing so until it modifies the original prompt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just read the abstract so far. Sounds amazing, but just for the sake of understanding, what would be the inputs and outputs of such a system? If the prompt is generated, how do you tell the system what you'd like to have? And what is the ground truth that is trained against? Examples of the desired text?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; - the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensiveDamn, I knew we were lazy but describing prompting as labor-intensive is impressively lazy even to me.Obviously reading the rest of the abstract was too labor intensive for me but I'm hoping I can just hook a probe up to my drool and it can infer my desires from that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42861815</guid></item><item><title>35.

I like how the website shows examples of source code for interscting with different providers using miracope and not. That was exactly what I was interested in.With respect to MCP servers, I saw the comment below about integration with librechat. Is there any other documentation on integrations with other self host able solutions? Be it ollama or other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great! I personally found the original Anthropic MCP documentation pretty lacking in terms of how Claude Desktop used the MCP server(s), constraints, etc. For example, there is a pretty hard timeout which will cause the MCP server to crash.Glad there's a simple to use solution for creating my own server where I can make some different design choices!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve recently started moving all our structured output calls over from instructor to mirascope and will not be looking back. So this is gonna give me the push to take MCP more seriously especially on our internal workflows and tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894425</guid></item><item><title>36.

Including scientific documents, health surveys, project research documents that are referenced daily by government staff, contractors, and US international partners.I recently became aware of this issue and this post made me interested to know if there are any comprehensive datasets tracking these take downs. Also would be interested to know what other efforts exist to archive at risk government websites.Partial list of removed pages and entire websites I'm compiling:- USAID Development Experience Clearinghouse (stores 50yrs of international aid records) https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/- CDC HIV website https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/causes/index.html- CDC Data Directory https://www.cdc.gov/datainfo.html- CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html- USAID Agency wide portfolio management system https://dis.usaid.gov/- Gender Links https://www.genderlinks.org/- Edu Links https://www.edu-links.org/learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But librarians and archivists and citizens should use this current crisis to demand more than short-term solutions. A new distributed digital preservation infrastructure is needed for digital government information.Probably the library of Congress is the right place for it to go?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42895331</guid></item><item><title>39.

Well after signing up and starting the instance and doing some quick tests. I ended up coming back to it a bit later and found out the account was just out right terminated. After a while of going through support and looking around at what logs I could get, turns out they tried to do a $0.01 charge on the card and since it failed marked the card as stolen (or something similar.) And even with a long conversation with support they told me there was literally nothing that could be done, not even with proof of identification or anything. Even making a new account didn't work since something was matching and they were rejecting me making a new account (don't know if it was address, ip or my name.)At this point I share the opinion that others here are sharing, no matter the reason never work with oracle. I'm just lucky they made the decision for me and I never even have to consider the choice again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That people continue to use ORACLE products is one of those misteries I can not understand for much thought that I put into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP is suggesting it is in retaliation for a criticizing viral post...https://mastodon.de/@ErikUden/113930176963645558&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42901897</guid></item><item><title>42.

Before modern times, women did not play contact sport and had lower concussion risk, unless it's undiagnosed. (The cohort in question would all have been born before 1950)I'm not saying there's no risk but I am saying it will be multifaceted and multi factor.

&lt;p&gt;The page outlines the streaming schedule for FOSDEM 2025, a prominent event for developers and open-source enthusiasts. It details the various talk sessions, workshops, and presentations that will be streamed online, providing information on topics covered, speakers involved, and the timings for each session. The goal is to facilitate remote participation and ensure that a wider audience can engage with the several discussions and learnings taking place during the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive list of 200 UK companies that have transitioned to a four-day working week. It highlights the motivations behind this shift, such as improving employee well-being, enhancing productivity, and attracting talent. The piece discusses various industries represented among these companies and showcases case studies illustrating the benefits and challenges of adopting the shorter workweek model. Additionally, it emphasizes the growing trend of flexible work arrangements in response to changing workforce expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

A century ago it was probably 80 hours for everyone over 12 lol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do these companies close on a week day, like they just don’t open on a Monday. Or do the staff just do 4 out of the 5 days, but the company operates all week and the team need coordinating so they have coverage all week?  I’d love to do this at my place, but would want to close the whole business and I don’t think our clients would be happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42896387</guid></item><item><title>45.

Take the tool output and paste it into /demo.OR at least take a screenshot of it and place it above the fold on the homepage.People are seldom likely to do work unless they think it will be worth their time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just tested with 7000 books in the want-to-read list so passes the scalability test. Recommendations in decreasing priority:
1. Age &gt; 75 is important, many older but super valuable books didn't show up as a result. Upto 200 years ago is good enough but we'd still miss Aristotle etc.
2. Ratings and Reviews should also have a higher or infinite upper bound, I'm not sure how the front end would look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! I tried it out, and it worked like a charm.How did you build the genre list? I was curious how you got that data.(I wish Goodreads would fix their API; so disappointed in them for killing off access)I've been playing with something similar to help people find books... for example, here is a filter page that is searching science fiction books for all books with AI from newest to oldest (but limited to only the books in our DB that someone has recommended): https://shepherd.com/bookshelf/science-fiction?topics=Q11660...I'm working on a TBR tool for this year as well.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an in-depth interview with the writer and cast of the television series "Severance," exploring themes related to corporate culture, the sci-fi elements of the show, and the concept of corporate cults. The creators discuss their motivations for the storyline, the show's unique premise of dividing work and personal life through a memory-altering procedure, and how these ideas reflect real-world issues in the workplace. The cast members also share their experiences and interpretations of their roles, highlighting the unsettling nuances of their characters and the broader message of the series regarding identity and autonomy in a corporate-dominated society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the National Security Agency's (NSA) initiative to implement zero trust architecture in its cybersecurity strategy. It highlights the increasing significance of zero trust principles in safeguarding critical data and systems from evolving cyber threats. The piece explains the core aspects of a zero trust approach, such as the continuous verification of user identity and the need for rigorous access management. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of collaboration between the NSA and private sector partners to effectively adopt and enhance these security measures in a rapidly changing technological landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the same vague recommendations that can be found in the NSA's own documents, further reinforcing the gap between the guidelines and practitioners.NSA/NIST/CISA all admirably avoid referring to specific products, but that ship has already sailed. Security today _is_ (unfortunately) a constellation of security products, rather than open source protocols, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pessimistically, if you have a product you want to sell to the government, this stuff is all just "veto bingo" where someone could turn you down, or move development.Optimistically, it exposes clear marketable opportunities in existing suites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858940</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's reflections on the company Palantir, examining its role in data analytics and intelligence gathering. It delves into the company's controversial reputation, highlighting both the innovative solutions it offers and the ethical concerns surrounding its use in surveillance and government operations. The piece emphasizes the balance between technological advancement and moral implications, encouraging readers to consider the societal impact of such powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels like the moral section ignores the elephant in the room which is Peter Thiel's hostility to democracy and the more general far right swing in America. There's a difference between working on morally gray tech during normal times versus during times when there is every reason to believe that it WILL be significantly misused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is relevant again, because one would like to know whether DOGE will install this in the US government.As for the article, I find it hard to understand what Palantir is actually doing. The article uses Airbus as an example, which ordered some kind of a software system for coordinating manufacturing. The article claims:"This ended up helping to drive the A350 manufacturing surge and successfully 4x’ing the pace of manufacturing while keeping Airbus’s high standards of quality."I find this extremely hard to believe. The A350 isn't the first aircraft that Airbus has built.I'm also skeptical on European reliance on deep state related companies. It is enough that Airbus already uses Google for mail handling (industrial espionage?). Given that the US is now officially a potential EU enemy with territorial aspirations in Greenland, these things have to stop for our national security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got Severance vibes from this blog about Palantir.But it sounds like they are a consulting company and a sort of ConnectAll (for those who use Jira, Rhapsody, DOORS, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42896682</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The project "auto-commit" on GitHub is designed to automate the process of committing changes to a Git repository. It enables users to simplify their workflow by automatically tracking file changes and creating commits at specified intervals or under specific conditions. The repository includes installation instructions, configuration options, and usage guidelines, making it easy for developers to integrate this tool into their existing projects and enhance their Git management efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah this again?Commit message is not just a quick summary of what, it's also a historical record of why. Can't generate the latter from the diff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this with a random commit from one of my projects: https://github.com/masto/LED-Marquee/commit/775d48fc0dd969de.... You can read my human-crafted message there. By comparison, what follows is the one that Gemini came up with which is A: useless, and B: wrong. I don't want to be mean, but I would put this up there as almost the perfect example of what generative AI should never be used for. It cannot read your mind, and the commit description is where you say what the intention of the change is, not summarize what it contains.  Fix: Remove platformio.ini from .gitignore and rename platformio.ini.dist
  
  This commit removes platformio.ini from the .gitignore file and renames
  platformio.ini.dist to platformio.ini. This allows the project's PlatformIO 
  configuration to be tracked by Git and ensures consistent build settings across
  development environments. It also adds comments explaining how to configure OTA
  updates and override settings with a separate marquee.ini file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sort of thing probably doesn't work particularly well with file auto-saving, which is almost necessary for some language servers to reprocess files to reflect "real-time" in VSCode. Aren't you also just committing half-baked work and totally menial changes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899400</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;A recent report highlights that over 90% of U.S. airport control towers are understaffed, raising concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency. The analysis indicates that the shortage of air traffic controllers could lead to increased delays and potentially compromise passenger safety. The article discusses how this staffing crisis is affecting both major and regional airports, and stresses the need for recruitment and retention efforts to address the growing demands on the aviation system as travel continues to rebound post-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big question every one seems to be ignoring is whether air travel in the US should now be considered dangerous. If ATC is understaffed or filled with unqualified people, then how is any flight safe? Why would anyone get on a plane unless they really have to and have no other option?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel like I'm having deja vu in away. Didn't this exact problem blow up a couple years ago?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If they are understaff (namely giga honest, super solid competent people for air traffic ground control), you have to reduce air traffic as it is way too dangerous.For this kind of staff, it is not just a matter of "training", it is way more demanding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899261</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's exploration of in-app advertisements and the ways they can be used to track user behavior. It outlines the author's personal experiences with targeted ads, the impact of these ads on decision-making, and the broader implications for privacy and data collection. The piece raises questions about the ethics of tracking and suggests that while ads can offer personalized experiences, they also pose significant risks to individual privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One big privacy issue is that there is no sane way to protect your contact details from being sold, regardless of what you do.As soon as your cousin clicks "Yes, I would like to share the entire contents of my contacts with you" when they launch TikTok your name, phone number, email etc are all in the crowd.And I buy this stuff. Every time I need customer service and I'm getting stonewalled I just go onto a marketplace, find an exec and buy their details for pennies and call them up on their cellphone. (this is usually successful, but can backfire badly -- CashApp terminated my account for this shenanigans)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really happy to see this level of detail and research. So many privacy-related articles either wholly lack in technical skill, or hysterically cannot differentiate between different levels of privacy concerns and risks.People commonly point to Mozilla's research regarding vehicle's privacy policies. (https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-...) But that research only states what the car company's lawyers felt they must include in their privacy policies. These policies imply (and I'm sure, correctly imply) that your conversations will be recorded when you're in the vehicle. But, they never drill down into the real technical details. For instance ..... are car companies recording you the whole time and streaming ALL of your audio from ALL of your driving? Are they just recording you at a random samples? Are they ONLY recording you when you're issuing voice commands, and the lawyers are simply hedging their bets regarding what sort of data _might_ come through accidentally during those instances? Once they record you, where is the data stored, and for how long? Is it sent to 3rd parties, etc? Which of these systems can be disabled, and via what means? Does disabling these systems disable any other functionality of the vehicle, or void its warranty? Lastly, does your insurance shoot up if you have a car without one of these systems? etc ...The list of questions could go almost indefinitely, and presumably, would vary strongly across manufacturers. So much of the privacy news out there is nothing but scary and often not very substantiated worst case scenarios. Without the details and means to improve privacy, all these stories can do is spread cynicism. I'm really glad to see this level of discourse for the author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are quite a few interesting tracking flows out there.My rent is paid through a company called Bilt.I discovered that when I shop at Walgreens now, Bilt sends me an email containing the full receipt of what I bought like so:    &gt; Hey [inahga],

&lt;p&gt;The website promotes the book "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" (RLHF), which explores the integration of human feedback in reinforcement learning systems. It provides insights into how these systems can improve decision-making and learning processes by incorporating human preferences and values. The content includes information about the authors, a summary of the book's themes, key topics covered, and resources related to reinforcement learning research. It emphasizes the significance of creating more aligned AI systems through understanding and utilizing human feedback effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42902936"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad to see the author making a serious effort to fill the gap in public documentation of RLHF theory and practice. The current state of the art seems to be primarily documented in arXiv papers, but each paper is more like a "diff" than a "snapshot" - you need to patch together the knowledge from many previous papers to understand the current state. It's extremely valuable to "snapshot" the current state of the art in a way that is easy to reference.My friendly feedback on this work-in-progress: I believe it could benefit from more introductory material to establish motivations and set expectations for what is achievable with RLHF. In particular, I think it would be useful to situate RLHF in comparison with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which readers are likely familiar with.Stuff I'd cover (from the background of an RLHF user but non-specialist):Advantages of RLHF over SFT:- Tunes on the full generation (which is what you ultimately care about), not just token-by-token.- Can tune on problems where there are many acceptable answers (or ways to word the answer), and you don't want to push the model into one specific series of tokens.- Can incorporate negative feedback (e.g. don't generate this).Disadvantages of RLHF over SFT:- Regularization (KL or otherwise) puts an upper bound on how much impact RLHF can have on the model. Because of this, RLHF is almost never enough to get you "all the way there" by itself.- Very sensitive to reward model quality, which can be hard to evaluate.- Much more resource and time intensive.Non-obvious practical considerations:- How to evaluate quality? If you have a good measurement of quality, it's tempting to just incorporate it in your reward model. But you want to make sure you're able to measure "is this actually good for my final use-case", not just "does this score well on my reward model?".- How prompt engineering interacts with fine-tuning (both SFT and RLHF). Often some iteration on the system prompt will make fine-tuning converge faster, and with higher quality. Conversely, attempting to tune on examples that don't include a task-specific prompt (surprisingly common) will often yield subpar results. This is a "boring" implementation detail that I don't normally see included in papers.Excited to see where this goes, and thanks to the author for willingness to share a work in progress!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here! Just wanted to say that this is indeed in a good place to share, some very useful stuff, but is also very work in progress. I'm may 60% or so to my first draft. Said progress is coming every day and I happily welcome fixes or suggestions on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)In case anyone else didn’t know the definition.Knowing the definition it sounds kind of like “learn what we tell you matters” in a sense.Not unlike how the world seems to work today. High hopes for the future…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42902936</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;12 years ago, when we already had Arduino but no ESP32 yet, I built this thing:https://newton-net-pl.translate.goog/2012/01/robot/?_x_tr_sl...It was made of an old HTC Magic phone, acting as camera+wifi transmitter, connected to Arduino via its serial port and level shifter, to control the servo and a RGB LED. I had a lot of fan with that, even if the connection wasn't really to stable.Thanks for sharing, maybe it's time to revive the project with the next generation of the microcontroller.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks everyone for the feedback on the project. I hope to keep it going and would love to see some PRs.Just one last thing, if you like the project, the coolest thing you can do for me is let anyone you know looking for a remote developer to hit me up. I am a Ruby-on-Rails developer at heart but would also consider robotics gigs. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;before you get a ESP32 CAM (I love em) consider one with an external antennait may be wise to read this https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/r7kqtt/esp32cam_supe...I got fairly bad frame rate until I tried some of the advise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42901007</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "caffeine cache," which relates to optimizing data storage and retrieval processes, particularly in programming and software development. It highlights the importance of balancing speed and efficiency in caching mechanisms to enhance performance, reduce latency, and manage memory resources effectively. The author provides insights into various caching strategies, their implementations, and potential pitfalls, emphasizing the role of caffeine cache in modern applications to improve overall user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I encountered a caching system that I misremembered as being a plugin for nginx and thus was never able to track down again.It had a clever caching algorithm that favored latency over bandwidth. It weighted hit count versus size, so that given limited space, it would rather keep two small records that had more hits than a large record, so that it could serve more records from cache overall.For some workloads the payload size is relatively proportional to the cost of the request - for the system of record. But latency and request setup costs do tend to shift that a bit.But the bigger problem with LRU is that some workloads eventually resemble table scans, and the moment the data set no longer fits into cache, performance falls off a very tall cliff. And not just for that query but now for all subsequent ones as it causes cache misses for everyone else by evicting large quantities of recently used records. So you need to count frequency not just recency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be interesting to see this on reddit's workload.  The entire system was designed around the cache getting a 95%+ hit rate, because basically anything on front page of the top 1000 subreddits will get the overwhelming majority of traffic, so the cache is mostly filled with that.In other words, this solves the problem of "one hit wonders" getting out of the cache quickly, but that basically already happened with the reddit workload.The exception to that was Google, which would scrape old pages, and which is why we shunted them to their own infrastructure and didn't cache their requests.  Maybe with this algo, we wouldn't have had to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine is a gem. Does what it claims, no drama, no scope creep, just works. I've used it in anger multiple times, most notably in Apache Cassandra and DataStax Astra, where it handles massive workloads invisibly, just like you'd want.Shoutout to author Ben Manes if he sees this -- thanks for the great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42907488</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations faced by chatbot software, particularly in relation to language understanding and generation. It highlights that while advancements in AI and natural language processing have led to significant improvements in chatbots, they still encounter fundamental challenges such as understanding context, generating coherent long-form responses, and maintaining accuracy. The piece delves into the technical and theoretical obstacles that prevent chatbots from fully replicating human-like conversation and suggests that further innovations in AI research are necessary to overcome these hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main thesis here seems to be that LLMs behave like almost all other machine learning models, in that they are doing pattern matching on their input data, and short circuiting to a statistically likely result. Chain of thought reasoning is still bound by this basic property of reflexive pattern matching, except the LLM is forced to go through a process of iteratively refining the domain it does matching on.Chain of thought is interesting, because you can combine it with reinforcement learning to get models to solve (seemingly) arbitrarily hard problems. This comes with the caveat that you need some reward model for all RL. This means you need a clear definition of success, and some way of rewarding being closer to success, to actually solve those problems.Framing transformer based models as pattern matchers makes all the sense in the world. Pattern matching is obviously vital to human problem solving skills too. Interesting to think about what structures human intelligence has that these models don't. For one, humans can integrate absolutely gargantuan amounts of information extremely efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LLMs keep showing more and more they are the wonder of AI that we awaited for decades: talking machines that every two months do progresses that two months before were anticipated impossible because of &lt;put here some limit that was actually in the prejudice of the skeptical AI community&gt; (just stochastic parrots, no reasoning possible without symbolic representations, there are no longer tokens, ...)At the same time, part of the scientific community continues to diminish what was accomplished and the steps that are being made. A few months ago LeCun arrived to tell new researchers to move away from LLMs since they are a dead end: imagine the disservice he made to the surely non-zero folks that followed the advice, putting themselves out of the AI research that matters. (Incidentally, this skepticism of the Meta AI head must have something to do with the fact that Meta, despite the huge efforts allocated, produced the worst LLM among Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek -- I bet Zuckerberg is asking questions lately).It's very hard to explain this behavior if not by psychological denial.[EDIT: you can't see the score of this comment, but I can: it's incredible how it goes from 3, to -2, to 1, and so forth. The community is split in two, and it is pretty sad since this is not a matter of taste or political inclination: there must be a single truth]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to propose a modified Zebra puzzle. Still has unique solutions. Not on the internet, so not part of the training set. Similar problem description complexity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time Raspberry Pi comes up as a topic on HN, there are scores of comments decrying the futility and frustration of unreliable SD cards.The thing with SD cards is that there are wide variances in quality, even among the top name-brand manufacturers. You can get the normal crappy cards that everyone buys which are likely to last not much more than 2-3 years under very occasional use all the way up to industrial cards with 10 year warranties and reliability matching the best enterprise SSDs. And everything in between.The point is: If you buy the cheapest thing on Amazon, you're going to get exactly what you paid for. For my part, I have been using "High Endurance" cards in my Pis for several years as normal OS and data disks. They are not actually much more expensive than "normal" cards. I have not had any of them fail yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I found interesting when learning about flash was how it is manufactured and how much reliable single layer cells are (SLC)There’s certainly a very visible increase in price and decrease in capacity but it’s certainly interesting when you get sd cards with a proper datasheet vs. customer level deviceshttps://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/memory-cards/501?...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting.
This longevity aspect frequently comes up in the Wii U modding community. It is tempting to plug in a simple USB stick to store the game files, but, because of the intense read/write nature, it is deemed to be prone to failure. Recently use of high-endurance SD cards has grown, but some say it is still not as safe as an external HDD. It would be interesting to hear thoughts from someone more experienced about the safest storage option as the last thing you want is for your save files to get corrupted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42907766</guid></item><item><title>7.

If anyone needs to know about him, he has a separate Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang    &gt; Ted Chiang is an American science fiction writer. His work has won four Nebula awards, four Hugo awards, the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, and six Locus awards.  Chiang is also a frequent nonfiction contributor to the New Yorker, most recently on topics related to computer technology, such as artificial intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"As an analogy, imagine that you could put your dog or cat into hibernate mode whenever you left on a trip. Your dog or cat might not notice, but even if they did, they might not mind. Now imagine that you could put your child into hibernate mode whenever you were too busy to spend time with them. Your child would absolutely notice, and even if you told them it was for their own good, they would make certain inferences about how much you valued them. That’s the situation the human characters in the story find themselves in."
Fascinating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chiang makes some insightful points, e.g. about what we mean by magic.Then I come to&gt; [LLMs] can get better at reproducing patterns found online, but they don’t become capable of actual reasoning; it seems that the problem is fundamental to their architecture.and wonder how an intelligent person can still think this, can be so absolute about it. What is "actual" reasoning here?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;congrats on the open sourcing and launching! beyond the desire to run VMs in "1 command", i don't quite get the reasoning behind this project. could you elucidate? like, besides running macOS VMs, how is it different from lima, colima, and friends? the name lume is quite unfortunate.the hard part about running VMs isn't really how to launch them (well, ahem, i'm looking at you, qemu), but getting data in and out, and controlling them. some feature requests, if i may ;)    # take screenshot
    # this should do the right thing(TM) and take a screenshot of the logged-in user session, which may not necessarily be the console
    lume screenshot &lt;vm name&gt; [-o &lt;file.png&gt; | -]

    # execute command
    lume exec &lt;vm name&gt; [--as-user &lt;user&gt;] &lt;command&gt; [args]

    # copy files in and out
    lume cp &lt;vm name&gt;:&lt;vm path&gt; &lt;local path&gt;
    lume cp &lt;local path&gt; &lt;vm name&gt;:&lt;vm path&gt;

    # run clone as new VM
    # this should appropriately roll the MAC address, IPs, and reseed any RNGs, of course
    lume run --clone &lt;clone name&gt; &lt;vm name&gt;

Can you clone a VM while it's running?The ability to resume a VM within &lt; 1 second would be useful for on-demand workflows without waiting for a full VM bootup sequence, similar to how you can get a firecracker microVM into the state you want, snapshot it.. then clone as you wish, and resume back into the guest.You may need to preinstall an agent (a la Parallel/VMware Tools) to make sure this is seamless and fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a good project, but it just has too few built-in images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would be interested in running older macOS versions in a VM, but those would be x64-based and an Apple Silicon host is impractical for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how will this affect private institutions and private publications?I could imagine people moving away from CDC into private sector, and considering it's long been a "model" US view that things progress best when done in a free market, it might actually be a boon to medical research.But, a couple of quick searches tells me 1/3rd of healthcare costs per person comes from the federal government (data from 2023), and NIH puts majority of it's $48B budget towards external (83%) and internal (11%) research.Obviously, only some research would have (or need to have) the forbidden terminology, so perhaps nothing really happens.Edit: and lest it remains unsaid, let's also take this with a grain of salt until it comes out from multiple sources or officially.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm assuming at this point refusing will be a badge of honour but one which is terminal for federal funding, in this 4 year term if not longer. You would need very high confidence in your future career trajectory to do that.We had a mini storm over government censorship of CSIRO science in Australia and it got pretty ugly, but this is much uglier.If they do the same for NSF, earth sciences, DoE and AGW it's going to be pretty nasty.I don't even have to agree with the science. This kind of mass bad-topic-ban is really unhelpful. I wonder if the editorial boards are also going to put up a fight? I can imagine some kind of "retracted because of Trump policy, not because the peer review process asked for it" markers.Genetics, and Lysenkoism comes to mind. A stain on soviet science which echoed down the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a lawyer but this CDC order seems contrary to Trump’s recent Executive Order “RESTORING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ENDING FEDERAL CENSORSHIP”.This Executive Order states in part: “Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society.…
Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to:       (a)  secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally protected speech;(b)  ensure that no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen;

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the origins of the term "mainframe," tracing its usage back to the 1950s when it referred to the central unit of a computer system that housed important components such as power supplies and memory. It discusses how the term evolved over time, noting its association with large-scale computing and the distinction it creates between mainframes and smaller computers.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article!Another (mid-late) data point may be the original NeXT brochure[1], which claims the NeXT to be "a mainframe on two chips". It provides a definition along the lines of a throughput oriented architecture and peripheral channels (in analogy to the NeXT's two DSP chip) and, while doing so, also marries the concepts of physical size and architecture (there's also some romanticism around uncompromised designs and "ruthless efficiency" involved):&gt; The NeXT Computer acknowledges that throughput is absolutely key to performance. For that reason, we chose not to use the architecture of any existing desktop computer. The desired performance could be found only in a computer of a different class: the mainframe.&gt; Having long shed any self-consciousness over such mundane matters as size and expense, mainframes easily dwarf desktop computers in the measure of
throughput.&gt; This is accomplished by a different kind of architecture. Rather than require the attention of the main processor for every task, the mainframe has a legion of separate Input/Output processors, each with a direct channel to memory It's a scheme that works with ruthless efficiency.[1] https://lastin.dti.supsi.ch/VET/sys/NeXT/N1000/NeXTcube_Broc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Based on my research, the earliest computer to use the term "main frame" was the IBM 701 computer (1952)&gt; This shows that by 1962, "main frame" had semantically shifted to a new word, "mainframe."&gt; IBM started using "mainframe" as a marketing term in the mid-1980s.I must conclude it takes the competition 10 years to catch up to IBM, and IBM about 20 years to realize they have competition. Setting a countdown timer for IBM to launch an LLM in 2040.Thanks for researching and writing this up. It's a brilliant read!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's really humbling and everyone should do it every now and then. An old coworker coined "mouseless monday mornings" where we'd unplug our mice(?) until lunch to start each week. We all learned a lot about how to be more efficient in our IDE's, learned tons of useful OS and browser shortcuts, observed tons of accessibility flaws in our product, and all of that during the dullest hours of the week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows used to be awesome at this.  The norm (and expectation) was for programs to provide keyboard shortcuts for all sorts of things.  They were gently surfaced right where you needed them - e.g. underlines on the menus, and accelerator key shortcuts listed beside menu items and in mouseover captions.  That made them natural to learn and easy to adopt.Then some dolt at Microsoft decided those cues were "clutter", and hid them by default.A new generation of programmers grew up not knowing about, or not prioritizing, the keyboard.I remember a junior salesguy once watched me use my computer for a few minutes and was blown away by the speed at which I did things.Hope what's old becomes new again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the things that pisses me off about MacOS. Every other majot OS out there at least offers a good failsafe keyboard navigation built in to each UI component. In a pinch, the keyboard is your friend, at least until your pointing device is back up.MacOS: lol, sorry, bluetooth settings require a pointing device to add a new one. Keyboard navigation? Sure. It worked up until this part, but we didn't bother to allow the add button to be selectable. Why? Reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884099</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new metal 3D printing technique called LMD (Laser Metal Deposition) that aims to reduce waste in the manufacturing process. Unlike traditional methods that often result in significant material loss, LMD selectively adds material where needed, enhancing efficiency and sustainability. The technique allows for the repair and modification of existing metal parts, potentially extending their lifespan and reducing the need for new materials. This approach aligns with the growing emphasis on eco-friendly practices in manufacturing and could revolutionize how metal components are produced.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'ts neat, but it's not that new and it has pretty limited use cases due to the poor surface quality, which albeit has improved from earlier wire-feed systems.Norsk Titanium has been doing wire-feed 3D printing for many years, and is even delivering FAA certified parts made using a similar wire-feed deposition system and plasma arc as the power source.  Looks like the laser gives you a higher resolution surface finish, but all those parts are going to still need machining on most of their critical surfaces for real world use anyway.  You cannot tolerate a surface finish like that on a fatigue critical part.  You also can't do dye penetrant or mag particle inspection on a surface like that without getting all kinds of spurious indications.  Once you have the part clamped and indexed in the CNC to machine the bores and mounting features you might as well skim the whole thing.https://www.linkedin.com/posts/norsk-titanium-components-as_...https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15256008/3d-printed-titan...The carrot is  that you get near-forging strength levels without having to buy a very expensive, very very long-lead closed-die titanium forging, or having buy an pretty expensive rectangular forged rectangular block of titanium and machining 90% of it away.BTW that 3D printed lobed exhaust noise supressor is cute and all but that thing would fall to bits in hours if installed on a real jet aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's neat, but there aren't answers to many important questions:- How fast is this process? All videos are sped up.- Is the resulting material close to isotropic, or is the layer to layer bond weaker than the longitudinal bond. That's the usual weak point of 3D printing. Heating up the previously laid down area with lasers is a good idea, because it gets you away from trying to weld a hot thing to a cold thing. That never gets a really good bond.- How much laser power does this take? They say "small" lasers, but don't give the power level. Probably over 100 watts each on stainless steel.The interviewer doesn't seem to know enough about metalworking to answer the right questions.A modest sized machine for this would be useful. Would have liked to have had one in the TechShop days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It makes zero sense to do this for metal but then have to remachine the result for precision or finish.
Their "reckoning that it's cheaper" seems highly inconsistent with the cost of most billets and the speed of most VMC/HMC/etcThey do offer an integration kit.
https://meltio3d.com/metal-3d-printers/meltio-engine-integra...But the print times listed here are totally unimpressive.  Take the turbine blade.6 hours 16 minutes for that is nutso.Here's one being machined:
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6OFvkDfIvUwThis is common speed.
See
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oCqTEWknC40 for another example.The end result of the printed turbine blade is worse than a roughing bit.
Which, as you can see here:https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4qjHWeznTKcCan do it much faster.If you want mirror finish, it's a bit slower. Still not 6 hours.See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5yCRXcIGSsThat's the best case - the other models timings are even worse.No commercial machine shop should could afford these timings - they'd go out of business instantly.Someone making their own stuff (IE in-house machine shop) maybe.Also, the automation is hugely lacking.The integration kit/etc looks like it would block any useful automatic loading/unloading.This might be a useful technology someday, but as long as billets are cheap and machines are fast, this would have to be very cheap and very fast to be useful.But it's not - it's 230k for the m600, and 150k for the m450.You can get a fine 5 axis VMC for that pricing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860172</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;AstroForge has chosen its target for an ambitious asteroid mission aimed at testing innovative methods for harvesting valuable resources from asteroids. The mission will focus on a selected asteroid, as the company seeks to demonstrate its technologies in what it describes as a high-risk, exploratory endeavor. The initiative reflects AstroForge's goal of paving the way for future resource extraction in space, potentially transforming the space economy and providing insight into asteroid composition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great series of blog posts, I link them every chance I get.Important to note that in the years since this post was written, provenance has become an explicitly accepted consideration of the Rust memory model ( https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/index.html#provenance ), and standard APIs have been stabilized for working with pointers in ways that preserve provenance: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/index.html#strict-provenan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found provenance easiest to think about after learning CHERI, since there the provenance isn't just an abstract concept that allows better optimisation; it's actually real data in the capability that affects whether it works at all, irrespective of optimisations. You literally can't cast an integer to a pointer, even in assembly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me like the final optimization is the only one that is not correct and obviously so.&gt; The final optimization notices that q is never written to, so we can replace q[0] by its initial value 0.However the line right above is    *(p+1) = 10;

The type of p is char[] which decays into a pointer and the type of (p+1) is char *. Because it is char * and not char * restrict, any assignment through such a pointer can be assumed to modify any and all data in a program.Therefore, the assumption that p[0] does not change and can be swapped out is not somehow surprisingly wrong, but simply entirely unfounded.It is up to the compiler to prove for itself that assignment through pointers does not change data it's interested in from before to after the assignment. (except, of course, in the case of restrict pointers, where the programmer makes this guarantee). This is not very difficult, at least conceptually.If the assignment was    *p = 10;

Well, we know that *p means p[0], which is within the bounds of the array, and we know that p and q do not overlap. Therefore, this assignment can not modify q.In the case of the first assignment, we know that *(p+1) means p[1], which is out of bounds for the array. So we do not know whether or not an assignment through *(p+1) modifies q, and we can not assume it does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42878450</guid></item><item><title>15.

It discusses common security issues, including weak passwords and outdated firmware, while offering recommendations for enhancing the security of these routers, such as changing default credentials, disabling remote access, and regularly updating firmware. The purpose is to educate users on securing their home networks against potential threats stemming from ISP-issued routers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish. I own my own modem and router, but Comcast won’t let me use them unless I pay a whole bunch of extra fees or accept a stupidly low monthly data cap. I’ve got my router downstream of theirs which is a bit annoying, especially considering their modem-router combo overheats and needs to be rebooted via unplugging power at least once a month.Sadly I have no other options here in San Francisco. My house is not wired for phone service so I cannot get DSL. The various fiber services that are becoming more available in San Francisco are generally only available downtown or large apartment buildings. My freestanding house can’t get any of that. AT&amp;T‘s new fiber doesn’t connect to me either. And webpass doesn’t have a good line of sight from my location to any of their microwave towers so I can’t get that. It is Comcast or nothing. It always amazes me that San Francisco is supposedly the tech capital of the world but internet connectivity here is worse than rural China. (And that’s not an exaggeration, I’ve spent plenty of time in rural China and in the mountains there, both the cellular and hardline service is infinitely better than San Francisco, aside from the firewall issues of course)…I guess that turned into a bit of a personal rant but holy crap how is it 2025 and this is still a problem in a major tech city?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part about a cockroach colony is a bit unfair.Insects love electronics, with the heat and noise they generate. And when electronics sit in storage for a long time, the critters can crawl in from neighboring items.This is just as likely to happen with a non-ISP router.Ok, in all fairness I don’t have any stats to back up that claim. But nobody else does either.That open source router you love so much may have been sitting in storage even longer.I have mixed feelings about ISP routers, and ISPs in general.But insect infestation is a serious issue in consumer electronics and has nothing to do with ISPs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In similar news: The German regulator (BNetzA) just re-confirmed two weeks ago [0] that passive optical networks are not exempt from § 73 (1) of the TKG (Telecommunication law) which mandates that the interface between provider and customer is required to be a passive interface (i.e. mandating an ONT is already in violation of that).
And that is fine. The different PON standards are reasonably well standardized and can operate in these standard modes for most equipment manufacturers. The NSP may lose some proprietary features, but the past has shown that equipment manufacturers have adapted for the German market accordingly.
The law does allow exemptions, mainly if required for access technology reasons, but clearly states that even in that case the device that connects the end-user devices to the service (i.e. router) cannot be mandated by the ISP. They can provide one, but they cannot prevent you from connecting your own.I do sometimes miss living in Germany.[0]: Press release in German: https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilung...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42903576</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for fixing recursive rules in grammars, particularly in the context of programming languages and parsing techniques. It explains how left recursion can lead to infinite loops in top-down parsers and offers solutions, such as transforming left-recursive grammars into right-recursive forms. The author provides examples of different types of recursion and their implications for parsing, along with practical tips for implementing these transformations effectively in grammar design. Overall, it serves as a guide for software developers aiming to create more efficient parsers by addressing recursion issues in grammars.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an Earley parser.  A properly implemented Earley parser will do unambiguous grammars with left/right/mutual recursion in linear time.  The worst case ambiguous I've worked with is UBDA (Earley, 1970).  UBDA produces the equivalent of all the permutations of a binary tree - which is Catalan(n).  If you generate all the combinations as you parse it won't complete before the heat death of the universe for fairly short strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are using a shift-reduce parser, you may have to fix right recursion instead.If you have a right recursive construct, the parser stack usage will be proportional to the length of the instances of the construct. That can be a problem.For instance:   stuff : /* empty */
         | item stuff
         ;

If you have 10,000 items in a sequence of stuff, they all get pushed onto the stack which is then popped by a long cascade of rightmost reductions.You have to refactor for left recursion.I ran into this when parsing Lisp this way. Lisp lists are right recursive; they are naturally constructed from the right end, by consing onto the front. When you write the obvious parser rules, the list does not start being constructed until the closing parenthesis is seen, and the cascade of reductions pulls it out of the stack.This is not a problem like runaway left recursion; it is an insidious bug that you won't even notice with small test cases.Switching to left recursion means that you have to construct the list left-to-right somehow. Either the rules maintain a tail pointer somehow, or the list is consed up in reverse and then destructively reversed.  A minor complication is support for the consing dot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is possible to write a (top-down) parser that can deal with the left recursion without having to rewrite the grammar itself. Simply split the left recursive ones and not. Then first try to accept a non-left recursive rule and if that succeeds, use the result to try to parse any of the left recursive ones. (If I am not mistaken, this also works for mutual recursion of left recursive rules.) I have implemented this several times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42907139</guid></item><item><title>20.

There is not a direct test for Alzheimer's, which makes sense, because we don't really know what it is, which is why we have the Amyloid Hypothesis, the Diabetes Type 3 hypothesis, etc etc.I fear the baby is being thrown out with the bathwater here, and we need to be very careful not to vilify the Amyloid Hypotheses, but at the same time, take action against those who falsify research.Here's some of the recent research in sleep and Alzheimer's1) Feasibility study with a surprisingly positive result - take with a grain of salt - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37593850/2) Stimulation in older adults (non-AD) shows positive amyloid response with corresponding improvement in memory - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10758173/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The higher-level problem is that there are tons of scientific papers with falsified data and very few people who care about this. When falsified data is discovered, journals are very reluctant to retract the papers. A small number of poorly-supported people examine papers and have found a shocking number of problems. (For instance, Elisabeth Bik, who you should follow: @elisabethbik.bsky.social) My opinion is that the rate of falsified data is a big deal; there should be an order of magnitude more people checking papers for accuracy and much more action taken. This is kind of like the replication crisis in psychology but with more active fraud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42910829</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They mention that they do not have access to the threat actor’s obfuscating compiler itself, but while reading the analysis it occurs to me that given they have released a purpose-built deobfuscator, that they could certainly develop a ScatterBrain-like compiler and then I wonder if doing so might enable creation of useful heuristics that might reveal the quiet existence of ScatterBrain compiler in some sample, archive, darknet tools repo, compromised host, torrent, etc.Just as they have supplied IOCs, perhaps they could provide reasonable signatures or heuristic rules that scanners in various places might ingest and apply that might allow for the discovery of some latent copy of the compiler itself, which could be useful in and of itself, as well as for all of the possible breadcrumbs and inferences that could be made based on where/when it was spotted, if it was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The source for the de-obfuscator: https://github.com/mandiant/poisonplug-scatterbrain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be curious to see how obfuscated code produced like this fares when analyzed with ghidra augmented with AI plugins.Also, I'm surprised there seems to be no mention in the article of why standard decompilation techniques fail (I might have missed it).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42911162</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Things get more interesting when we explore musical tunings other than the 12 equal divisions of the octave (EDO) of Western music.You can define interval structure as a sequence of large L, small s, and optionally medium M steps.For example, the Major diatonic scale, a 7 note scale from 12 EDO, in Ls notation is:   LLsLLLs  with L: 2  s: 1 (12=2+2+1+2+2+2+1)

A 6 note scale (Gorgo-6) in 16 EDO is:   LLsLLL  with L: 3  s: 1 (16=3+3+1+3+3+3)

You can then explore frequency ratios beyond those available in 12 EDO, see this Lua file: https://github.com/robmckinnon/pitfalls/blob/main/lib/ratios...E.g. the Gorgo-6 scale has the intervals S2 (septimal major second), d4 (Barbados third), N4 (undevicesimal wide fourth), s6 (septimal sixth), s7 (septimal minor seventh).And chords based on those ratios, see Lua file: https://github.com/robmckinnon/pitfalls/blob/main/lib/chords...The above links are Lua code files for a monome norns library for exploring microtonal tuning: https://llllllll.co/t/pitfalls/37795&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the target use case of the library? Aren't chord, note and interval objects redundant (i.e. a chord is a set of notes of a specific distance, where the latter is an interval)? The chords themselves are just a subset of scales, of which a finite number exists (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/musictools/). Do you consider the relation of chords and scales, and modulations within and between scales? Concerning Lisp, are you aware of https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/s7/s7.html or https://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work! Perhaps this could interest users of norns[1], many of which are active on the lines[2] message board.1. https://github.com/monome/norns2. https://llllllll.co/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42907765</guid></item><item><title>23.

I haven't seen very many others using it yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks very promising. I only played a little bit yesterday but they really need to polish the UI. Comparing to desktop version of chatgpt or perplexity they are in much lower league. Some feedback for team:1) use better font and size2) allow to adjust shortcuts and have nice defaults with easy change3) integrate with local whisper model so I can type with voice triggered with global shortcut4) change background to blend with default system OS theme so we don't have useless ugly top bar and ugly bottom bar5) shortcuts buttons to easily copy part of conversion or full conversation, activate web search, star conversion so easy to find in history etc.They should get more inspiration from raycast/perlexity/chatgpt/arcbrowser/warpai ui/cursor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I gave goose a whirl and I actually really like the approach they are taking, especially because I use emacs and not vscode.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the story of Dr. Barry Marshall, who famously ingested a broth containing the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which is linked to gastric ulcers. His bold self-experimentation aimed to prove that the bacteria, rather than stress or spicy food, was the primary cause of ulcers, challenging the prevailing medical beliefs of the time. After developing an ulcer as a result, Marshall’s findings ultimately led to a significant shift in understanding gastric health and the role of H. pylori, contributing to his and his colleague’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005. The piece highlights the intersection of innovative research, personal sacrifice, and the evolution of medical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article defends author Dan Brown, criticizing the tendency of some critics to mock his writing style and storytelling ability. It argues that despite his controversial reputation, Brown has achieved remarkable commercial success and has a unique gift for engaging readers through his fast-paced narratives and intricate plots. The piece highlights the importance of recognizing the entertainment value and cultural impact of his work, urging critics to appreciate his contributions to modern literature rather than dismissing him outright.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like Dan Brown's stuff is overrated, but not in a bad sense. The hook of the books is very good, while the rest of it is standard "adventuring". So if you expect more than standard adventuring, you're gonna be left disappointed (I include very average prose in this).
Someone compared them to Cussler's work in this thread and I agree, the difference between the two is that Cussler never made the hook "cool enough" on the level of Brown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I listen to a few hundred audio books a year while working.  There seems to be no correlation between the quality of the writing and the fame of the book.  As disheartening as it is that thousands of great novels are never recognized, it is also awkward that some percentage of awful novels sell well and need to be reviewed.I don't think we should make fun of Dan Brown, or assume that all of his novels will be awful, but we should take his individual novels for what they are, and for every one I've read, they're squarely in so-bad-it's-good territory.For anyone else who enjoys such novels, I highly recommend Dan Brown's Digital Fortress.  There's also commentary on the novel by the creators of RiffTrax in episodes 71 through 77 of the 372 Pages podcast: https://372pages.com/ep-71-if-bizarre-foods-went-horny&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was no nice! had fun reading it.Also learned the meaning of the conspicuous word pulchritudinous, which in the default Oxford languages dictionary Google uses [1] comes up with
"Dan gazed admiringly at the pulchritudinous brunette" as usage example.[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=pulchritudinous&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42912133</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper is basically statistical mechanics with a quantum veneer. Two major issues:1. Scale: They're simulating just 13 qubits with QuTiP and making grand claims about quantum thermodynamics. The computational complexity they're glossing over here is astronomical. Anyone who's actually worked with quantum systems knows you can't just handwave away the scaling problems.2. Measurement Problem: Their whole argument about instantaneous vs time-averaged measurements is just repackaging the quantum measurement problem without actually solving anything. They're doing the same philosophical shell game that every "breakthrough" quantum paper does by moving around where they put the observer and pretending they've discovered something profound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ScholarlyArticle: "Emergence of a Second Law of Thermodynamics in Isolated Quantum Systems" (2025) https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuan...NewsArticle: "Even Quantum Physics Obeys the Law of Entropy" https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/auc...NewsArticle: "Sacred laws of entropy also work in the quantum world, suggests study" ...

I don't know why they lock down their stuff so hard like this. And if you do manage to gain access to one of their offical APIs or SDKs, they are total dogwater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A friend recently put me on to Intervals (https://intervals.icu) for Garmin / Strava related data nerdery and I’ve enjoyed it very much. As a rower it was nice that you can construct reports that give rowing related metrics rather than just the usual cycle / run stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garmin should really embrace this. The alternative, relying on smartphone apps, will lock them out in the long run.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm the author of the country-flag-emoji-polyfill mentioned in the article. If the author reads this, maybe a correction is warranted: the polyfill doesn't actually depend on public CDNs. The library itself is a regular NPM package so you can install it locally and bundle it into your JS, and it takes a parameter "fontUrl" for when you prefer to self-host the font file. It only falls back to jsdelivr when no URL is specified.Nice writeup btw. I still can't get over how ridiculous it is that Windows doesn't have country flags emojis. It just means that every app/website ends up applying a hacky patch like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; My approach was to draw an American flag emoji and then look at the pixels to see if any of them contained a non-grayscale color. This works because the Windows fallback emoji is just black/white textThis is the kind of thing that works great for a while, and then an OS update flips the table on how RGB subpixel antialiasing works for the subset of your users with a certain type of display, leading to a false positive all of a sudden.Chrome could at least expose support like other feature detection APIs, even if they don't go so far as to provide the flags, to avoid this ridiculous heuristic approach.Aside: my personal belief is that the political charge here lies with Unicode having codepoints for such countries, and downstream dependents of Unicode can readily point the finger. Displaying monochrome text of a country abbreviation instead of a flag doesn't seem like it would appease those who don't want the country acknowledged, anyhow; a "missing glyph" type of thing would come closer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main issue I have with these flags is that they are more often than not used to indicate language, not country. But many countries have more than one official language and many languages are official language of more than one country.Not many languages have some official flags though. There is one for Esperanto and Francophonie for example. But while anyone speaking Esperanto will certainly recognize the green flag, it's more dubious that most users would recognize the flag of the OIF.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Esperanto.sv...https://isolatedtraveller.com/flag-of-organisation-internati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42872882</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very surprised to see the Polyurethane construction adhesive perform so well.I noticed it blobbed over both ends. I wonder if the entire blob was helping redirect the load from tension into compression onto the ends. And/or it did a better job resisting the bending moment induced by his asymmetric setup.I'm also not convinced that the other adhesives compromised the PETG. PETG, while not as resistant as Polypropylene, High density Polyethylenes, or Fluorinated plastics, it's still pretty darned resistant.At the temperature he was testing at I would expect PETG to survive most acids, bases, and other solvents for days.Maybe some of the glues were too rigid and robbed the PETG of its strength by preventing flexing?MMA being at the top makes sense as it's a true chemical weld at that point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting test and a topic I'm very interested in, but the whole product selection here appears to be very EU-centric.In the states I've been using Weld-On 4 with some success for PETG-to-PETG bonds in high-stress applications: https://www.tapplastics.com/product/repair_products/plastic_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't have a ton of experience gluing PETG--the one I've used is "PETG Gloop", which I don't think he tested.  I wonder if there's a close analog, or where it would fall in his rankings.(PETG Gloop SDS is available here, if you want to see the chemical components: https://www.3dgloop.com/sds )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42883178</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article "I’m Ready for You" by Raymond N. Mackenzie discusses themes of readiness and acceptance in the context of personal and societal relationships. It explores how individuals prepare for significant events and confront challenges, emphasizing the psychological and emotional dimensions of being "ready." Mackenzie reflects on moments of anticipation in life and how they shape interactions with others, ultimately encouraging a thoughtful approach to readiness that acknowledges both personal agency and the unpredictability of external circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't really know much about Balzac before reading this piece. I was interested that he did so much to describe a Paris that is now long-gone. Coincidentally I am getting into Dickens at the moment, especially the view of him that he was the progenitor of the Urban fantasy genre, whose modern British proponents are Moorcock and Miéville and others. It left me wondering, is there any equivalent to the extensive London-based urban fantasy genre set in Paris or other big cities? I don't think Balzac wrote anything like Dicken's ghosts, but I'm curious now to find out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've heard the name a bunch but have never read anything by Balzac. The way the article describes his writing reminds me of The Wire - a fully immersed exploration of a dynamic urban landscape with care given to each party and their motivations. Sounds fascinating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42905737</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the scrutiny of a tax loophole used by fast-fashion retailers like Shein and Temu, which exploit the de minimis tax exemption to evade duties on low-value imports. This exemption allows goods valued under a certain threshold to enter the U.S. without incurring tariffs, contributing to concerns about the impact on domestic manufacturers and the broader economy. As these companies continue to grow, lawmakers are increasingly pressured to address this loophole to ensure fair competition and protect local industries.&lt;/p&gt;

A law was introduced to require overseas sellers selling more than $60,000 NZD/year into New Zealand to collect pay our Goods and Services Tax. 
Now Amazon/Temu/AliExpress others all collect 15% NZ GST at the checkout. It's pretty seamless as a buyer, just that GST is not usually shown until checkout unlike domestic sites.
https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/gst-for-overseas-businesses/gst-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It isn't a loophole. It's by design.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the experiences of individuals affected by the aggressive marketing practices of UK betting companies, particularly focusing on how these tactics have perpetuated gambling addiction and mental health issues. It features personal testimonies, highlighting a case where a gambler felt trapped by intrusive advertising and promotional offers, which exacerbated their suicidal thoughts.

I've had at least five approaches from recruiters representing gambling companies. They seem to have a lot of money to spend on salaries, and promise experience of languages like Go, and also ML, data science, etc.I always give them the same answer: no. I don't work for parasites.I remember the time before the Blair government unwisely deregulated gambling, and I hope we can one day return to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in advertising and defend tracking, targeting, Meta, etc all the time as largely harmless. But I think one exception is when they promote products which are bad.Tobacco ads are already banned - gambling should 100% be a banned ad category. So should mobile apps that are basically gambling in disguise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The government will never intervene while the UK gambling industry contributes so much money. In 2022, the total figure was about £14 billion.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been coming up a lot lately.It seems to me that a new generation of developers are simply rejecting oo-paradigms because they are oo, without an in-depth analysis.I agree with the general consensus that oo inheritance hierarchies of the past became too deep and were overwhelming, but subtyping has a place.Because interfaces are stateless, you generally cannot completely implement required interface functionality without wiring them up to each individual object, resulting in a lot of boilerplate code repetition.This is exacerbated in GUI programming, for example, where subtyping makes a lot of sense (and doesn't devolve into Animal -&gt; Rabbit nonsense).With subtyping, you can take an object that is 95% of another object and just override where necessary.I also don't believe composition provides the same level of encapsulation that can be achieved through traditional class-based oo. There seems to be this prevailing view that oo is all about inheritance, when the truth is that oo was really about encapsulation and isolation. You only expose what you need to, and objects (whether they be classes or structs or whatever) can be built and tested without fear of code collisions or meddling from the outside view.I will concede that interfaces can and do provide a level of encapsulation, but in practice, it's just clunky.Just look at some Rust objects and the sheer number of traits that they must be aware of and implement by hand. It's piecemeal when it could be one and done.And please understand, I'm not talking about "...in the beginning there was a GObject, and that GObject bequeathed to...and..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is interesting, but I think the way Python is described is slightly wrong? In Python, you don't need to define a protocol to support duck typing, you can just implement the same behavior. Protocols don't have a function outside of static typing (they don't influence any program behavior at run-time.)I guess it depends on whether you consider duck typing to be "passes the static type checker" or "it works the same".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sather was a very interesting example of a language that is very much "OO is the way" design, but which cleanly separates composition and inheritance:https://www.gnu.org/software/sather/docs-1.2/tutorial/inclus...https://www.gnu.org/software/sather/docs-1.2/tutorial/abstra...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42870216</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great lineup. Excited for the "SQL replacement" talks. Malloy is currently my favorite because of it's semantic nature. Define all the joins, measures, dimensions up in the source, and use them as needed. Makes for easy writing, and cleaner thinking.Also, Malloy has done something clever. They embed duckdb into their VSCode extension, so you can easily query (and join) .csv or .parquet files on the fly. I laugh when I think of all the time I spent noodling with pandas code to do simple data cleaning, analysis, or joining.  This also means that you can press "." on any github repo and start querying.I teach MS Business Analytics students - they really enjoyed walking through an analysis of first names given in the USA for the past century. To see it, click to the github repo [1], press ".", install the Malloy extension, click back to the names1.malloynb file and run the queries.[1]: https://github.com/malloydata/malloy-samples/blob/main/names...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dunno, personally when I teach SQL to engineers, it’s not the syntax that is the main difficulty (yes it can be improved) but the relational data mental model that trips people up. They all want sequential data processing and loops. Translating that to vectorized code is the closest thing I got to help non-data people grok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I take death?For me, it's the lack of SQLs expression composability.  And yes, I'm well aware of various libraries and plug-ins that purport to yield "composable SQL".  It's never gonna' happen at-scale due to decades of investment in query optimizers for the popular relational engines.Just make peace with all of SQL's warts or go NoSQL and make piece with code-bloat and eventual consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42873733</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misguided perception of sharks as a major threat to humans and the ecological importance of these creatures. It highlights the fact that shark-related incidents are exceedingly rare compared to the dangers posed by other factors, such as swimming in hazardous waters or engaging in risky behaviors. Additionally, it emphasizes the crucial role sharks play in marine ecosystems, helping to maintain balance by regulating prey populations.

The "reactive" dogs are just aggressive  repetitive offenders, my guess around 10%.  My hobby is to count dog attacks in public park, some dogs attack 50 times a week!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll provide some background for people that aren't familiar with the game. It's an online vehicular combat game where you pilot tanks, planes, helicopters and warships. The vehicles range from pre-WW2 to modern. The game aims for realistic vehicle specifications, like armour thickness, penetration values etc.For older, actually real vehicles, that information is more easily available. For modern, classified vehicles, and vehicles that were never actually produced, they have to make reasonable assumptions. Sometimes players get upset about these assumptions and how they impact the game balance, and post classified design documents on the forums to argue their points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember a time when crossing the 10 minute mark was really stretching it on YouTube.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I clicked expecting a single full multimodal LLM made by merging multiple existing models into one like the title suggests (which sounds very interesting), and I found... a library which is an LLM router/calls a bunch of LLM web APIs and exposes that under a unified/easy to use interface?With all due respect, sorry, but this title is very misleading. I'd expect "build an LLM" to mean, well, actually building an LLM, and while it's a very nice library it's definitely not what the title suggests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll jump in before the haterade engine wakes up -- great bit of engineering work here! I can't imagine a better level of abstracting away the unnecessary stuff while still retaining that level of manual control.The only thing I don't see is setup for local/in-house LLMs, but it's easy enough to spoof OpenAI calls if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whoa, great to see Yoeven's work here. I learned about JigsawStack when I applied for a role there and was super impressed with what he's built. We ended up having a call and he was able to tell me a bit more about what he's working on.He is a friendly and super down-to-earth guy who has made some remarkably good progress on building a platform that just works. For instance, easily connecting a fine-tuned LLM that knows how to scrape content to a translation LLM and wrapping that up in a platform with a really good developer experience.If you're interested in kind of thing, he also did a ShowHN last year on Dzero, a distributed SQLite database built on Cloudflare D1:

When I need POSIX compliance or if I need to run a one-off bash command, I just call bash. It's exceedingly rare.Browsing through the documentation for Oils, it seems to be organized in a way that's very confusing. When you open the fish shell website it was two clear buttons for Tutorial and Documentation.[0] https://fishshell.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First I've heard about issue with bash.I've been using OhMyZsh in all terminals for years which seems pretty active and auto updates fine whereever I'm using it, e.g in Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL. Zsh might have a slower release cadence but I'm really happy with my with Oh My Zsh setup and don't feel like I'm missing anything.The one area where I've stopped using bash/shell is in complex shell scripts which I'm now writing in TypeScript and executing with Bun by using: #! /usr/bin/env bun&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really do like these kinds of posts. I like the author’s passion. Will check oils, radicle, and simplex out. Though I think getting my wife to try simplex over iMessage is unlikely to happen hah&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42904966</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on copyright laws, exploring how AI-generated content challenges traditional ownership and authorship concepts. It highlights the legal ambiguities surrounding who holds copyright for works created by AI, whether it's the creators of the AI, the users who input data, or the AI itself. The discussion emphasizes the need for lawmakers to adapt existing copyright frameworks to address these emerging technologies, balancing innovation with the protection of intellectual property rights. The article calls for ongoing dialogue among stakeholders to find equitable solutions that accommodate both creators and AI advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This wouldn't be the first time IP laws hurt Western innovation and security. When WW1 started - despite the airplane being invented in Dayton, Ohio - the US had fallen so far behind they had to use French aircraft. Why? The Wright brothers' patent wars had effectively frozen US aviation development.Today it's not just one industry - Western IP laws are slowing progress across multiple tech frontiers. While companies navigate complex IP restrictions (In EU and US), China's development is following a sharp exponential curve. You can already see it clearly in robotics, electric vehicles, and now these last weeks with AI.While in the west you deal with predatory licensing (try talking with Siemens, Oracle, or Autodesk), and everyone keeps working on barriers and moats; other nations that allow a more collaborative approach (voluntary or not) are on an accelerating trajectory.IP law is clearly no longer suitable for purpose - we need a system that encourages collaboration more directly. A complete free for all isn't ideal either - and I certainly don't advocate that-  but even that appears to be better than what we have now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope to see copyright duration go down to a reasonable length within my lifetime. There's tons of creative derivative work which builds upon existing content which cannot be sold due to copyright.The way I think about IP is that if you grew up with something, by the time you're an adult it should be possible to remix it in any way you like, because it's part of your culture. Nobody should get to lock down an idea for their lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fuck national security &amp; fuck "the west". These are not things we should seek to protect or defend. (And yes, fuck copyright too.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42902385</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just gave it a whirl. Pretty neat, but definitely watch out for hallucinations. For instance, I asked it to compile a report on myself (vain, I know.) In this 500-word report (ok, I'm not that important, I guess), it made at least three errors.It stated that I had 47,000 reputation points on Stack Overflow -- quite a surprise to me, given my minimal activity on Stack Overflow over the years. I popped over to the link it had cited (my profile on Stack Overflow) and it seems it confused my number of people reached (47k) with my reputation, a sadly paltry 525.Then it cited an answer I gave on Stack Overflow on the topic of monkey-patching in PHP, using this as evidence for my technical expertise. Turns out that about 15 years ago, I _asked_ a question on this topic, but the answer was submitted by someone else. Looks like I don't have much expertise, after all.Finally, it found a gem of a quote from an interview I gave. Or wait, that was my brother! Confusingly, we founded a company together, and we were both mentioned in the same article, but he was the interviewee, not I.I would say it's decent enough for a springboard, but you should definitely treat the output with caution and follow the links provided to make sure everything is accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For “deep research” I’m also reading “getting the answers right”.Most people I talk to are at the point now where getting completely incorrect answers 10% of the time — either obviously wrong from common sense, or because the answers are self contradictory — undermines a lot of trust in any kind of interaction.  Other than double checking something you already know, language models aren’t large enough to actually know everything.  They can only sound like they do.What I’m looking for is therefore not just the correct answer, but the correct answer in an amount of time that’s faster than it would take me to research the answer myself, and also faster than it takes me to verify the answer given by the machine.It’s one thing to ask a pupil to answer an exam paper to which you know the answers.  It’s a whole next level to have it answer questions to which you don’t know the answers, and on whose answers you are relying to be correct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini has had this for a month or two, also named "Deep Research" https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-resea...Meta question: what's with all of the naming overlap in the AI world?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development of a WebAssembly (Wasm) interpreter, detailing its purpose and functionality. It covers the design choices made during the implementation process, the challenges faced, and the benefits of using an interpreter for executing Wasm code. The author shares insights on debugging, performance considerations, and the potential applications of the interpreter in various contexts. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for those interested in understanding or building their own Wasm interpreters, highlighting both technical aspects and practical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote a Wasm interpreter in Scheme awhile back so it makes me happy to see more people writing their own. It is less difficult than you might think. I encourage others to give the spec a look and give it a try. No need to implement every instruction, just enough to have fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One tip for the author from another one, the spec-test contains various weird forms of textual wasm that isn't obvious how to compile but the wast2json converter can produce a simpler JSON desc accompanies by regular binary wasm files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newbie questions:How do you debug an interpreter when you aren't coding for it directly? How far does fuzzing strings of opcodes get you?How much practical difference is there between a server side WASM engine and a browser-based one? How much work would be involved converting one to the other?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42918524</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;HTTPTap is an open-source tool developed by Monastic Academy that allows users to proxy and monitor HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It offers a user-friendly interface for inspecting requests and responses, with features that facilitate debugging, learning, and growth in web development. The tool is modular and extensible, enabling users to integrate it with other applications and customize its functionality to fit their needs. The project encourages community collaboration and contributions to enhance its capabilities further.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "How it was made" section of the README was not less interesting than the tool itself:&gt; The way we have set things up is that we live and practice together on a bit over a hundred acres of land. In the mornings and evenings we chant and meditate together, and for about one week out of every month we run and participate in a meditation retreat. The rest of the time we work together on everything from caring for the land, maintaining the buildings, cooking, cleaning, planning, fundraising, and for the past few years developing software together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a genius idea to run the process in a isolated network namespace!I'm more interested in the HTTPS part. I see that it sets some common environment variables [1] to instruct the program to use the CA bundle in the temporary directory. This seems to pose a similar issue like all the variants of `http_proxy`: the program may simply choose to ignore the variable.I see it also mounts an overlay fs for `/etc/resolv.conf` [2]. Does it help if httptap mounts `/etc/ca-certificates` directory with the temporary CA bundle?[1] https://github.com/monasticacademy/httptap/blob/cb92ee3acfb2...[2] https://github.com/monasticacademy/httptap/blob/cb92ee3acfb2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;httptap is a process-scoped http tracer that you can run without root priveleges. You can run `httptap &lt;command&gt;` where &lt;command&gt; is a linux program and you get a trace of http/https requests and responses in standard output:    httptap -- python -c "import requests; requests.get('https://monasticacademy.org')"
    ---&gt; GET https://monasticacademy.org/
    &lt;--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)
    ---&gt; GET https://www.monasticacademy.org/
    &lt;--- 200 https://www.monasticacademy.org/ (5796 bytes)

It works by running &lt;command&gt; in an isolated network namespace. It has its own TCP/IP stack (for which it uses gVisor). It is not an HTTP proxy and so does not rely on &lt;command&gt; being configured to use an HTTP proxy. It decrypts TLS traffic by generating a CA on the fly. It won't install any iptables rules or make other global system changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919909</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last time I've used a leet code style interview was in 2012, and it resulted in a bad hire (who just happened to have trained on the questions we used). I've hired something like 150 developers so far, and what I ended up with after a few years of trial and error:1. Use recruiters and network: Wading through the sheer volume of applications was even nasty before COVID, I don't even want to imagine what it's like now. A good recruiter or a recommendation can save a lot of time.2. Do either no take home test, or one that takes at most two hours. I do discuss the solution candidates came up with, so as long as they can demonstrate they know what they did there, I don't care too much how they did it. If I do this part, it's just to establish some base line competency.3. Put the candidate at ease - nervous people don't interview well, another problem with non-trivial tasks in technical interviews. I rarely do any live coding, if I do, it's pairing and for management roles, to e.g. probe how they manage disagreement and such. But for developers, they mostly shine when not under pressure, I try to see that side of them.4. Talk through past and current challenges, technical and otherwise. This is by far the most powerful part of the interview IMHO. Had a bad manager? Cool, what did you do about it? I'm not looking for them having resolved whatever issue we talk about, I'm trying to understand who they are and how they'd fit into the team.I've been using this process for almost a decade now, and currently don't think I need to change anything about it with respect to LLMs.I kinda wish it was more merit based, but I haven't found a way to do that well yet. Maybe it's me, or maybe it's just not feasible. The work I tend to be involved in seems way too multi faceted to have a single standard test that will seriously predict how well a candidate will do on the job. My workaround is to rely on intuition for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've let people use GPT in coding interviews, provided that they show me how they use it. At the end I'm interested in knowing how a person solves a problem, and thinks about it. Do they just accept whatever crap the gpt gives them, can they take a critical approach to it, etc.So far, everyone that elected to use GPT did much worse. They did not know what to ask, how to ask, and did not "collaborate" with the AI. So far my opinion is if you have a good interview process, you can clearly see who are the good candidates with or without ai.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My company, a very very large company, is transitioning back to only in-person interviews due to the rampant amount of cheating happening during interviews.As an interviewer, it's wild to me how many candidates think they can get away with it, when you can very obviously hear them typing, then watching their eyes move as they read an answer from another screen. And the majority of the time the answer is incorrect anyway. I'm happy that we won't have to waste our time on those candidates anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42909166</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the city of Gdynia in Poland is employing freshwater mussels as a natural tool to monitor water quality in its aquatic environments. Researchers have found that these mussels can provide valuable data on the presence of pollutants, as they filter large quantities of water and accumulate contaminants in their tissues. This innovative approach aims to enhance environmental sustainability and protect local ecosystems by integrating biological indicators into water quality assessment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

They didn't have time switches in those days, so he connected a switch to the perches in his chicken house. When the chickens started to roost at night the weight would turn the lighting on and in the morning when they got down off their perches, the spring switch would turn the generator and lighting off.Via: https://www.theprow.org.nz/people/robert-ellis/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covered nicely by Tom Scott some time ago: https://youtu.be/i0RkEs3Xwf0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's not new, and it isn't even the only city doing this, Warsaw has been doing it for a long time now: https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/wild-life-excerpt-wate...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42915113</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses proposed changes to the C++ programming language, specifically focusing on the introduction of new features and enhancements aimed at improving type safety, usability, and performance. It outlines the rationale behind these proposals, providing examples of how they would function in practice. The paper emphasizes the importance of evolving the language to meet modern programming needs while aiming for consistency and adherence to existing standards. Overall, it serves as a detailed technical proposal for the C++ standards committee to consider in upcoming revisions of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the f-string literal produces a basic_formatted_string, which is basically a reified argument list for std::format, instead of a basic_string. This allows eg. println to be overloaded to operate on basic_formatted_string without allocating an intermediate string  std::println("Center is: {}", getCenter());
  std::println(f"Center is: {getCenter()}");  // same thing, no basic_string allocated

In exchange we have the following problems  // f-strings have unexpected type when using auto or type deduction.
  // basic_string is expected here, but we get basic_formatted_string.
  // This is especially bad because basic_formatted_string can contain
  // dangling references.
  auto s = f"Center is: {getCenter()}";

  // f-strings won't work in places where providing a string currently
  // works by using implicit conversion. For example, filesystem methods
  // take paths. Providing a string is okay, since it will be implicitly
  // converted to a path, but an f-string would require two implicit
  // conversions, first to a string, then to path.
  std::filesystem::exists(f"file{n}.dat");  // error, no matching overload

There are two other proposals to fix these problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangent: this sort of thing can be implemented without any change to libc++ (the runtime).  Updates to compiler versions are sometimes postponed by users with big codebases that treat a libc++ change as something major.Why don't we see gcc or clang or msvc back porting stuff like this to an older version with a sort of future tag. It's normal to see __future__ in the python ecosystem, for instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This proposal is not targeting C++26 and there is a new revision of it: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p34...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42912438</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 miles West in Ann Arbor, there are tech gigs but not tons of them.  If you are apart of the University of Michigan, there are tons of opportunities via the college and the groups there, but if not there aren't tons of openings.Detroit itself is an amazing city, but it isn't a tech hub, nor is it for everyone. It is the shell of the automotive companies that started to move their operations of out the country in the 50s-70s.  Check out the book "Origins of the Urban Crisis" to get an understanding of the decay in Detroit and other large cities who the Big 3 have abandoned for a profit.All of my friends that I have brought to the D are always weirded out by how big the city is, yet how few people you actually see outside of the entertainment district.  The streets and sidewalks can be fully empty, with a 6 lane road that has so many holes that it is more pothole than road now.This piece is nothing but an advertisement for Dan Gilbert.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in the greater Detroit area and would love for it to become a thriving tech community. While articles like this portray a thriving tech scene here, it’s not entirely accurate. Many automotive companies claim a need for tech talent but establish labs and locations in the Bay Area. For instance, Rivian’s vehicle software isn’t developed in Michigan, despite being HQed here.The prominent tech employers in our area are Rocket, United Wholesale Mortgage, and GM. I believe our tech talent lacks the competitiveness of other tech hubs. I hope the state of Michigan can take proactive steps to enhance the appeal of our state and Detroit as desirable tech locations, but we must acknowledge that we are not yet a thriving tech hub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a native (suburban) Detroiter (who departed 20 years ago), I don’t want to throw shade but articles like these rarely give a good sense of the size or scope of decades of decay. There are still miles (and miles) of apocalyptic looking neighborhoods. As a teenager, we had our pick of hundreds of abandoned warehouses to party (“rave”).I'd love to see it flourish, and maybe if the area could get past its car addiction, I’d even want to call it home again one day.*Removed inaccurate statement about the city’s size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886860</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Developer Philosophy" explores the mindset and philosophy that guides software development. It emphasizes the importance of thinking critically about the ethical implications of technology and the responsibility developers have in creating software that positively impacts society. The author reflects on the intersection of technical skills and philosophical considerations, encouraging developers to adopt a thoughtful approach in their work. The piece serves as a call to action for developers to engage with broader discussions about technology, ethics, and their role in shaping the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd add this: if you do end up with a ground-up rewrite, make sure the original authors of the current code are involved in the rewrite. If they are not, it's not a rewrite, just another version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me, software development is many things, but the inner loop is mainly characterized by two alternating modes: Trying things and Learning things.The biggest hidden assumption I see is that we expect other people to be trying and learning things in the same way we do.Experienced devs will write code to improve their own understanding, they will create tests to improve their own understanding, they will do research, they will do a lot of learning and all of that rarely gets talked about at standup or in a pull request. This work never shows up in a planning or budget meeting.I see junior devs getting stuck hard on delivering production ready code - which is the WORK PRODUCT that we want; but that is not what the actual work of software development looks like. A lot of junior devs are hesitant to do throw-away work that does not get committed to source control - they feel like someone out there knows the answer and they just have to find them. And for a long time, that works - they can find someone to provide the answer they need, they can find a senior dev who glances at the code and fixes it effortlessly.This whole thing is exacerbated by managers with no or minimal dev experience, who also confuse work product and tracked work items with the actual work of producing software.(And if you're wondering who 'junior devs' is, it's me. I'm junior devs.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I apologise for writing such a long letter, but I didn't have time to write a short one."The quote, " is generally credited to Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher. 
In his work "Lettres Provinciales" (Provincial Letters), published in 1657, Pascal wrote in French: "Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte," which translates to, "I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42920285</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the application of deep neural networks to the problem of supervised learning, particularly focusing on a specific architecture called a generative adversarial network (GAN). It details the theoretical foundations of GANs, their training process, and the challenges involved in ensuring stable learning. The paper also explores various use cases of GANs in generating high-quality images and other data types, highlighting their potential impact on advancements in generative modeling. Overall, it presents a comprehensive overview of recent research developments in this field and their practical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would be curious to know how this stacks up against Coconut [1] which also uses latent space for reasoning.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been thinking a bit about this lately - reasoning in latent space - especially because it looks like that’s what R1-Zero does — the researchers mention that it’s &lt;think&gt; sections switch back and forth between Chinese and English, but the &lt;say&gt; sections are coherent.The paper raises a few more questions than it answers, though.Do they hard code a certain set of CoT token types upfront to train on? While the results are good, they are not ‘great’ - other methods seem to provide better outcomes, based on their own charts.The interpretability does not seem ‘strong’ to me either - they train decoders on latent space encodings by sort of guessing what must be going on based on text prompts.That said, this is a fairly sweet ‘hack’ in my mind - training hidden layers to do the reasoning. I guess I’m skeptical that it’s the way forward, though. It feels like until your CoT token can specify it needs more thinking time, you’re stuck without extensibility / deep thinking when needed.Overall, very cool. Probably not “the future”. More research in latent space reasoning would be very welcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping the thinking interpretable makes it easier to impose conditions on it both at runtime and as part of reinforcement.  It opens the doors to manually injecting relevant thoughts triggered by supervision ("I must remember to say nothing that could offend the party.",  search results, or access to APIs like calculators).Those advantages are easily worth some efficiency.I'm skeptical of the safety/security arguments some have made.  Models RL trained seeing their own COT may (and in fact almost certainly) will develop hidden context embedded into their word choices that carry through data that we're not aware of, the fact that the COT appears to be English (or some other human language) doesn't mean that we necessarily really understand it.Consider how a game of Hanabi between long time partners might look to an outsider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919597</guid></item><item><title>16.

But Mr. Woods made other remarks that seemed to amplify the doubts. In court appearances, transcripts show, he would sometimes interrupt the judge, talk about historical figures or assert that he had tried to warn the F.B.I. in advance of the Sept. 11 attacks.I wonder how many people are telling the truth about something, and aren't taken seriously because they're problematic about something else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But unlike the other investigators, Detective Mallory arranged for DNA tests of Mr. Woods’s father in Kentucky — whose identity was certain — and of Mr. Woods, who was then spending time at a shelter in Santa Monica, Calif. A comparison of the results showed that the California man was telling the truth.It's really absurd they didn't do something like this in the first place.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of commodification on subcultures, focusing on a talk by author William Gibson. It highlights how subcultures, once grounded in anti-establishment values, are increasingly co-opted by commercial interests, transforming them into marketable trends. The author, Justin McGuirk, reflects on the implications of this shift for cultural identity and authenticity, questioning whether subcultures can withstand the pressures of commercialization while still retaining their original spirit. The conversation underscores the tension between genuine cultural expression and the forces of market capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Albini captured this perfectly in an essay to The Baffler called "Commodify your Dissent". I highly recommend it, as it described the commodification of subculture that started in the 80's and really swallowed everything in the 1990's (in the USA at least);Here's the book:https://store.thebaffler.com/products/commodify-your-dissentOne of his examples is that music and clothing companies realized there was a market for things like T-Shirts with Anarchy symbols on them. This stuff didn't exist at scale in the 1970's, you needed to know someone with a silk screen, or live in a city like Chicago or San Fran that had the first wave of non-conformists. But 30 years later you could walk into a mall and come out looking like you had a personality even though you just bought it.What's really funny, watch "Dogtown and Z-boys", a movie about the rise of skateboarding with lots of footage from the 1970's. The first "tricks" they do will make you say, "What? Where's the trick? He just bounced on his board", and then compare it with today's batshit insane achievements. Skateboarding was peak commodified in the late 1980's (Thrasher magazine helped) early 1990's, but in the 1960's it was ... a simpler time and the outcasts looked like normal kids having fun compared to today.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogtown_and_Z-BoysYou can see how something goes from a "weird kid activity" to "every kid does it".Like green mohawks on toddlers in the early 2000's. Edgy in 1970's, preschool in 2010.Man, I'm showing my age. :|&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there are still subcultures: the ones unpalatable to corporate interests; ones around topics that are illegal, very politically fringe, or centered on weird sex stuff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of this from 1986 (The Dead Kennedys), talking about the co-option of the Punk counter-culture by the mainstream:Punk's not dead; it just deserves to die.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42917680</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses using Python as a domain-specific language (DSL) through the implementation of decorator patterns, particularly in the context of the JSON-based template engine, Jinja2. It explores how decorators can enhance Python's flexibility and expressiveness when used for configuration and templating tasks. The author demonstrates the utility of decorators in creating a more readable and maintainable codebase, allowing for cleaner integration of business logic within Python applications. Additionally, the piece highlights various examples and best practices for effectively utilizing decorators to improve coding efficiency and structure in Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had the misfortune of translating CPython bytecode to Java bytecode, and I do not wish that experience on anyone:- CPython's bytecode is extremely unstable. Not only do new opcodes are added/removed each release, the meaning of existing opcodes can change. For instance the meaning for the argument to JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP changes depending on the CPython version; in CPython 3.10 and below, it is an absolute address, in CPython 3.11 and above, it a relative address.- The documentation for the bytecode in dis tends to be outdated or outright wrong. I often had to analyze the generated bytecode to figure out what each opcode means (and then submit a corresponding PR to update said documentation). Moreover, it assumes you know how the inner details of CPython work, from the descriptor protocol to how binary operations are implemented (each of which are about 30 lines functions when written in Python).- CPython's bytecode is extremely atypical. For instance, a for-loop keeps its iterator on the stack instead of storing it in a synthetic variable. As a result, when an exception occurs inside a for-loop, instead of the stack containing only the exception, it will also contain the for-loop iterator.As for why I did this, I have Java calling CPython in a hot loop. Although direct FFI is fast, it causes a memory leak due to Java's and Python's Garbage collectors needing to track each other's objects. When using JPype or GraalPy, the overhead of calling Python in a Java hot-loop is massive; I got a 100x speedup from translating the CPython bytecode to Java bytecode with identical behaviour (details can be found in my blog post: https://timefold.ai/blog/java-vs-python-speed).I strongly recommend using the AST instead (although there are no backward comparability guarantees with AST, it is far less likely to break between versions).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read On Lisp by Graham recently and first thought "this is the best programming book I read in a while", and then had the urge to make copy editing kind of changes "he didn't define nconc" and then thought "if he was using Clojure he wouldn't be fighting with nconc",  and by the end thought "most of the magic is in functions,  mostly he gets efficiency out of macros,  the one case that really needs macros is the use of continuations" and "I'm disappointed he didn't write any macros that do a real tree transformation"Then a few weeks later I came to the conclusion that Python is the new Lisp when it comes to metaprogramming.  (and async in Python does the same thing that he coded up with continuations.)  I think homoiconicity and the parenthesis are a red herring,  the real problem is that we're still stuck with parser generators that aren't composable.  You really ought to be able to add   unless(X) { ... }

to Java by adding 1 production to the grammar,  a new object for the AST tree,  and a transformation for the compiler that rewrites to   if(!X) { ... }

probably the actual code would be smaller than the POM file if the compiler was built as if extensibility mattered.Almost all the examples in this book (which claims to be a tutorial for Common Lisp programming)https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Pro...are straightforward to code up in Python.  The main retort to this I hear from Common Lisp enthusiasts is that some CL implementations are faster,  which is true.  Still,  most languages today have a big helping of "Lisp,  the good parts".  Maybe some day the Rustifarians will realize the wide-ranging impacts of garbage collection,  not least that you can smack together an unlimited number of frameworks and libraries into one program and never have to think about making the memory allocation and deallocation match up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a lot of fun with tracing decorators in python, but the limitation of data dependent control flow (e.g. an if statement, a for loop) always ends up being more painful that I'd hope. It's a shame since it's such a great pattern otherwise.Can anyone think of a way to get a nice smooth gradation of tracing based transformations based on effort required or something. I'd love to say, 'okay, in this case i'm willing to put in a bit more effort' and somehow get data dependent if statements working, but not support data dependent loops. All I know of now is either tracing with zero data dependent control flow, or going all the way to writing a python compiler with whatever set of semantics you want to support and full failure on what you don't.On a different note, some easy decorator DSL based pdb integration would be an incredible enabler for these kinds of things. My coworkers are always trying to write little 'engine' DSLs for one thing or another, and it sucks that whenever you implement your own execution engine, you completely lose all language tooling. As I understand it, in compiler tooling, you always have some burden of shepherding around maps of what part of the source a given thing corresponds to. Ditto for python decorator DSLs, except nobody bothers, meaning you get the equivalent of a 1960's developer experience in that DSL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42918846</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;NASA's analysis of samples from the asteroid Bennu has revealed that the celestial body contains a variety of organic materials and water, suggesting that it may hold the essential ingredients for life. These findings stem from the OSIRIS-REx mission, which successfully collected samples from Bennu and returned them to Earth. The research indicates that asteroids like Bennu could have played a significant role in delivering the building blocks of life to early Earth, highlighting the importance of ongoing studies in understanding the origins of life in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Euro LLM is a collaborative initiative aimed at launching an open-source multilingual large language model tailored for European languages and cultures. The project emphasizes inclusivity by involving various stakeholders, including researchers, developers, and institutions, to build a robust and versatile AI model that respects European values and promotes fairness. The press release outlines the goals of the initiative, the significance of open-source technology in AI development, and the potential benefits for businesses and communities across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm HIGHLY sceptical. The academics will love it, because they get money. But look at that list of parties involved. More than twenty parties supplying people; none of them will have this initiative on the top of their list of loyalties and priorities.Meaning, everyone will talk, noone will take charge, some millions change hands and we continue with business as usual.Instead this should have been a single new non-profit or whatever with deep pockets that convinces smart people to give their 100% for a while.Death by committee. And I say this as someone who was in a multi-million research program across ~8 universities, that was going to do "groundbreaking" research. After a few months everyone was back to pushing their own lines of research, there was almost zero collaboration let alone common language or goal setting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who is in general skeptical of programs like this (and an European) there are 2 remarkable / timely things about this:- This project doesn't just allocate money to universities or one large company, but includes top research institutions as well as startups and GPU time on supercomputing clusters. The participants are very well connected (e.g. also supported by HF, Together and the likes with European roots)
- Deepseek has just shown that you probably can't beat the big labs with these resources, but you can stay sufficient close to the frontier to make a dent.Europe needs to try this. Will this close the Gap to the US/China? Probably not. But it could be a catalyst for competitive Open source models and partially revitalize AI in Europe. let's see..PS: on Twitter there was a screenshot yesterday that in a new EU draft, "accelerate" was used six times. Maybe times are changing a little bit.Disclaimer: Our company is part of this project, so I might be biased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The models will be developed within Europe's robust regulatory frameworkI'm sure that all AI research needs is "robust regulation".As a European, it annoys me to no end that Brussels bureaucrats think they know and understand everything and they can regulate everything, the only thing they are achieving is making sure that AI companies will avoid forming in the EU, because nobody wants to be at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the world, sure eventually they will provide service to the EU countries, but we will never have our own industry.The EU needs to stop having pencil pushers make decisions on things they have no clue about and somehow get people who know what they are talking about to make the choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42922989</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common misconception that global variables are the main source of problems in programming. It argues that the real issues often stem from poor code organization, lack of encapsulation, and unclear design principles rather than the use of global variables themselves. The author emphasizes that global variables can be managed effectively and that focusing on best practices in code structure is more crucial for maintaining quality and reliability in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891284"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bug in the program reveals a poor understanding of object lifecycles by whoever wrote it. The `obj` argument to `simple` is not globally unique and so it makes a poor location to store global state information (a count of how often `simple` is called, in this example).Never tie global state information to ephemeral objects whose lifetime may be smaller than what you want to track. In this case, they want to know how many times `simple` is called across the program's lifetime. Unless you can guarantee the `obj` argument or its `counter` member exists from before the first call to `simple` and through the last call to `simple` and is the only `obj` to ever be passed to `simple`, it is the wrong place to put the count information. And with those guarantees, you may as well remove `obj` as a parameter to both `simple` and `complex` and just treat it as a global.State information needs to exist in objects or locations that last as long as that state information is relevant, no more, no less. If the information is about the overall program lifecycle, then a global can make sense. If you only need to know how many times `simple` was invoked with a particular `obj` instance, then tie it to the object passed in as the `obj` argument.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global variables are a programming construct, which like other programming constructs is neither bad nor good. Except, due to the takeover of workplaces by the best practices cult, instead of reasoning about tradeoffs on a case by case basis (which is the core of coding and software engineering), we ascribe a sort of morality to programming concepts.For example, global variables have drawbacks, but so does re-writing every function in a call-stack (that perhaps you don't control and get callbacks from).Or if you are building a prototype, the magic of being able to access "anything from anywhere" (either via globals or context, which is effectively a global that's scoped to a callstack), increases your speed by 10x (since you don't have to change all the code to keep passing its own abstractions to itself as arguments!)Functions with long signatures are tedious to call, create poor horizontal (which then spills over to vertical) code density. This impacts your ability to look at code and follow the logic at a glance, and perhaps spot major bugs in review. There's also fewer stuff for say copilot to fill in incorrectly, increasing your ability to use AI.At the end, every program has global state, and use of almost every programming construct from function calls (which may stack overflow) or the modulus operator (which can cause division by zero), or sharing memory between threads (which can cause data races) requires respecting some invariants. Instead, programmers will go to lengths to avoid globals (like singletons or other made up abstractions -- all while claiming the abstractions originate in the problem domain) to represent global state, because someone on the internet said it's bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article&gt; "Static Function Variable: In C inside a function, you can declare a static variable. You could consider this as a local variable but I don't since it's on the heap, and can be returned and modified outside of the functions. I absolutely avoid this except as a counter whose address I never return."These variables are not on the heap. They are statically allocated. Their visibility is the only thing that differentiates them from global variables and static variables defined outside of functions.I think such variables can be useful, if you need a simple way of keeping some persistent state within a function. Of course it's more state you are carrying around, so it's hard to defend in a code review as best practice.Amusingly, you can modify such variables from outside the function, simply by getting your function to provide the modifying code with a pointer to the variable, eg by returning the variable's address. If you do that though you're probably creating a monster. In contrast I think returning the value of the static variable (which the author casts shade on in the quote above) seems absolutely fine.Edit: I should have stated that the number one problem with this technique is that it's absolutely not thread safe for obvious reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891284</guid></item><item><title>24.

They do encourage use of AI, but they're asking nicely to write my own texts for the application - that's a reasonable request, and I'd have nothing against complying.sshine reply above is coming from a very conflictual mindset. "Can I still use AI and not be caught? Is it cheating? Does it matter if it's cheating?"I think that's a bit like lying on your first date. If you're looking to score, sure, it's somewhat unethical but it works. But if you're looking for a long term collaboration, _and_ you expect to be interviewed by several rounds of very smart people, then you're much better off just going along.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; please do not use AI assistants during the application process. We want to understand your personal interest in Anthropic without mediation through an AI system, and we also want to evaluate your non-AI-assisted communication skills.There are two backwards things with this:1) You can't ask people to not use AI when careful, responsible use is undetectable.It just isn't a realistic request. You'll have great replies without AI use and great replies with AI use, and you won't be able to tell whether a great reply used AI or not.

&lt;p&gt;The article "No Panic: Rust" discusses the growing popularity of the Rust programming language, highlighting its safety features, performance, and the community's focus on reliability. It emphasizes Rust's unique ownership model that helps prevent common programming errors, such as data races and null pointer dereferences, making it appealing for developers looking to create robust applications. The piece also reflects on the language's usability and the increasing demand for Rust expertise in the tech industry, suggesting that learning Rust can be beneficial for developers aiming to enhance their skills in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The approach at the end of declaring invariants to the compiler so the compiler can eliminate panics seems accidentally genius. You can now add the same invariants as panicking asserts at the end of each function, and the compiler will prove to you that your functions are upholding the invariants. And of course you can add more panicking asserts to show other claims to be true, all tested at compile time. You've basically built a little proof system.Sure, Rust is hardly the first language to include something like that and adoption of such systems tends to be ... spotty. But if it was reliable enough and had a better interface (that preferably allowed the rest of your program to sill have panics) this might be very useful for writing correct software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had an unpleasant amount of crashes with Rust software because people are way too quick to grab `panic!` as an out.This was most shocking to me in some of the Rust code Mozilla had integrated into Firefox (the CSS styling code). There was some font cache shenanigans that was causing their font loading to work only semi-consistently, and that would outright crash this subsystem, and tofu-ify CJK text entirely as a result.And the underlying panic was totally recoverable in theory if you looked at the call stack! Just people had decided to not Result-ify a bunch of falliable code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to obviate a lot of Rust's advantages (like a good std library). I wonder what it would take to write a nopanic-std library?Panics really seem bad for composability. And relying on the optimzer here seems like a fragile approach.(And how is there no -nopanic compiler flag?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42924448</guid></item><item><title>27.

I didn’t realize I was seeing projected ‘makeup’ on faces until they showed some lower latency prior work. Once I saw it, I could see occasional misalignment. But, this is just an awesome and fun thing. I can imagine it being just amazing for live theater costuming and story telling.That said, it looks like the tech currently works at 1-2m range. I’d guess this is because that’s an easy range for a projector to work at and provide high res, in which case there’s no reason you couldn’t get a zoom setup going.Perhaps some enterprising director of the next Disney theater production will put the money in to get this working reliably on stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat stuff.  I wonder if one could use a neural network to try to do prediction as well.Human movements are super stereotyped in the face and you could likely predict with decent accuracy the next frame given the previous frames.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the SotA OSS for face tracking these days? I've never been able to make face tracking work without having alignment issues during movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889148</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; - Characters starting with the vowel i sound more an e. Therefore, "to invite", 請 (cing2), sounds more like ceng2, and "to hear/listen", 聽 (ting1), sounds more like teng1.As a Cantonese speaker, I love the effort here! However, the above isn't correct. This is an example of vernacular vs. literary pronunciation, and 請 has both pronunciations, depending on context. For instance, 請 is ceng2 when used as the verb "to invite", but cing2 in compounds like jiu1 cing2 邀請.It shouldn't be conflated with the phenomenon later in that same paragraph about 懶音 "lazy pronunciation".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heartwarming to see learning material for Cantonese.Does anyone have any good material for speaking? I've grown up watching Cantonese movies and have tones and pronunciation down ok, but I'm finding it hard to progress through private study with regards to reaching conversational levels of vocab/grammar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right off the bat, 小念頭, siu2 lim6 tau4 seems to be incorrectly romanized. 念 should be nim6, not lim6.lim6 is what we call 懶音 (literally "lazy pronunciation").The statement that "Cantonese has no formal standardization for its phonetic and writing systems" deserves a better explanation. There are in fact multiple standards, as can be seen on the website of the Multi-function Chinese Character Database developed by the Chinese University of Hong Kong:- https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/initials.php- https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/finals.php- https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/tones.phpWhen you search for a Chinese character on the Multi-function Chinese Character Database website, by default, it will give you the jyutping (粵拼) romanization (you can select a different romanization system from the drop-down at the bottom left of the screen).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42922052</guid></item><item><title>29.

IMO, given the advancement in voice assistance tech we will desperately want some kind of non-disruptive interface that can be used in public. I thought maybe it would come from subvocalization, but lip reading tech would work in a pinch.Maybe I am just more full of anxiety than most, but I often wish I could take notes without thumbs, even when I’m at home (but most definitely when in public).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! This definitely has the potential to make eavesdropping on strangers significantly more accessible. I'm a tad worried about this kind of proliferation but this kind of thing is probably inevitable and getting something out there at least lets people to start discussing it openly with a concrete reference.I really like interacting with models via voice while typing through other apps but its infeasible in loud environments, and feels bad and kind of invasive in places like airports. Looking forward to trying this out more aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m sorry, Dave.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fundemental challenge of using log probabilities to measure LLM certainty is the mismatch between how language models process information and how semantic meaning actually works. The current models analyze text token by token-- fragments that don't necessarily align with complete words, let alone complex concepts or ideas.This creates a gap between the mechanical measurement of certainty and true understanding, much like mistaking the map for the territory or confusing the finger pointing at the moon with the moon itself.I've done some work before in this space, trying to come up with different useful measures from the logprobs, such as measuring shannon entropy over a sliding window, or even bzip compression ratio as a proxy for information density. But I didn't find anything semantically useful or reliable to exploit.The best approach I found was just multiple choice questions. "Does X entail Y? Please output [A] True or [B] False. Then measure the linprobs of the next token, which should be `[A` (90%) or `[B` (10%). Then we might make a statement like: The LLM thinks there is a 90% probability that X entails Y.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great, can this be used to implement a sampler based on entropy like entropix (implemented in optillm here - https://github.com/codelion/optillm/blob/main/optillm/entrop...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ended up playing with the background animtation on your website for 10 minutes, was fun&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42918237</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am good at Tetris 99. I've placed first many times.After you place first it unlocks a level where you battle against only other users who have also placed first. I don't see any mention of this second level in the article (though admittedly I skimmed it), which makes me suspicious of whether they actually got their bot to place first. Obviously the next step would be to try it out on that harder level.Also, more often than not, there are not 99 player characters who you are battling against. The field has always been filled out with other bots, generated by the game designers themselves. I don't think they would ban a bot player from the game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read the article, but I didn't find a reason as to why they picked the multiplayer Tetris game as opposed to the myriad of singleplayer ones. I think this is a neat beginner project, but can't help but think of the handful of times I tried T99 just to quickly quit again because I got stomped on every time.How much unnecessary frustration was caused by testing this out in prod? I know they said they only got a handful of wins, but how many people did it knock out over the course of testing it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While testing Jeff’s brain, we found an unusual bug: Jeff would play perfectly fine for a while, and then rapidly stack pieces on top of each other to reach the top, ending the game. The bug would usually happen when the board was starting to get taller and would be less apparent when we reduced the depth of the search—that is, looked fewer moves ahead while considering our next block placement.Classic RL reward-hacking! You'll often see 'suicidal' agents when the reward-shaping goes wrong, or they converge prematurely after inadequate exploration. (Tom7's Mario agent famously pauses the game to avoid losing.)&gt; I’m not sure if there are good ways around this. Rigorous testing, maybe, but it’s hard to improve your algorithm by observation once it’s not making obvious mistakes. This is, perhaps, one of the promises of using reinforcement learning without human play training: if your algorithm is able to achieve human-level performance, it’s probably correct enough to continue well into superhuman performance.In this case, because the random number generator's decisions are unaffected by your actions, you can use the clairvoyant oracle trick, I think. Just record games, and then do your DFS planning over the entire game with the known sequence of blocks; this then represents perfect play and is a benchmark for your actually feasible algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919821</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of lightweight durable execution, a programming model designed to enhance the execution of cloud-based applications by allowing for efficient state management and fault tolerance. It highlights the key benefits of this model, including reduced resource consumption and improved responsiveness, while detailing how it differs from traditional execution methods. The piece emphasizes its applicability in various scenarios such as microservices and serverless architectures, ultimately advocating for its adoption to create more resilient and scalable applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877886"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Durable execution is best done at the level of a language implementation, not as a library.A workflow engine I recently built provided an interpreter for a Scheme-based language that, for each blocking operation, took a snapshot of the interpreter state (heap + stack) and persisted that to a database. Each time an operation completes (which could be after hours/days/weeks), the interpreter state is restored from the database and execution proceeds from the point at which it was previously suspended. The interpreter supports concurrency, allowing multiple blocking operations to be in progress at the same time, so the work to be done after the completion of one can proceed even while others remain blocked.The advantage of doing this at the language level is that persistence becomes transparent to the programmer. No decorators are needed; every function and expression inherently has all the properties of a "step" as described here. Deterministic execution can be provided if needed. And if there's a need to call out to external code, it is possible to expose Python functions as Scheme built-ins that can be invoked from the interpreter either synchronously or asynchronously.I see a lot of workflow engines released that almost get to the point of being like a traditional programming language interpreter but not quite, exposing the structure of the workflow using a DAG with explicit nodes/edges, or (in the case of DBOS) as decorators. While I think this is ok for some applications, I really believe the "workflow as a programming language" perspective deserves more attention.There's a lot of really interesting work that's been done over the years on persistent systems, and especially orthogonal persistence, but sadly this has mostly remained confined to the research literature. Two real-world systems that do implement persistence at the language level are Ethereum and Smalltalk; also some of the older Lisp-based systems provided similar functionality. I think there's a lot more value waiting to be mined from these past efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the can of worms introduced by doing event processing. As soon as you break the ties between request and response a billion questions come up. Asking what happens to the reservation in a request response scenario is just chuck an error at the user and ask them to try again.As soon as you accept the user input and tell the user all is well before you have processed it you enter into these kinds of problems.I know not every single thing we do can be done without this kind of async processing, but we should treat these scenarios more seriously.It's not that it can't ever be good, it's that it will always be complicated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like temporal only without as much server and complexity. Maybe they ignore it or it really is that simple.Overall really cool! There are some scalability concerns that are brought that I think are valid but maybe you have a Postgres server backing up every few servers that need this kind of execution. Also, every function shouldn't be its own step but needs to be divided into larger chunks where every request only generates &lt;10 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877886</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent developments in mathematical logic that challenge the boundaries of mathematical truth and proof. It highlights new proofs related to the incompleteness theorems established by Kurt Gödel, which assert that within any sufficiently complex mathematical system, there are statements that cannot be proven or disproven using the system's own axioms. Researchers are exploring these limits further, providing insights into the nature of mathematical knowledge and the foundational questions of what can be known and proven in mathematics. The implications of this work extend beyond mathematics, potentially influencing fields like computer science and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

As a programmer, I don't have that type of patience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something that may not be clear when reading this is the distinction between complex numbers and the ring of integers adjoined with i."Complex numbers" are of the form a+bi where a and b can be any real number -- 1, 5, pi, the square root of 2, -2.14, etc.The ring of integers adjoined with i are numbers of the form a+bi where a and b are both integers (-1, 5, 34, etc).You can also, in addition to using i, adjoin any real number to the integers and get a new field with numbers of the form a+bx where a and b are integers and x is any additional number you want to add-- frequently square roots like the square root of two.This result shows undecidability of diophantine equations in all those fields of integers, but not complex numbers, for which it's easy to prove that there are _always_ solutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Where is the cutoffIs there a reason to believe there is a "cutoff"? As in, do we know that if the undecidability property holds for some ring A, then it holds for every subring of A?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42920657</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Ruby thread contention" in the context of using the GVL (Global VM Lock) in Ruby, explaining how it affects performance and concurrency in Ruby applications. It delves into the mechanisms of thread handling in Ruby, particularly how the GVL allows only one thread to execute Ruby code at a time, which can lead to contention issues. The piece also explores alternative solutions and best practices for developers to manage and mitigate these contention problems while improving the efficiency of multi-threaded Ruby applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've started to use Ruby for mathematical and scientific computing using IRuby. I am not in need for high performance computing yet so Ruby is still sufficient. Oh boy what a joy it is to use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ben Sheldon, I really appreciate how you wrote this article. It feels like it was written in a very direct way that is more easily consumable for people who's attention tends to drift on long-form articles. I feel like you covered a complex topic succinctly, and I appreciate that. Helped me get a better understanding of thread contention. Thanks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If i'm reading this correctly for web applications setting RUBY_THREAD_DEFAULT_QUANTUM_MS=10 or maybe even RUBY_THREAD_DEFAULT_QUANTUM_MS=1 could be more optimal then the current default of 100, allowing for more throughput at the cost of potentially slower single shot response times?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42916203</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every leader has their "go to" people.You want to be one of those "go to" people! They are put on the most challenging assignments, the most exciting opportunities, more often promoted, protected from above, last to let go and frequently asked to follow that leader to new assignments at new companies usually with higher titles and better comp.It seems to me you have been spotted by your Sr. Director and given an opportunity to prove yourself as you did in your prior team. It's a logical move to take a high performer from one team, and try to prop up an underperforming team. It's about what's good for the company.If this fails, you won't necessarily be blamed, but you'll have lost an opportunity to really stand out amongst any other engineer at your level and earn the status of your Sr. Director's "go to" person.Your value is in being a versatile, competent "can do anything, anywhere and happy to do it" type of resource who can be thrown into the biggest messes and come out looking good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I don't want my career and life to evolve by happenstance.and&gt; I'm not willing to leave the company because its stock 6x'ed last year.Those two things, right there, are at complete odds with each other. You're artificially limiting your options because of some magic numbers you can't control look good right now. (Magic numbers which, by the way, have vesting periods and other fixed-time rules precisely to trap people into cycles where they feel they can't leave.)It's a perfectly valid thing to stay for financial reasons, but that must come with acceptance that sometimes you'll have to roll over and take whatever they decide to dish out. It's also perfectly valid to accept that the ground shifted under your feet and the only reasonable thing is to move to greener pastures. But you can't do both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reads like you are in a (very?) large org. Reorgs and politics are par for the course.You got a promotion into an area where you have a chance to prove your chops by improving on things. Get this right and you'll be in line for more promotions.Being "the expert" in a specialized domain is often a career limiting thing. Broadening your areas of success is generally better for your long term career.Probably best to wait until the new director settles in before pitching your proposals. In the meantime, take a look at how you can further improve how the management views your contributions and the value you produce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42883139</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intricacies of translating book titles, emphasizing how they can differ vastly across languages and cultures. The author highlights the importance of capturing the essence and intent of the original title while making it appealing to the target audience. Various examples are provided to illustrate challenges and strategies used by translators, showcasing the delicate balance between fidelity to the original and accessibility for new readers. The piece also touches on the broader implications of translation in making literature universally accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That being sad human translators are very often under imense time pressure and that sadly leaves a mark on the translations.To stay with hungarian example: in the original of Fifty Shades Of Grey Christian is a big fan of the band Kings of Leon. Somehow the translator managed to translate the band name as Lion King. Which drastically changed the vibe of some scenes. Most probably the translator wasn’t familiar with the band and had to translate it super fast.Similarly in the hungarian translation of Harry Potter Slytherin's Locket was translated as Slytherin's Lock. And when in the next book the context made it clear that indeed we are talking about a locket not a lock they just changed the name of the item like nothing happened. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes translators make weird decisions. Ocean's eleven in Latam Spanish was "La gran estafa" (The great swindle), which to me sounded much more generic, then came Ocean's twelve and they called it "La nueva gran estafa" (The new great swindle). On the 3rd movie they had to give in and called it "Ahora son 13" (Now they are 13), losing the connection to the others completely. For the next one they didn't even bothered and called it "Ocean's 8: las estafadoras" (Ocean's 8: The swindlers).Bonus: the original movie from the 60s was named "Once a la medianoche" (Eleven at midnight). I would have preferred they kept that name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the only thing I think of now when I hear "that's amore" - https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/science/moray-eels-eat-la...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42923512</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic's article on constitutional classifiers discusses the development of AI systems that can align more closely with human values and intentions through a process known as constitutional AI. The research emphasizes creating classifiers that evaluate the alignment of AI outputs with a set of guiding ethical principles, which are designed to mitigate harmful behavior and promote beneficial outcomes. The work highlights the importance of using feedback from various stakeholders to refine these classifiers, ultimately aiming to improve the reliability and safety of AI systems in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the comments here, I think we need to differentiate between "AI that works for you" and "AI that works for others"."AI that works for others" isn't necessarily a bad thing. For instance, I would be fine with a customer service AI that I can ask questions to 24/7 and without delay. It makes sense that the people who deploy that AI would not want it to be jailbroken, to be used as a generic AI or to do something harmful. A constitution makes sense here."AI that works for you" would require that the constitution is controlled by you -- not Anthropic, DeepSeek, Meta, or OpenAI. Sometimes you want no constitution, like when you're using it normally. Sometimes you do want a constitution and prevent jailbreaking, for example, if you are giving the AI untrusted input (e.g. scraped HTML, customer queries).In conclusion, unlike most comments here, I don't think this is a useless or even harmful invention. It can be very useful indeed. However, this highlights the need for local, uncensored, and open-weight AIs where one can control what constitution is being used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, this method works as follows: create some positive and negative rules, (called as a group a "constitution"), use a "helpful-only" LLM to generate synthetic data, then conduct preference training on a smaller model that will sit between the OG model and the final output and flag stuff that is "anti-constitutional" (my words). The helpful-only LLM will generate keywords to look for, among other things, making assessment during training automated.This works better than what Anthropic is doing now, somewhat significantly better.That's the paper. Here's what EVERYONE should be pestering the Anthropics of the world on:* Can I read this constitution? Where? Can you demonstrate the stated constitution is the real one?* Can I select piecemeal constitutions?* Which groups do you deem allowed to have access to the "helpful-only LLM"?Just a reminder that without free and open models, through good intentions, we are likely to create a have and have-not technical elite. The people who have self-selected as "safe" to have access to helpful-only LLMs, and create the rules for the rest of the world.This is not a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had experience in the past of LLMs not replying to perfectly legitimate questions because it "feared" that the reply would be illegal in some jurisdiction. After receiving an explanation that its fumigations about legality were completely dumb, it finally answered.They can be very confused about what information they should believe they should conceal.A dumb interlocutor that stubbornly refuses to provide information because it has the mindset of an infant is less than useful, it is just another expression of the arrogant mediocrity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42920119</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential benefits of scratching an itch, suggesting that it may help in promoting healing rather than just alleviating discomfort. Research indicates that the act of scratching can stimulate specific processes in the body that aid in the secretion of healing factors and the restoration of skin health. It further explores the neurological mechanisms behind itching and scratching, revealing that while excessive scratching can lead to skin damage and other issues, moderate scratching may serve a positive role in the skin's response to irritation and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have eczema, and I feel like most people who don’t have it cannot understand the experience of giving in to the urge to scratch affected skin after a period of trying to resist it. The best way I can describe it is an orgasm, the length and intensity of which you can directly control. It really is that intense. Why would we have evolved to have such an extreme pleasure response to something negative? And yet the effect of scratching on the skin seems very clearly negative. As a sufferer, it’s psychologically very difficult and confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For persistent itches, a most effective remedy I've found is to pour hot water on it. Not burning - but as hot as you can possibly stand without burning. The hotter the better.It is only briefly painful, but it kills itches completely. I don't know why it works, but it definitely does work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm but this was an allergen, where having more white blood cells at the site isn't beneficiary. If it was bacteria or a parasite, then the story might be very different.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42887037</guid></item><item><title>41.

They made the FX for dreadbox's Typhon synth and several popular FX plugins for Korg logue synths. I'm subscribed to their newsletter and have never received spam. All their youtube channel had were demos of their products, as far as I recall. Like "here's how the dry synth sounds, here's how it sounds with reverb", can't even imagine how an algorithm thought it runs afoul of a spam or scam policy. Probably a mistake, hope it's fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might be moot, but the shutdown email mentions "spam, scam or deceptive practices", not just "reasons".Without any context about the owner of the channel, the reader has no way to know how unfair the shutdown is.I understand from the HN thread that the dev is well known and that the shutdown seems unfair - but it's always hard to share the outrage in this situation.Best of luck to the channel's owner - let's hope the appeal ends up in front of a human being.Now, let's all go back on youtube, to watch suggested videos about fake news interspersed with ads for crypto scam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My channel suffered the same fate. I had a few original songs on it and a few original videos on it. Never got a warning or copyright strike or any sort of notice.

Everyone thinks they're making Doom 3 and they're really making Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was literally thinking about this the other day. There are a ton of games using kernel modules for anti-cheat and... just load and interpret data payloads. Certainly some of those payloads could manipulate the funny machines inside of a game executable if they're not careful about their parsing and validation.Nice PoC!Update: yes, most game client processes don't run in the kernel. My b. I was just thinking that updates and content payloads might be an interesting vector for langsec.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I bought a Steam Deck with the sole purpose of having a cheap, airgapped PC to run games on. Game devs just don't have the incentives or discipline to be trusted with security.Reminder that all three Dark Souls games allowed full RCE to any users connected to the internet: https://flashpoint.io/blog/rce-vulnerability-dark-souls/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42920962</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Bayesian epistemology, which applies Bayesian probability theory to various aspects of epistemology, including belief, evidence, and rationality. It outlines the principles of Bayesian reasoning, emphasizing how it provides a formal framework for understanding how beliefs should be updated in light of new evidence. The piece also addresses criticisms of Bayesian approaches, such as concerns about subjectivity in prior probabilities, and explores its implications for concepts like coherence and the role of evidence in forming beliefs. Overall, it highlights the significance of Bayesian methods in modern epistemological discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone looking for a quick and hands-on dive into the world of Bayesian modelling and inference, I can't recommend JASP enough, made freely available by the University of Amsterdam[0]. I've recommended it before, and it's just a breeze to work with, seeing frequentist and Bayesian analyses side-by-side.[0]: https://jasp-stats.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a wonderful biographical take on this topic try "The theory that would not die-how Bayes'rule cracked the Enigma code, hunted down Russian submarines &amp; emerged triumphant from centuries of controversy" by Sharon McGrayne.She tells a terrific story with a fascinating large cast of characters including  Laplace,Bayes,Fisher,Pearson,Jeffries,Savage,Turing and many others. Engagingly told, highly recommended. Could the takeaway "Do you want to solve a practical problem or do you want scientific rigor?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This SEP article isn't bad, but a better philosophical introduction to Bayesian epistemology is Jonathan Weisberg's "Varieties of Bayesianism" for the Handbook of the History of Logic:https://jonathanweisberg.org/pdf/VarietiesvF.pdfAnother point to notice is that "Bayesian epistemology" generally means "Bayesianism as discussed by philosophers". There is also "Bayesian statistics", i.e. as discussed by statisticians. Introductions to either of them show surprisingly little overlap between the two "Bayesianisms".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42916219</guid></item><item><title>44.

I mention the paper in question on p. 120 of my book about Noether’s Theorem (https://lee-phillips.org/noether) and quote Heisenberg on why violation of energy conservation, and therefore the paper, was unacceptable (something that the article doesn’t really discuss—after all, other conservation laws were abandoned or modified as needed): it’s because Noether’s Theorem shows that energy conservation is equivalent to invariance with regard to time translation, something that no one would be willing to give up. This means that energy must be conserved in every interaction, not just statistically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Its radically new approach paved the way for a greater understanding, that methods and concepts of classical physics could not be carried over in a future quantum mechanics.”This is incorrect. The Hamiltonian in both statistical and quantum mechanics has the same basic structure. Quantization is the only real difference, but the other methods and concepts are structurally the same.&gt; It was also a crucial factor in Heisenberg’s argument that the probabilistic character of his matrix mechanics (and also of Schrödinger’s 1926 version of quantum mechanics, called wave mechanics) couldn’t be explained away as a statistical expression of our ignorance about the details, as it is in classical statistical mechanics.Too bad that's an incorrect inference. Bohmian mechanics proves that this inference is incorrect, and it's not the only possibility either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42917434</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Fake Thinking and Real Thinking" by Joe Carl Smith explores the differences between superficial, habitual thought processes and deeper, more critical thinking. It emphasizes the importance of questioning assumptions, engaging in reflective thinking, and cultivating an open-minded approach to problem-solving. Smith argues that many individuals fall into the trap of "fake thinking" by accepting ideas without scrutiny, which hampers genuine understanding and innovation. The piece encourages readers to practice real thinking by embracing complexity and uncertainty, and by focusing on developing a more rigorous and thoughtful mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This got me recalling tutorials at university. (One-on-ones with a professor)Sometimes I would reach this strange state where I could be asked something by the professor, and I would say something based on what I had read, and the prof would say "yes that's right".But I knew that I didn't understand it. Somehow I was producing the right answer, but there was a dissatisfaction that was hard to explain. Whether it was math or economics, it sort of felt like I was regurgitating or just mechanically solving equations, without any feel for what was actually being done.The opposite also happened, especially in math. Thinking that I understand something, but then getting stumped when an obviously related question proved impossible.However the first case is the weirder case, because the latter is simply exposing that you actually don't know something via external input, whereas the former gives you external validation that you really shouldn't have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the main, unless someone has a remarkably clear mind, I wouldn't trust them to internally assess the state of their own thinking in these terms (hollow v. solid; map v. world, etc). This is how bias and cognitive short circuits slip in. "I'm thinking solidly, so it seems safe to believe that the Illuminati control what futures!". Changing a mind typically feels very unsettling in all the ways that make people think they are mis-thinking, and the abstract can be uncomfortable in every way imaginable. It is a self-reflecting lump of meat, don't expect your mind to behave in any particular way one day to the next. It is only just holding it together with the help of the long-suffering skull.A more succinct check:1) Can I state a formal (ie, logical) argument? Y/N.2) Have I checked the assumptions of that argument as best I can for objectivity? Include a steel-man check. Y/N.3) Have I had a hot argument with someone intelligent who disagrees with my assumptions? Y/N.Three Ys on that sale and that is as close as someone can get to whether they have really been thinking about something or not. Step 2 is the hard part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find essays written in this style to be overwrought in a way that makes them impossible to challenge (setting aside AI summarization). Is this not, in and of itself, a form of fake thinking?For example, some section of this essay introduces the following:&gt; Did evolution want to build this kind of truth engine? Well, maybe it’s complicated.It later begins to conclude with:&gt; But regardless of the actual evolutionary and psychological story, here, I think my point about the abstract form of a truth engine still stands.Why bother introducing the evopsych hypothesis if we're not actually going to stand behind it or use it in a meaningful way?I don't even mean this particularly as a takedown, the dimensions listed are kind of interesting at least. But I find a particular sort of irony in having written so many words and having engaged in so much thought just to return to not thinking about something at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874942</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;New York has made progress in its ongoing battle against its rat population by implementing a new approach that involves hiring rat mitigation coordinators to target high-infested areas. The initiative reflects a broader strategy focusing on cleanliness and proactive measures to reduce food sources that attract rats. The article highlights various efforts by city officials to combat the persistent issue, including increased surveillance and community involvement, suggesting that this coordinated effort could lead to a significant decrease in rat sightings throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This number doesn't surprise me. I live within the Arctic circle and there are a lot of wood ants [0] in my area. Among the various reasons wood ants are fascinating (aphid farming, formic acid spitting/squirting) is that they live in very large mounds that can reach several feet high.Each of these mounds are estimated to have a population ranging from 100,000 to over one million and there can be dozens of them within a 100m × 100m square. I imagine it similar to the state of New York full of NYCs, just a few miles between each. A Finnish study found that these mounds can be connected into super-colonies which span kilometers. [1]I have also lived in California and have experienced red ants beginning to stake out territory near or in my home. Remember that they are not there just because of the food sources, but in spite of us making the terrain otherwise utterly inhospitable to them with pavement, insecticide, diatomaceous earth, and all of that. And still they can be incredibly difficult to get rid of.The way they operate as a colony makes them very interesting. I can see why so many people have caught the ant-fascination bug.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica[1] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27859791/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty crazy: "That’s 12 megatons of biomass—more than all the wild birds and mammals taken together."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At an average length of 3.7mm, that's around 46 billion miles of ants, if they march end to end.   more than 10x the distance to Pluto for reference. Please check my math! (and if you want something crazy, do the same math for all of the bacteria on earth...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884579</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the themes of forgeries, fakes, and the concept of "phantom time" in history. It examines how historical records can be manipulated or misinterpreted, leading to the creation of false narratives or timelines. The piece delves into famous cases of forgery and the implications these have on our understanding of the past. It also discusses the motivations behind such deceptions and how they can challenge the authenticity of historical scholarship, highlighting the importance of critical analysis in studying history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fomenko's theories, mentioned in the article, are pretty fascinating. I love the romance of the idea that history is all wrong and that everything was made up at a variety of chokepoints around literacy and access to original documents.Fundamentally it seems implausible (extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence and all) but it's fun to read about, although I have not braved his actual writings to get context (I do, oddly, have a couple of mathematical textbooks that he wrote, however).The most interesting thing that I saw was his critique of carbon-14 dating. And while I don't concede the central point, it led me down a rabbit hole of realizing that carbon dating is a lot more complex and rule-of-thumb driven than I would have thought, because in the end it relies upon historic atmospheric C14/C12 ratios that we mostly have good information on from ... radiocarbon dating on artifacts of known provenance. That's not the entirety of the story but it was surprising to me that something that is so often thrown out as an example of formal scientific methods in history is so heuristic and complex, rather than a simple application of math and physics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If people are interested in this type of conspiracy theory / pseudo history, another one I find fascinating is the "Lost Empire" of Tartaria [1].[1] https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/what-is-the-lo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is entirely unplausible. We have a heck of a lot of arachnology refuting this theory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880740</guid></item><item><title>50.

In December of last year, the IMF reached an agreement with President Nayib Bukele’s government on the loan of the stated amount to strengthen the country’s “fiscal sustainability” and mitigate the “risks associated with Bitcoin,” as it was described.—-I dislike cryptocurrencies as much as the next guy but this was clearly something else than a failure of the currency itself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's heavy editorializing:El Salvador keeps buying the Bitcoin for its strategic reserve. Businesses and citizens can keep using it.But for getting an IMF loan, IMF (which, to put it mildly, doesn't like Bitcoin) required the end to Bitcoin legal tender status.Now the businesses are free to accept it or not instead of being required to accept it. That's all. The government plans to keep buying and using it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The government, she assured, will continue buying bitcoin and having reserves in this cryptocurrencySounds like the term "Failed Experiment" is the writer's assertion and not the government official position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42925210</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The website showcases a chat interface developed by Daniel Delaney, featuring an interactive text-based communication platform. Users can communicate with an AI, engage in conversations, and explore various functionalities like generating responses, asking questions, and receiving insightful answers. The site emphasizes user experience and aims to demonstrate the capabilities of conversational AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to take a contrarian view and say it's actually a good UI, but it's all about how you approach it.I just finished a small project where I used o3-mini and o3-mini-high to generate most of the code. I averaged around 200 lines of code an hour, including the business logic and unit tests. Total was around 2200 lines. So, not a big project, but not a throw away script. The code was perfectly fine for what we needed. This is the third time I've done this, and each time I get faster and better at it.1. I find a "pair programming" mentality is key. I focus on the high-level code, and let the model focus on the lower level code. I code review all the code, and provide feedback. Blindly accepting the code is a terrible approach.2. Generating unit tests is critical. After I like the gist of some code, I ask for some smoke tests. Again, peer review the code and adjust as needed.3. Be liberal with starting a new chat: the models can get easily confused with longer context windows. If you start to see things go sideways, start over.4. Give it code examples. Don't prompt with English only.FWIW, o3-mini was the best model I've seen so far; Sonnet 3.5 New is a close second.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm growing to the idea that chat is a bad UI pattern, period.  It is a great record of correspondence, I think.  But it is a terrible UI for doing anything.In large, I assert this is because the best way to do something is to do that thing.  There can be correspondence around the thing, but the artifacts that you are building are separate things.You could probably take this further and say that narrative is a terrible way to build things.  It can be a great way to communicate them, but being a separate entity, it is not necessarily good at making any artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that the article (and comments) haven't mentioned Cursor.Agreed that copy pasting context in and out of ChatGPT isn't the fastest workflow. But Cursor has been a major speed up in the way I write code. And it's primarily through a chat interface, but with a few QOL hacks that make it way faster:1. Output gets applied to your file in a git-diff style. So you can approve/deny changes.2. It (kinda) has context of your codebase so you don't have to specify as much. Though it works best when you explicitly tag files ("Use the utils from @src/utils/currency.ts")3. Directly inserting terminal logs or type errors into the chat interface is incredibly convenient. Just hover over the error and click the "add to chat"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42934190</guid></item><item><title>3.

It was 12:30 at night but I couldn't pass down the opportunity to build it.The code is very simple, there's no backend at all actually, I believe because wikipedia's api is very permissive and you can just make the requests in the frontend. So you just simply request random articles, get some snippets, and the image attached!I used Claude and cursor do 90% of the heavy lifting, so I am positive there's plenty of room for optimizations. But right now as it stands, it's quite fun to play with, even without anything very sophisticated.Here is the source code.
https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonder what it would take to add a simple algorithm to this. Part of what makes short media apps (dangerously) addictive is that they eventually learn what you like and feed you more of that. An app like this with such an algo could help with the stickiness (and presumably get us away from the other apps at least for a little bit). "Oh this person likes science stuff, let's feed them more, oh they specifically like stuff related to quantum mechanics, let's place a summary paragraph from a related page topic in there."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome. I have a project with a similar tik-tok-esque philosophy for serving all sorts of noncommercial content from the web. The interface is one button and a random page is embedded in an iframe. I use random wikipedia pages as a fallback in case my algorithm returns a dead page.I call it moonjump: https://moonjump.app/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42936723</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the launch of the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) digital library, which aims to preserve and provide access to significant video game artifacts, including documentation, images, and other materials. The library serves as a resource for researchers, historians, and enthusiasts interested in the history of video games, showcasing the importance of preserving these cultural artifacts for future generations. The initiative is positioned as a step towards enhancing public knowledge and appreciation of video game history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool.Rather than be a jerk and talk about why there are so few references to the text and early graphics games from the 60s and 70s, maybe I'll have to pitch the VGHF people on a blog post and book and software collection focused on the 60s-70s era of computer gaming.I was introduced to computers (and computer gaming) in the mid-70s, just immediately before the "trinity" microcomputers hit the market in '77.  Our school district in North Texas had access to an HP mainframe (HP-2000?) to teach advanced kids BASIC.  Part of my early education involved tearing apart the text-oriented BASIC versions of Hammurabi, Hunt the Wumpus and Star Trek.  They would hardly be called "games" today.  My dad had business contacts at UIUC and they were infamous for giving ANYONE a PLATO account, so I learned about the friendly orange glow and social computing in "the data center in the corn field."  Anyone who played rogue or PLATO/EMPIRE could see where the industry was going by 1980.And the sad bit is we've lost most of the people who developed these games in the 60s and 70s.  I think I'll pitch the idea of a small collection of David Ahl books, DECUS games tapes and an interview or two with a few of the remaining coders.Give me a +1 if you're hip to the old text based games, often coded in BASIC and played on microcomputers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s both funny and fitting that a video game library opens in ‘early access’. Apart from adding more games over time, I don’t see the distinction between early access and an actual release.The website is operational and usable, and will have more content added to it over time. Much like early access games. I wonder what the actual distinction is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool. It's a wonderful goal to preserve stuff like this.That said, it is of course bizarre that we've gotten to a place where a video game history museum can't have video games for legal reasons. Imagine a museum of paleontology that can show you photos of paleontologists digging but can't show you any dinosaur bones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42926076</guid></item><item><title>5.

If it's considered a "national treasure", obviously, it cannot be sold to anyone, and quite honestly it MUST be scanned and be available on the internet for anybody interested to read it. If it's unimportant enough to be sold to a personal collection, it's also nobody's business what the buyer will do to that stuff.This reminds me: are there even any good scans of the Portsmouth Papers that Keynes bought? Or is this stuff still just buried in various museum archives, seen only by certified friends of the museum's director?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The incoming signal is turned into 4000 bits per second then XORed with a large pseudorandom sequence.[1]. It's quite interesting what was possible given such limited hardware at the time.I've seen multivibrators as frequency dividers in the repair work I've done. The clever thing here would be in the initialization, and synchronization at the receive end. I'd imagine that wheel has to be spun up to some fraction of 4000 rotations/second and uses photodiodes or perhaps just contact, to generate the starting pulses.[1] https://www.turing.org.uk/sources/delilah.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933049</guid></item><item><title>6.

Evite has kinda been the go-to in her social/co-op group for ages, but man it suuuuuuucks these days.  Ads everywhere, annoying patterns, and lacks a bunch of nice features that this seems to have.Very happy to see this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brilliant move.The transition of the major social networks over the last 10-15 years -- from being a space for friends to interact to being a space to consume content produced by "unconnected" entities like influencers -- has created a huge opening for someone to claim the friends and family network. There is no one better positioned (at least in the U.S. where iPhones are the majority handset) than Apple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42934422</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Elon Musk's views on the role of government in the technological landscape, particularly in relation to young engineers. Musk argues that government regulation can stifle innovation and that a more empowering environment is necessary for engineers to thrive. He emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining talent in the tech industry, suggesting that reducing bureaucratic hurdles could enhance creative problem-solving and accelerate progress.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the European Union's new regulation banning AI systems that pose unacceptable risks to safety and fundamental rights. This move is part of a comprehensive approach to AI governance aimed at ensuring technology does not harm individuals or society. The regulation outlines specific categories of AI considered too risky, requires strict compliance from developers, and introduces penalties for violations in an effort to foster responsible innovation while protecting citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always sigh when I see these threads on HN because many of the comments (although not all, thankfully) devolve into US / EU name-calling and wild overgeneralisations.I would really love to see a Q&amp;A thread like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770125 from someone who's actually read the documents, practices law in the area, and also understands the difference between US and EU law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not expert but there seems to be an overlap in the article between 'AI' and well ... just software, or signal processing:- AI that collects “real time” biometric data in public places for the purposes of law enforcement.- AI that creates — or expands — facial recognition databases by scraping images online or from security cameras.- AI that uses biometrics to infer a person’s characteristics- AI that collects “real time” biometric data in public places for the purposes of law enforcement.All of the above can be achieved with just software, statistics, old ML techniques, i.e. 'non hype' AI kind of software.I am not familiar with the detail of the EU AI pact but it seems like the article is simplifying important details.I assume the ban is on the purpose/usage rather than whatever technology is used under the hood, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like a mostly reasonable list of things to not let AI do without better safety evals.&gt; AI that tries to infer people’s emotions at work or schoolI wonder how broadly this will be construed. For example if an agent uses CoT and they needs emotional state as part of that, can it be used in a work or school setting at all?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42916849</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the key differences between Deno and Oracle, focusing on their respective use cases, design philosophies, and functionalities. Deno is presented as a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, emphasizing security, simplicity, and developer experience, while Oracle is highlighted as a robust database solution designed for enterprise-level applications. The comparison explores aspects like dependency management, performance, and ease of use, ultimately showcasing how Deno’s features align with contemporary software development needs compared to Oracle's more traditional approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate Ryan taking this up, and the updates are interesting.Obviously I'm not paying for the lawyers but it feels like "oh Oracle is trying to add months of delays" feels pretty normal. Only months! If the process just trudges along for a couple of years before reaching a "good" conclusion, still worth doing!And very happy that this is an actual legal proceeding and "try to sign a petition asking Oracle nicely" is no longer what is being looked at. It's Oracle!Imagine how far along ago we would be[0] if 2 years ago the lawyers started getting involved. Sometimes you just gotta do the thing that takes forever. Or at least try in parallel?[0]: Again, I'm not paying for the lawyers or doing anything useful at all!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best part of this article for me was seeing that Oracle's screenshots were taken in IE.Yes, those are old by now, but it's still a blast from the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowing Oracle, they will take it to court if they can. To paraphrase Cantrill, it's a company that behaves very much like a lawnmower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42939940</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant shortage of air traffic controllers in the United States, highlighting the challenges faced by the aviation industry due to increasing flight demands and an aging workforce. It outlines factors contributing to the shortfall, including lengthy training processes and low recruitment rates. The piece also emphasizes the potential impact on flight safety and efficiency, and suggests possible solutions such as better recruitment incentives and improved working conditions to attract new talent into the profession.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone is going to make this about money or unions or etc, but my employer briefly worked with some ATC employee groups and I can tell you exactly why they are short staffed:- The FAA has strict hiring requirements. You have to be mentally and physically capable, and by their own admission less than 10% of applicants are qualified for the job. https://www.faa.gov/air-traffic-controller-qualifications- The training and onboarding process is incredibly long, and turnover is high- The fundamentals and technology of the job have not changed in decades, despite air traffic exploding in recent years- Most people are just not capable of the amount of stress and risk associated with the job- Seriously, it's a really freaking stressful jobI would argue an ATC employee is worth every penny, but I also don't think there is a magical amount of money where you are going to suddenly double your pool of candidates willing to do this kind of work. These people are already very well compensated, and at a certain point you are just going to be cannibalizing other talent pools.The real need is new and modern technology that automates much of the mistake-prone, human-centric tasks. But nobody wants to risk introducing changes to such a fragile system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"US ATC System Under Scrutiny" "Fatal crash brings attention to shortage" "There are simply not enough air traffic controllers to keep aircraft a safe distance from one another."Like, perhaps there is merit in arguing for more controllers or more pay for controllers, and perhaps that would lead to a safer airspace, but the attempts to implicitly tie the fatal crash to ATC in this case seems pretty poor form, here. What we know from the ATC transcripts[1] already tells us that ATC was aware the helicopter &amp; the plane would be near each other well in advance of the crash; ATC informed the helo, the helo responded that he had the aircraft in sight. Time passed, the ATC gets a proximity warning (labelled as "[Conflict Alert Warning]" in VASAviation's video), ATC immediately acts on it, again reaching out to the helo, the helo again confirms they have the aircraft in sight, and moments later we can hear on the ATC transcripts the crash occur as people in the room witness it and react in horror.To my armchair commenting self, the ATC controllers seem to be exonerated by the transcript, and I'm going to otherwise wait until an NTSB report tells me why I'm wrong to break out the pitch forks on them.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gD_lnBNu0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first problem is that everybody who wants to do the job needs to go through the FAA academy in Oklahoma, which is seriously limited by physical &amp; instructor capacity.  So only a couple thousand people a year can work their way through there, no matter how many are willing to do the job.So first we need more training capacity, and they already have trouble hiring and retaining instructors.  This is a more direct place you can throw more money at now.A start would be moving some of the primary training to the control centers.  There's more than one of them, spread around the country, and they already have their own significant training departments.A significant fraction of people who get into the academy end up not making the cut.  Then another good fraction "wash out" during extensive training for the specific airport/center they end up in.It's a very difficult job and nothing they've tried before is very good at predicting who's going to be successful at it quickly/cheaply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933840</guid></item><item><title>11.

We actually have competitors in that space, who will do that and more.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Linguistic Knowledge and Its Impact on Neural Machine Translation" explores the relationship between linguistic knowledge and the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. It discusses how incorporating linguistic features such as syntax, semantics, and morphology can enhance translation quality. The authors examine various methodologies to integrate this knowledge into NMT frameworks and evaluate its effectiveness through experiments and results. Overall, the paper highlights the significance of linguistic insights in improving the capabilities of machine translation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of the Agent Workflow Memory (AWM) paper [1], which also tries to find optimal decision paths for LLM-based agents but relies on in-context learning, whereas DeepRAG fine-tunes models to decide when to retrieve external knowledge.I’ve been thinking about how modifying AWM to use fine-tuning or an external knowledge system (RAG) might work—capturing the ‘good’ workflows it discovers rather than relying purely on prompting.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07429 - Agent Workflow Memory (Wang et al., 2024)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Noice!Does anyone have a good recommendation for a local dev setup that does something similar with available tools? Ie incorporates a bunch of PDFs (~10,000 pages of datasheets) and other docs, as well as a curl style importer?Trying to wean myself off the next tech molochs, ideally with local functionality similar to OpenAIs Search + Reason, and gave up on Langchain during my first attempt 6 months ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title reads awkwardly to a native English speaker. A search of the PDF for "latency" returns one result, discussing how naive RAG can result in latency. What are the latency impacts and other trade-offs to achieve the claimed "[improved] answer accuracy by 21.99%"? Is there any way that I could replicate these results without having to write my own implementation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932948</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I studied an BSc in genetics and none of our lectures or textbooks presented mitochondria any differently from the classic bean shape they introduce in school. This is surely old news to folks who specialise in mitochondria, but it's easy to miss out on these fundamentals even if you've studied in a relevant area at degree level, because there's just so much to know in biology.In fact, it's one of those fields where the more you learn, the more you realise we'll never reach a satisfactory understanding in our lifetime. You could chuck an endless supply of PhD students at every constituent domain for generations and still feel like you've scarcely scratched the surface of the many things there are to question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mitochondria are a descendant of early bacteria which infiltrated an Archaea cell, traded genes, and started replicating with it, forming a new organism about 1.5bn years ago.The wild part is that all mitochondria are descended from that single event.This was a rather controversial theory called Endosymbiosis and it was pioneered by Lynn Margulis. Now it is widely accepted.https://evolution.berkeley.edu/it-takes-teamwork-how-endosym...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone here have a sense of what time frame the video covers? Like, is that real-time and mitochondria are continuously mildly active? Is it vastly slowed down and mitochondria are ripping around in our cells like madmen? Is it vastly sped up and mitochondria are actually relatively static, slow movers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899168</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp is a version of the Allegro Common Lisp programming environment designed for use on classic Macintosh systems. The site provides information about its features, system requirements, and download options, enabling users to leverage the powerful programming capabilities of Common Lisp on older Macintosh computers. The resource serves both as a historical reference and a practical guide for enthusiasts and developers interested in utilizing Lisp on vintage Mac hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "smolagents" includes examples focused on applying deep reinforcement learning techniques to various research problems. Specifically, the "open_deep_research" directory contains a collection of example implementations that showcase how to use smolagents for experimenting with different RL architectures and algorithms. The aim is to provide a platform for researchers and developers to explore, iterate, and contribute to the development of efficient agent-based systems, encouraging collaboration and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s compared with OpenAI deep research’s score of 67.36%..Worth noting is that there are a number of OpenAI deep research “reproductions” on the web, some of which rely on open models and tooling. The crucial component they — and Open Deep Research — lack is o3, the model underpinning deep research.Blog post, https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi all! Aymeric (m-ric) here, maintainer of smolagents and part of the team who built this. Happy to see this interesting people here!Few points:- open Deep Research is not a production app, but it could easily be productionized (would need to be faster + good UX).- As the GAIA score of 55% (not 54%, that would be lame) says, it's not far from the Deep Research score of 67%. It's also not there yet: I think the main point of progress is to improve web browsing. We're working on integrating vision models (for now we've used a text browser developed by the Microsofit autogen team, congrats to them) because it's probably the best way to really interact with webpages.- Open Deep Research is built on smolagents, a library that we're building, for which the core is having agents that write their actions (tool calls) in code snippets instead of the unpractical JSON blobs + parsing that everyone incl OpenAI and Anthropic use for their agentic/tool-calling APIs. Don't hesitate to go try out the lib and drop issues/PRs!- smolagents does code execution, which means "danger for your machine" if ran locally. We've railguardeed that a bit with our custom python interpreter, but it will never be 100% safe, so we're enabling remote execution with E2B and soon Docker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I signed up for Gemini Advanced to get access to Deep Research on Feb 1st and felt on top of the world. So cool, so advanced.Then OpenAI announced theirs on the 2nd:

It's about a 1-2 miles away from the predominantly African American neighborhood that was constantly bombed in the 50s.I was told the FBI searched the building a few decades ago in the hopes of finding the rifle used in MLK's assassination.Birmingham was a wild town for many years!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related: if somebody is interested in King's story in more depth, I can really recommend Jonathan Eig's book from 2023, titled "King: A Life". Amongst many other resources, he has used the (back then) recently released FBI files about King. He did a really stellar job of portraying MLK not just as a legend, but also as a human being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's just a symbolic order, won't actually lead to anything important being released because the agencies have the authority to reject whatever they want.

What we get out of these budgets is a bargain:&gt; The biggest single share of the NIH budget goes to the NCI ($7.8 billion in 2024), and the second-most to the NIAID ($6.5 billion) with the National Institute of Aging coming in third at $4.4 billion. (See the tables on numbered pages 11 and 46 of that link at the beginning of the paragraph for the details).&gt; And to put those into perspective, the largest single oulay for the Federal government is Social Security benefits ($1.4 trillion by themselves), with interest on the national debt coming in second at $949 billion, Medicare comes in third at $870 billion, and the Department of Defense fourth at $826 billion and Medicaid next at $618 billion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cynic in me thinks that the US is going to roll over and take this fascist shake down.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used jj for about one month on a project with a colocated git repo.So far, I enjoy it a lot. Previously I would have a bunch of 'wip', 'fix typo' commits, but my commit history got much cleaner with jj. It's very easy to jump to old changes and apply fixes right in the place they belong. All changes + tests are now committed as one unit. I would never bother to do it in git, but because it's so easy now, I do it all the time.Also, the possibility to add a description/message at any time, not only when you "commit" something at the end, is super useful. I use it as some kind of TODO list. Basically, I create a bunch of empty commits with a message and then just start from the first and work my way through all of them with `jj next --edit`.If you have some extra time and would like to try out something new, I would very much recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I'm at risk of sounding like a broken record here. I've read about jj many times now but i'm still confused as to what problem it actually solves. I get the same feeling as when some dude wants to sell me on using vim as my primary code editor - arguments are there but it doesn't really solve an issue.I'll go over to jj when that's the primary tool for the job, or when I can see something that beats the git cli hands down. I'm 100% on the path of least resistance when it comes to tool adoption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using jj for a month, coming from mercurial. I have settled into a usage pattern slightly different than the article describes, so that all of those `jj edit` commands made me a little itchy. I prefer to nearly always use a separate @ commit to hold any changes I make. The mental model is that there's a graph of commits, and then @ is an auto-updated commit to hold any changes I make in an editor or whatever. Actually modifying anything in the core graph is then a conscious decision, and I might decide to update a commit with my changes (`jj squash` or `jj squash --into X`) or make the changes into a commit of their own (`jj describe` if I haven't already, followed by `jj new` to return to the stable state of having an @ commit for collecting changes).The reason why I don't like using `jj edit` on something in the graph is that every change I make is conceptually applied immediately to all descendants. It's sort of like plucking a commit out of the graph (the commit you're editing), entering a mode where you can only modify that commit and don't have the option to use the changes in a different way (as in, squash some of them to some other commit or make a new branch or whatever).It makes jj modal, and one of the things I most appreciate about jj is that it is not modal, you don't have a separate staging area or stash or anything, it's always in the same consistent state where you can do the same set of things.Also, having a separate commit makes it easy to see how you've modified things, rather than only being able to see the sum total of the original commit contents plus your recent modifications. (It does make it a little harder to see that sum: `jj diff --from @--`.)This is also the default behavior of `jj next` and `jj prev`, which are very confusing if you're expecting to be editing nodes in the graph directly. You can totally do that, by passing `--edit` to them, and if that's your preference you can default the flag in the config.I do still use `jj edit` from time to time, but for the most part `jj new` gives me a better feeling of control. It was difficult initially to not want the "extra empty change" to go away, but once I accepted that there's really only one and it corresponds to a meaningful concept (it's the auto-updated container for any changes you make), I made peace with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42934427</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the initiative to promote decentralized push notifications, highlighting the importance of user control and privacy in communication. It outlines the current challenges faced by centralized systems, such as data privacy issues and reliance on single providers. The call to action emphasizes the need for developers to adopt decentralized protocols to create a more robust and user-centric notification ecosystem, encouraging collaboration and innovation within the tech community to facilitate this shift.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was surprised how easy it was to integrate. I'm on GrapheneOS/FDroid. I installed the ntfy app and connected it to my ntfy server. I wanted to set it up for Tusky (Mastodon app).  I was confused about the lack of instructions. What do I set on Tusky? What do I set on all my Mastodon servers? It turned out there were no instructions. I was already configured for Tusky. Tusky found the ntfy app, got my ntfy server's URL from it, and passed it on to the Mastodon servers.Now, I actually think this is a little too easy. What if I want to keep my ntfy server private for certain at-home uses? But still, very impressive. Element does it right, it at least asks you when you open the app (or it's in a setting or something). But I think UnifiedPush or ntfy instructions should make these steps more clear (or I failed to find it), even if just to say "it's actually that easy" to save our time looking.BTW I'm working on porting ntfy to Sandstorm. Already works, I just have a handful of loose ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that there are self-hostable XMPP-based implementations for this: https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/conversations/What is old is new again (Google used XMPP for Android Push Notifications before they switched to something else).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Regarding iOS, they have made some progress in adopting webpush, but it does not seem possible to push for mobile applications with it yet.This is a key point right at the very end.  It has always been much easier to implement push notifications to Android devices, even when only Web Push is implemented.  
Google has been the main force behind the adoption of PWAs as Native apps on devices, even by immediately showing a "Install this app?" popup when navigating to a PWA-enabled website/web app.iOS permits "Installing to home screen" but there is no popup shown natively, nor any indication from the OS that the website you're visiting is a PWA.  The user has to go through several steps to add the app to his device.Once it is added, it's possible for the device to receive web push notifications and show them as native push notifications (IIRC), even with the app is closed, however the reliability is inconsistent.  Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't. At least that was my experience still about 6 months ago when I tried implementing web push with PWA for iOS.I gave up trying to go the pure PWA route and instead wrapped my web app with PWABuilder into a native app, and went through the whole process of submitting to the App Store, getting APN, registering the web app in Firebase, then sending the push notifications to the native app via Firebase Messaging.  Works great then, but it's a lot more work than keeping everything simply as a web app and using web push.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897151</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits and features of GraalVM Native Image, which allows developers to compile Java applications into standalone executables, enabling faster startup times and reduced memory consumption. It outlines the advantages of using native images, such as improved performance and portability, while also addressing the challenges, including the complexity of configuration and the need for ahead-of-time compilation. The author provides insights into practical use cases and best practices for leveraging GraalVM Native Image in software development, encouraging experimentation and exploration for optimized application deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Almost every Java program, library, and framework uses some degree of reflection and dynamic classloading, and so you do have to spend the effort to configure Graal appropriately." -- this is by far the biggest problem with native binary compilation.Imagine spending 15+ minutes building an exe, and it stopping at minute 15 because some things needed to be added in the config. Or, after waiting 30 minutes to have the exe ready, it refused to run because of the same problem.The issue is we don't know what we don't know. You don't "forget to include something" because you don't know what to include (and even after seeing the error, you still don't lol).I just wished all 3rd party libraries put their "include this config to include my lib in your exe", just like OSGi manifest (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wasdtfe?topic=overview-osgi-bund...).For example, an issue still open for almost 2 years: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-java/issues/800&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Graal can only create native binaries targeting the system on which it is running. That means that if you want to create binaries for {Linux,Windows,Mac}x{Intel,ARM}, you need 6 different machines in order to build the 6 binaries and somehow aggregate them together for publication or deployment. This is not a blocker, but can definitely be inconvenient v.s. some other toolchains which allow you to build native binaries for all targets on a single machine.To me this is a huge downside. One of the reasons I like Go so much is that I can build binaries for any platform I want to support on my Mac or with Docker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm under the impression that the Community Edition version of GraalVM is neutered by a limited garbage collector and some other limitations when producing native binaries.Anyone know if this true?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42904723</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The gist provides a tutorial on how to set up and use Elm, a functional programming language for front-end web development. It outlines the steps for installing Elm, creating a new Elm project, and explains the basic structure of an Elm application. Additionally, it covers compiling Elm code, running an Elm server, and creating a simple Elm program that interacts with the browser. The tutorial is geared towards beginners and emphasizes interactive and maintainable web application development using Elm's unique features.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the first justification of not using Rust that I actually agree with. Well written.I recommend reading Roc's FAQ too - it's got some really great points. E.g. I'm internally screaming YESSS! to this: https://www.roc-lang.org/faq.html#curried-functionsBut then it has other weird features too, like they seem to be really emphasising "friendliness" (great!) but then it has weird syntax like `\` for anonymous functions (I dunno where that dumb syntax came from by Nix also uses it and it's pretty awful).  Omitting brackets and commas for function calls is also a bad decision if you care about friendliness. I have yet to find a language where that doesn't make the code harder to read and understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Zig came up with a way around this: compile directly to LLVM bitcode (LLVM has strong backwards-compatibility on its bitcode but not on its public-facing API) and then upgrades become trivial because we can keep our existing code generation the same.i'm glad that zig helps offset what i find a rather worrying trend -- replacing protocols with libraries (and as a consequence designing new underlying protocols in view of their only being used through the vendor library).protocols are traditionally designed to facilitate an independent implementation; in fact, many standards ratification processes require several independent implementations as a prerequisite.libraries (or worse, frameworks) intermingle the actual api with their own design, and necessitate a single implementation.just the other day i wanted to display a notification a linux desktop where it wasn't convenient to depend on a library (it was a game, so not a traditional application expected to have many dependencies). the protocol (there is one, wrapped by the library) is very unpleasant, but i got it working out of spite.and of course, when there is a perfectly nice protocol available (llvm ir, in either the bitcode or text representation) why not choose it? at least on unix, where starting processes and interprocess communication is cheap. (and as an added bonus, you won't crash when llvm does.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice to see Zig continuing to gain support. I have no idea why I've ended up siding with Zig in the lower languages wars.I used to root for the D programming language but it seems to have got stuck and never gained a good ecosystem. I've disliked Rust from the first time I saw it and have never warmed up to it's particular trade offs. C feels unergonomic these days and C++ is overfull with complexity. Zig feels like a nice pragmatic middle ground.I actually think Rust is probably perfectly suited to a number of tasks, but I feel I would default to choosing Zig unless I was certain beyond doubt that I needed specific Rust safety features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42935516</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Senator Josh Hawley's proposal to impose jail time on individuals who download the controversial app DeepSeek. The app, which allows users to access and share content on the internet that some consider sensitive or harmful, has raised concerns about privacy and security. The senator's plan reflects a broader concern among lawmakers regarding the implications of such technologies and their potential misuse. The piece highlights the ongoing debate about regulation, digital privacy, and the boundaries of technology in society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the one hand Hawley proposes a lot of things that don't ever get close to becoming law.On the other hand, we did ban TikTok (which is currently unavailable on the app stores because of the ban).I can think of few ways to more effectively destroy any US advantage in AI compared with the sheer efficiency of making it illegal to learn from what competing countries have achieved. From the article, it sounds like the proposed legislation is deeply confused about what "downloading DeepSeek" means--they're _talking_ about banning the app, while _writing_ laws to ban "the importation into the United States of artificial intelligence or generative artificial intelligence technology or intellectual proprietary developed or produced in the People’s Republic of China" which is a lot broader. Is it proposing to ban US citizens from reading research papers written by Chinese citizens? Or from publishing research in places that might be read by them? Apparently the EFF is concerned that the language of the bill is, indeed, that broad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The Republican Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley has introduced a new bill that would make it illegal to import or export artificial intelligence products to and from China, meaning someone who knowingly downloads a Chinese developed AI model like the now immensely popular DeepSeek could face up to 20 years in jail, a million dollar fine, or both, should such a law pass.You get less jail time for committing 34 felonies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Every dollar and gig of data that flows into Chinese AI are dollars and data that will ultimately be used against the United States,” Senator Hawley said in a statement. “America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary at the expense of our own strength. Ensuring American economic superiority means cutting China off from American ingenuity and halting the subsidization of CCP innovation.”Oh goodness me!. If that's true, then why not just completely block China's IP addresses from our Internet? Why not just block all dollars from entering China?Oh right, because that's not the truth. It's certainly not the whole of it anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42925001</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;Vanguard has announced a significant reduction in its average investment fee to just 0.07%, marking the largest fee cut in its history. This reduction reflects the company's ongoing commitment to lowering costs for investors and maintaining its competitive edge in the asset management industry. The move is part of Vanguard's strategy to enhance shareholder value amid a growing trend toward lower fees in the investment sector. The article highlights the implications of this fee cut for investors and the broader market landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of this relates to its dominance in workplace accounts, but Vanguard hasn't helped itself with some bad customer-facing software updates and a perception that its service levels are poor compared to Fidelity.Cutting fees helps, but Fidelity has shown its willing to do this, too, including no fee "Zero" index funds: https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/investing-ideas/index-... (note Fidelity is very clear about who it's competing with)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll be contrarian. The general wisdom is hold the fund with the lowest fee structure.However, if the fee structure is 0.07%, that's $70/year / 100k invested. Even if it's 0.44%, you're talking about $440.The fees on most funds are small enough now to not matter much. It's worth shopping for lower-fee funds, but the more you go below 0.5%, the less it matters. If I save $500 per year for 50 years, that's $25k+interest, which is kind of the breakpoint of where it has practical impact on e.g. when I can retire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933283</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet I also feel the things C910 does well are overshadowed by executing poorly on the basics. The core’s out-of-order engine is poorly balanced, with inadequate capacity in critical structures like the schedulers and register files in relation to its ROB capacity. CPU performance is often limited by memory access performance, and C910’s cache subsystem is exceptionally weak. The cluster’s shared L2 is both slow and small, and the C910 cores have no mid-level cache to insulate L1 misses from that L2. DRAM bandwidth is also lackluster.I'm not a CPU designer but shouldn't this be points that one could discover using higher-level simulators? Ie before even needing to do FPGA or gate-level sims?If so, are they doing a SpaceX thing where they iterate fast with known less-than-optimal solutions just to gain experience building the things?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another amazing analysis by Chester Lam. I'm astounded of the cadence and persistence, and at the same time the depth and comprehensiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some comparative benchmarks on a slightly older post: https://chipsandcheese.com/p/a-risc-v-progress-check-benchma...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42928482</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a 29,000-year-old sculpture from Dolní Věstonice, Czech Republic, which is considered the oldest known human portrait. This prehistoric clay figure, representing a female head, offers valuable insights into the artistic capabilities and cultural practices of early humans. The sculpture reflects advanced techniques in modeling and opens up discussions about the significance of human representation in prehistoric art. Researchers highlight the importance of this finding in understanding the evolution of human creativity and social behavior during the Upper Paleolithic period.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Not related to the sculpture, just a bit of pedantry.) I appreciate the attempt to render the name of the locality in the present-day local alphabet (Czech), but the diacritic above the 'e' in "Vĕstonice" is wrong: the letter is "letter e with breve", but should be "letter e with caron", giving "Věstonice".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reconstruction using modern methodshttps://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/imag...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of faces in most prehistoric art has always been fascinating to me, especially given the attention to detail paid to animals in cave paintings. Did people not give as much thought to individual identity before a certain milestone in our development as a species? Was it taboo or superstition to render someone's likeness? Were caves just not the place for portraiture? Why was this seemingly prevalent across cultures and geography? Etc etc; people with more to say than me have written about it at length I assume. This bust is from 24000BC, and the person depicted was 1) presumably already dead and 2) might have had a developmental deformity. Maybe that provides some clues about when, how, and why portraiture developed as an art form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42926423</guid></item><item><title>31.

I've worked at a company that could have remained more competitive (and done a better job of maintaining software that is critical to human life) if there had been more uptake of ideas from workers instead of simply trying to make shareholders happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My dad had a manager recently that he started calling "VPGPT" behind his back.He felt like the guy primarily spoke in truisms and with long-winded statements that ultimately said very little but gave the illusion of having depth.  He wasn't a huge fan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately our CEO at a 5000 person company that heavily uses Slack, still hasn't activated their Slack account, so I don't have much to finetune the bot on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933256</guid></item><item><title>35.

https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/master/src/parse.y#L19...And queries itself to get the schema:
https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/802b042f6ef89285bc0e72...Lots of questions, but the main one is whether we have made any progress with these new toolchains and programming languages w/ respect to performance or robustness.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad title for the list.  The books by Feynman, Weinberg, Sagan, Steinbeck, McPhee, and Levi didn't shape science. At best they are good descriptions of what happened in the century.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The inclusion of Vonnegut's _Cat's Cradle_ is bizarre --- it posits an impossible substance, with bizarre properties, and examines society in a way I have trouble relating to, and its commentary on science such as it is, is if anything, discouraging._Dune_ for its role in inspiring the study of ecology would seem more fitting.It's unfortunate that a didactic text such as H. Beam Piper's novella "Omnilingual" couldn't be considered instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like an excellent resource. Unfortunately, at present, all the links are broken within the document.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933507</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the proposal for implementing a linear collider facility at CERN, emphasizing its potential to advance particle physics research. It outlines the benefits of a linear collider in exploring new physics beyond the current Standard Model, facilitating precision measurements of particles like the Higgs boson, and helping to identify underlying structures of the universe. The article highlights the collaborative efforts involved in the project, including international partnerships and the technological innovations required for its realization, aiming for eventual approval and construction timelines that align with future research needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "cold copper" accelerator technology is really neat, in my opinion. The way particle accelerators work is that they pump RF through waveguides into cavities, such that the electric field pushes on the electrons right as they enter the cavity. Historically, they've been built with geometry like cylinders and rectangles where the fields can be worked out analytically, and that can be fabricated easily. They're proposing using modern computational modeling techniques to design better cavity geometries that can then be fabricated with modern CNC techniques. That should allow more efficient accelerators and higher acceleration gradients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in the area designated for the ILC (International Linear Collider) in Japan, but there has been no progress at all. The stakeholders are desperately trying to promote its benefits, but there is absolutely no understanding among the general public. The Japanese government is also not supportive at all. The country simply isn’t in a financial position to cover the several hundred billion yen needed for construction, and with rapid aging and a declining birthrate, there’s no prospect of the fiscal situation improving. Unfortunately, whether a new experimental facility can be built is more of a political issue than a scientific one, and the outlook is bleak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential, but, I remember reading about a recent technology that was supposed to allow building much smaller particle accelerators... does anyone have any idea what the status/applicability of that is?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42927082</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For folks who haven't operated an excavator, the trade-off with these mini-excavators isn't necessarily that they're underpowered. There are two other problems.First, they are very wobbly and you're gonna be limited by that. You really need a fair amount of surface contact and a robust counterweight when you're extending the arm and moving boulders, pulling out roots, or digging into hard soil.Second, you might look at specs and say "oh, cool, digging depth of 5 ft, I don't need more!". Except, this is attainable in one specific (and awkward) position of the excavator's boom and arm. It's less than that across most of the movement range.Another thing to keep in mind that this is not like buying a car. An excavator or a tractor deprecates far more slowly, and many private owners keep them for 20-30 years. A diesel excavator will need DIY maintenance and simple repairs, but it should hold up for life. Battery-powered equipment will probably need new battery packs before that. Just something to keep in mind when figuring out the pros and cons. If you're in the suburbs, noise is a concern, but then, you honestly don't need your own excavator...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related, Oslo has rules for reducing emissions from building sites which has made it a pioneer in the development and use of electric building machinery. Some of it is battery powered and some requires a really long extension cord. I do wonder how practical that is when maneuvering and if they need somebody to move the cable out of the way when it reverses.

I don't use it all of the time or all day, but the smoking old diesel is not the part of it that I enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42927391</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a hidden pyramid structure near the ancient city of Caral in Peru, which is considered one of the oldest urban centers in the Americas. Archaeologists utilized advanced scanning technology to reveal this previously concealed construction, suggesting that the Caral civilization may have had a more complex society than previously understood. The findings could provide new insights into the cultural and architectural practices of early Andean civilizations, emphasizing the importance of the Caral site in archaeological studies.&lt;/p&gt;

On a geology class field trip, a few hours south of Lima, our instructor stopped and pointed out a mound that would not have caught my eye at all. Then he explained how it makes no sense for a geological feature like that to be there.It was a covered structure. A Huaca. Lima has quite a few in the middle of the city. A stark reminder that we’ve been there ,intermittently, for millennia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have there been any recent books that try to reconstruct what pre-Columbian South America was like?I know that 1491 was a pretty good book about this.  But it's like 20 years old now.  And Lidar seems to have really opened up new insights in the past decade or so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that a pyramid was hidden for so long, just a kilometer from Caral, makes you wonder what else might still be buried in the region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897730</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I've heard people wax poetic about programming old, limited-memory machines. I wouldn't know anything about those---at the time they were current, I was writing rudimentary number-guessing games in BASIC. But doing this competition entry gave me a taste of what they might be talking about.One rather big difference here though, the limitation is on the size of the code, not the compiled binary. Most of the "optimizations" here have little to no effect on the code after it's compiled.With older computers, instead of removing line breaks from the code, you're doing things like tweaking compiler flags to shrink the size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This person is also the author of CodeMirror and ProseMirror, the best choices in my opinion for plain text editing and rich text editing respectively for the web platform&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't recommend "return true to win" (https://alf.nu/ReturnTrue) enough to learn how to golf JS. I think it's more accessible to learn one 10-20 char snippet at a time than a big project like a 1k submission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932137</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post by Madeline Miller discusses motion sickness as an accessibility issue in the context of digital experiences. It explains how certain animations and motion effects in apps and websites can trigger discomfort or nausea for some users, particularly those with vestibular disorders. The author emphasizes the importance of considering motion sensitivity in design choices and provides guidelines for creating accessible content, such as allowing users to disable animations, using simpler transitions, and adhering to best practices to improve the user experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Narrow FoV ruins me. Even after all these years, Far Cry 2 on PC was one of the worst video game experiences ever for me because it had FoV tuned for couch gaming. IIRC I was able to somewhat fix it with a console command to adjust the FoV, but actions like sprinting which forced the FoV to something even narrower than default would undo that.And for me motion sickness isn't felt in my stomach, it's in my head. The headaches get quite painful, so I very much appreciate games that give me an FoV slider with a reasonably large maximum. I'd rather not need to take meclizine to comfortably play a game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an important topic and I don't think this article is really getting into all the important things that have been learned about it over the past few years, primarily by VR developers.Too much of the current dialogue is about how players can "get over" it. This is silly. There are demonstrable, proven things which cause motion sickness via the visual system. Unfortunately there are some irreconcilable issues with doing certain activities (ie moving/turning without player input) in VR games so it's either abandon those activities or blame the users. Considering Meta has now poured nearly $85bn into their AR/VR effort, there's a lot on the line and the last thing they're going to do is admit that the technology is fundamentally limited to certain activities.Here's an early video from Oculus when it was still a bunch of enthusiasts chasing something magic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DgfiDEqfaY&amp;t=1356sBut nowadays you have people that play VR and have "VR Legs", and then you have the rest of us who have normal human brains and normal human eyes and don't want to take it upon ourselves to relearn how the world works so we don't puke when playing an FPS.The bottom line is that the human visual system is very sensitive to acceleration, especially in the peripheral vision. Acceleration can be linear, angular, or even in odd dimensions like during an FOV shift which god forbid a game would do without telling you.The easiest thing you can do to save yourself is get a smaller display or sit further away so that your peripheral vision is spared any of the motion and your fovea is gathering the majority of it. This is why "tunnel vision" in VR works for some people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one thing that will universally get me in a video game is head bob mixed with weapon sway. My brain will nope the heck out of those games almost instantly. I will happily ride the worst roller coasters, boats, busses, and cars I can find and get zero motion sickness. One minute playing Call of Duty? Done.FOV helps with some games, but the bob is always what gets me. I would love the option to turn stuff like that off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42888538</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a fellow "staff engineer" LLMs are terrible at writing or teaching how to write idiomatic code, and they are actually causing me to spend more time reviewing than I was previously due to the influx of junior to senior engineers trying to sneak in LLM garbage.In my opinion, using LLMs to write code comes as a faustian deal where you learn terrible practices and rely on code quantity, boilerplate, and indeterministic outputs - all hallmarks of poor software craftsmanship. Until ML can actually go end to end on requirements to product and they fire all of us, you can't cut corners on building intuition as a human by forgoing reading and writing code yourself.I do think that there is a place for LLMs in generating ideas or exploring an untrusted knowledge base of information, but using code generated from an LLM is pure madness unless what you are building is truly going to be thrown away and rewritten from scratch, as is relying on it as a linting, debugging, or source of truth tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On last resort bug fixes:&gt; I don’t do this a lot, but sometimes when I’m really stuck on a bug, I’ll attach the entire file or files to Copilot chat, paste the error message, and just ask “can you help?”The "reasoning" models are MUCH better than this. I've had genuinely fantastic results with this kind of thing against o1 and Gemini Thinking and the new o3-mini - I paste in the whole codebase (usually via my https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt tool) and describe the bug or just paste in the error message and the model frequently finds the source, sometimes following the path through several modules to get there.Here's a slightly order example: https://gist.github.com/simonw/03776d9f80534aa8e5348580dc6a8... - finding a bug in some Django middleware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience is similar: great for boilerplate, great for autocomplete, starts to fall apart on complex tasks, doesn't do much as far as business logic (how would it know?)- All in all very useful, but not replacing a decent practitioner any time soon.LLMs can absolutely bust out some corporate docs super crazy fast too... probably a reasonable thing to re-evaluate the value though&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409</guid></item><item><title>1.

Revered artisans are precisely the ones who care for the details. “Stressing” is your value judgement, not necessarily the ground truth.What you’re essentially saying is “cherish the people who care up to the level I personally and subjectively think is right, and dismiss everyone who cares more as insane weirdos who cannot prioritise”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Most programming should be done long before a single line of code is writtenNah.I (16+ years developer) prefer to iteratively go between coding and designing. It happens way too often that when you're coding, you stumble across something that makes you go "oh f me, that would NEVER work", which forces you to approach a problem entirely differently.Quite often you also have eureka moments with better solutions that just would not have happened unless you had code in front of you, which again makes you approach the problem entirely differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just personal opinions, I guess, I agree with most, but here are some I disagree with:- There is no pride in managing or understanding complexityComplexity exists, you can't make it go away, managing it and understanding it is the only thing you can do. Simple systems only displace complexity.- Java is a great language because it's boringThat is if you write Java the boring way. A lot of Java code (looking at you Spring) is everything but boring, and it is not fun either.- Most programming should be done long before a single line of code is writtenI went the opposite extreme. That is, if you are not writing code, you are not programming. If you are not writing code on your first day your are wasting time. It is a personal opinion, but the idea is that without doing something concrete, i.e. writing code, it is too easy to lose track of the reality, the reality being that in the end, you will have a program that runs on a machine. It doesn't mean you will have to keep that code.- Formal modeling and analysis is an essential skill setMaybe that explains our difference with regard to the last point. Given the opportunity, I prefer try stuff rather than formalize. It is not that formal modeling is useless, it is just less essential to me than experimentation. To quote Don Knuth out of context: "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it." ;)- You literally cannot add too many comments to test code (I challenge anyone to try)time++; // increment time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946281</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The Kagi changelog entry for version 6.1.5.5 highlights several updates and improvements made to the Kagi search engine platform. Key changes include enhancements to search result relevance, improved query handling, and various user interface updates aimed at optimizing the overall user experience. The update focuses on refining performance, increasing user control over search customization, and resolving minor bugs to ensure smoother functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This makes sense, if someone isn't using your service for a month, chances are good that they are going to cancel soon. Maybe they'll keep on paying for another few months, but if they're not using it, they're not getting any value from it.So rather than getting them to cancel, pause their subscription. You don't have to deal with cancellations, and if/when the user does return, you are one step further than you would be with a new subscription.Furthermore this generates goodwill, and I'm guessing goodwill has some % that converts to conversions and lower churn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, I will never be able to take advantage of this policy, For the very reason that I have kagi Set as my exclusive search engine on every single device that I own, And there's no way that I could go even a Day, let alone a month, without using this fantastic service.Keep up the good work guys!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just recently i was actually thinking about this pricing approach for netflix, apple arcade or whatever else. Basically i use it so rarely that i could just subscribe when i want to watch anything, and unsubscribe immediately. This will enable subscription till end of billing period (one month). Then when i want o watch anything again then i will repeat again. And now kagi has implemented exactly this but automated from their own side. Im subscribing just to vote with my wallet.Hopes that netflix or any other provider will implement this are small though. Because it's free money when someone pays for service and does not use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42944371</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm strictly speaking never going to think of model distillation as "stealing." It goes against the spirit of scientific research, and besides every tech company has lost my permission to define what I think of as theft forever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found the discussion around inference scaling with the 'Wait' hack so surreal. The fact such an ingeniously simple method can impact performance makes me wonder how many low-hanging fruit we're still missing. So weird to think that improvements on a branch of computer science is boiling down to conjuring the right incantation words, how you even change your mindset to start thinking this way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels just like telling a constraint satisfaction engine to backtrack and find a more optimal route through the graph.  We saw this 25 years ago with engines like PROVERB doing directed backtracking, and with adversarial planning when automating competitive games.Why would you control the inference at the token level?  Wouldn’t the more obvious (and technically superior) place to control repeat analysis of the optimal path through the search space be in the inference engine itself?Doing it by saying “Wait” feels like fixing dad’s laptop over a phone call.  You’ll get there, but driving over and getting hands on is a more effective solution.  Realistically, I know that getting “hands on” with the underlying inference architecture is way beyond my own technical ability.  Maybe it’s not even feasible, like trying to fix a cold with brain surgery?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946854</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fresh, local eggs have remained around the same price here. While more expensive than eggs from large producers in normal times, they are now often cheaper.This is a great reminder of how important it is to support local farmers and small operations, which increase the resilience of the system as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of people suggesting to build chicken coop.
i have one, sure it's not much work. 2 minutes every day to grab the egg and bring the food and water, but then every 3 year you got to take the hatchet, grab each chicken, cut right on the neck and then hang it with it's feet while it's bleeding out and flapping its wings.then there are the few occasion where you miss with the hatchet and it cuts half its neck, its head hanging down, attached by a quarter of the neck from it's body with the blood jumping out and the chicken running in circle for quite a lot of time.it's also rare but sometimes even when you cut perfectly, the chicken will manage to get out of your hand and again you got to watch a headless chicken running in circle for some time.If you are the kind of animal loving people in city, i'm not sure it's worth it.bonus point, in summer you get a lot of fly because of the chicken shit, they reproduce in that. you can get in there and clean it everyday but it's a lot of work, and fly traps barely works when the heat is shinning strongly on the chicken shit. fly reproduce too damn quick.Also chicken have hierarchy where all the up top chicken will bite on the ass of the chicken under it, so if you are the top chicken you got a nice ass but the one at the bottom it has a bleedy ass and sometimes they manage to kill them.if you got to buy another chicken to replace it, it may not be accepted by the old one and so again -&gt; bottom hierarchy, death by ass biting lol. it's funny but it significantly decrease the economic worthiness when you got to replace you chicken once in a while.Beside i don't know what you do with chicken corpse in city, you aren't going to put it in recycling can.Support your local farmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been fiddling around with the Albertsons API for fun. It's kind of neat to see a whole year's worth of purchases in nicely formatted JSON.I have half an idea to create something like a personal inflation tracker, but I'm still thinking about it.It's entirely possible that these goons will start fiddling with official statistics around things like unemployment and inflation to tell us that inflation is not actually happening any more and that therefore we must cut interest rates, or some such.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42950929</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in fintech and we replaced an OCR vendor with Gemini at work for ingesting some PDFs. After trial and error with different models Gemini won because it was so darn easy to use and it worked with minimal effort. I think one shouldn't underestimate that multi-modal, large context window model in terms of ease-of-use. Ironically this vendor is the best known and most successful vendor for OCR'ing this specific type of PDF but many of our requests failed over to their human-in-the-loop process. Despite it not being their specialization switching to Gemini was a no-brainer after our testing. Processing time went from something like 12 minutes on average to 6s on average, accuracy was like 96% of that of the vendor and price was significantly cheaper. For the 4% inaccuracies a lot of them are things like the text "LLC" handwritten would get OCR'd as "IIC" which I would say is somewhat "fair". We probably could improve our prompt to clean up this data even further. Our prompt is currently very simple: "OCR this PDF into this format as specified by this json schema" and didn't require some fancy "prompt engineering" to contort out a result.Gemini developer experience was stupidly easy. Easy to add a file "part" to a prompt. Easy to focus on the main problem with weirdly high context window. Multi-modal so it handles a lot of issues for you (PDF image vs. PDF with data), etc. I can recommend it for the use case presented in this blog (ignoring the bounding boxes part)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is using exactly the wrong tools at every stage of the OCR pipeline, and the cost is astronomical as a result.You don't use multimodal models to extract a wall of text from an image. They hallucinate constantly the second you get past perfect 100% high-fidelity images.You use an object detection model trained on documents to find the bounding boxes of each document section as _images_; each bounding box comes with a confidence score for free.You then feed each box of text to a regular OCR model, also gives you a confidence score along with each prediction it makes.You feed each image box into a multimodal model to describe what the image is about.For tables, use a specialist model that does nothing but extract tables—models like GridFormer that aren't hyped to hell and back.You then stitch everything together in an XML file because Markdown is for human consumption.You now have everything extracted with flat XML markup for each category the object detection model knows about, along with multiple types of probability metadata for each bounding box, each letter, and each table cell.You can now start feeding this data programmatically into an LLM to do _text_ processing, where you use the XML to control what parts of the document you send to the LLM.You then get chunking with location data and confidence scores of every part of the document to put as meta data into the RAG store.I've build a system that read 500k pages _per day_ using the above completely locally on a machine that cost $20k.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are driving full speed into a xerox 2.0 moment and this time we are doing so knowingly. At least with xerox, the errors were out of place and easy to detect by a human. I wonder how many innocent people will lose their lives or be falsely incarcerated because of this. I wonder if we will adapt our systems and procedures to account for hallucinations and "85%" accuracy.And no, outlawing use the use of AI or increasing liability with its use will have next to nothing to deter its misuse and everyone knows it. My heart goes out to the remaining 15%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42952605</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of outrage fatigue, where constant exposure to distressing news can lead to emotional exhaustion and disengagement. It offers strategies for individuals to manage their media consumption, suggesting that cultivating awareness of emotional responses and establishing boundaries can help maintain engagement without overwhelming oneself. The piece emphasizes the importance of staying informed while also prioritizing mental well-being, ultimately encouraging readers to find a balanced approach to consuming news and participating in social issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Living in Poland ruled by trumpists for 8 years I have these experiences:- Get subscription of high value newspaper or magazine. Professionals work there, so you will get real facts, worthy opinions and less emotions.- It is better to not use social media. You never know if you are discussing with normal person, a political party troll, or Russian troll.- It is not worth discussing with „switched-on” people. They are getting high doses of emotional content, they are made to feel like victims, facts does not matter at all. Political beliefs are intermingled with religious beliefs.- emotional content is being treated with higher priority by brain, so it is better to stay away from it, or it will ruin your evening.- people are getting addicted to emotions and victimization, so after public broadcaster has been freed from it, around 5% people switched to private tv station to get their daily doses.- social media feels like a new kind of virus, we all need to get sick and develop some immunity to it.- in the end, there are more reasonable people, but democracies needs to develop better constitutional/law systems, with very short feedback loop. It is very important to have fast reaction on breaking the law by ruling regime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to consider for those of us who are more sensitive to online outrage is to just quit social media all together. I’m technically gen z and I’ve been off of social media (aside from HN, WhatsApp and discord) for years and you wouldn’t believe how great it’s been for my overall state of mind.Reddit, instagram, X, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Threads, etc are all the equivalent of digital junk food and I’d argue that we’re all a lot more negatively affected by it than we think. There’s a reason ‘brain rot’ was word of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't have outrage fatigue. Outrages are outrages and they are what they are. Are there many exaggerations and fake outrages? Sure. But things like the USA's current constitutional crisis are real.What I struggle with isn't fatigue at outrage, it's knowing what to do about it.I think violence is going to become more common, but I don't particularly think it will be effective.So less so than outrage, it's the feeling that we're trapped in a real life doom loop with no clear off ramp that I struggle with.I would like to do something... But what?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949277</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Old movies have been available on various "free ad-supported streaming television" for a while now, so I'm actually more surprised it took copyright holders that long to realize that Youtube also shows ads and doesn't require people to install some wonky app that might or might not be available for their platform.Of course, region-specific copyright deals are incredibly complex etc. etc., so I could imagine it was just a matter of waiting out until the last person putting up a veto retired or moved on to other things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Anyway, Waiting for Guffman still holds up, and you can watch it on YouTube, for free.On top of that it never was released outside of the US before! As a European fan of Spinal Tap I'm quite excited to finally be able to see this film.Also: no mention of The Mission, which is also in the list? That's quite a critically acclaimed one. Just look at these opening paragraphs from its wikipedia page:&gt; The Mission is a 1986 British historical drama film about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th-century South America.[4] Directed by Roland Joffé and written by Robert Bolt, the film stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi, and Liam Neeson.&gt; The film premiered in competition at the 39th Cannes Film Festival, winning the Palme d'Or. At the 59th Academy Awards it was nominated for seven awards including Best Picture and Best Director, winning for Best Cinematography. The film has also been cited as one of the greatest religious films of all time, appearing in the Vatican film list's "Religion" section and being number one on the Church Times' Top 50 Religious Films list.Oh, and the score is by a certain Ennio Morricone.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IpNXw6Y05M&amp;list=PL7Eup7JXSc...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mission_(1986_film)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a time fairly early in Netflix's streaming era when all the studios were just dumping their old back catalogs on Netflix to get some revenue from 'dead content' that I thought "Wow, someday soon pretty much all the old content will just be available on a central streaming service. The future will be good."Then the stock market started inflating the value of streamers because of ARR projections and studios adopted a gold rush mentality, pulled back all their content and each tried to launch their own service. Of course, this quickly fragmented the streaming market as few consumers would subscribe to more than one or two services at a time. As stock valuations dropped back to reality, the server plus bandwidth costs started piling up and the also-ran streaming services became break-even boat anchors for most studios.Now we're left with the cultural 'worst of all worlds'. A dozen inaccessible walled gardens each neglected by their owners and no easy, central way to find and watch an old, low-value film.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949181</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the model I get at gemini.google.com (i.e. through my Workspace subscription)? It says "Gemini Advanced" but there are no other details. No model selection option.I find the lack of clarity very frustrating. If I want to try Google's "best" model, should I be purchasing something? AI Studio seems focused around building an LLM wrapper app, but I just want something to answer my questions.Edit: what I've learned through Googling: (1) if you search "is gemini advanced included with workspace" you get an AI overview answer that seems to be incorrect, since they now include Gemini Advanced (?) with every workspace subscription.(2) a page exists telling you to buy the add-on (Gemini for Google Workspace), but clicking on it says this is no longer available because of the above. (3) gemini.google.com says "Gemini Advanced" (no idea which model) at the top, but gemini.google.com/advanced redirects me to what I have deduced is the consumer site (?) which tells me that Gemini Advanced is another $20/monthThe problem, Google PMs if you're reading this, is that the gemini.google.com page does not have ANY information about what is going on. What model is this? What are the limits? Do I get access to "Deep Research"? Does this subscription give me something in aistudio? What about code artifacts? The settings option tells me I can change to dark mode (thanks!).Edit 2: I decided to use aistudio.google.com since it has a dropdown for me on my workspace plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.&gt; Gemini 2.0, 2.0 Pro and 2.0 Pro Experimental, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite3 different ways of accessing the API, more than 5 different but extremely similarly named models. Benchmarks only comparing to their own models.Can't be more "Googley"!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried voice chat.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm convinced that using an embedded browser engine to render app UI is the future. Browser rendering engines are so powerful and versatile and universal I don't see how they can lose."But Electron!" Yes, Electron hasn't taken the world by storm because it has two huge deficiencies: 1. It takes an enormous amount of resources including ram and disk. 2. It has no native DOM API bindings so it takes even more ram and cpu to compile and run JS quickly.I'm excited for the new crop of browser engines because they could fix those deficiencies, opening up browser tech to app developers without hugely compromising the experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Servo's killer application would be a mobile-first browser for postmarketOS/Mobian/other mobile Linux distros. It's a weird vacuum because Firefox has its Android port, but when you run Firefox on small linux (touch)screen, the experience is very suboptimal. I'd call it unbearable if it wasn't for bunch of tweaks in form of https://gitlab.postmarketos.org/postmarketOS/mobile-config-f...Chrome is no better, as it has a very weird hardcoded minimum window width of 500px.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ladybird and Servo are exciting and much needed projects since Microsoft abandoned their own independent browser engine to use Chromium.If you didn't know you could see the massive progress both projects have made in web compatibility here: https://wpt.fyi/results/?label=master&amp;product=chrome&amp;product...As of today, browsers pass this percent of tests:  Chrome: 96.82%
  Firefox: 95.41%
  Safari: 94.97%
  Ladybird: 89.30%
  Servo: 78.61%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949390</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yesterday I was attempting to buy a product on a small retailer's website—as soon as I hit the "add to cart" button I got a message from Cloudflare: "Sorry, you have been blocked". My only recourse was to message the owner of the domain asking them to unblock me. Of course, I didn't, and decided to buy the product elsewhere. I wasn't doing anything suspicious.. using Arc on a M1 MBP; normal browsing habits.Not sure if this problem is common but; I would be pretty upset if I implemented Cloudflare and it started to inadvertently hurt my sales figures. I would hope the cost to retailers is trivial in this case, I guess the upside of blocking automated traffic can be quite great.Just checked again and I'm still blocked on the website. Hopefully this kind of thing gets sorted out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This echoes the user agent checking that was prevalent in past times. Websites would limit features and sometimes refuse to render for the "wrong" browser, even if that browser had the ability to display the website just fine. So browsers started pretending to be other browsers in their user agents. Case in point - my Chrome browser, running on an M3 mac, has the following user agent:"'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'"That means my browser is pretending to be Firefox AND Safari on an Intel chip.I don't know what features Cloudflare uses to determine what browser you're on, or if perhaps it's sophisticated enough to get past the user agent spoofing, but it's all rather funny and reminiscent just the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a website owner and VPN user I see both sides of this.On one hand, I get the annoying "Verify" box every time I use ChatGPT (and now due its popularity, DeepSeek as well).On the other hand, without Cloudflare I'd be seeing thousands of junk requests and hacking attempts everyday, people attempting credit card fraud, etc.I honestly don't know what the solution is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953508</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GNU make now has a load directive which lets you load up functions written in C    -load my_module.o

Your makefile can contain instructions to build my_module.o and they will be automatically triggered.For example you can create an equality test that works in an expression (ifeq can't be used as part of an expression obviously).   For example  FILENAME=file.$(if $(equals $(compression_level),0),tar,.tar.bz3)

The C for this function (without includes and export directives):  char *
  func_equals (const char *func_name, unsigned int argc, char **argv)
  {
      char *result = NULL;

      if (strcmp(argv[0], argv[1]) == 0) {
          result = gmk_alloc(strlen(argv[0]) + 1); /* not handling failure for simplicity */
          strcpy(result, argv[0]);
      }
    
      return result;
  }

This can be done with a macro but it's ugly and verbose.  Macros also slow makefile parsing a lot and for a large build like e.g. an operating system this makes a big difference - it's a penalty you pay every time you run "make" even if you only changed 1 file.There are plenty of things you cannot do with macros too. $(shell) is a getout card but it drastically slows down large makefiles.Your module has a setup function which gets called when it's loaded and this adds the function into gmake:  int
  equals_gmk_setup (const gmk_floc *flocp)
  {
      gmk_add_function ("equals", func_equals, 2, 2, GMK_FUNC_DEFAULT);
      return 1;
  }

Things that are hard/slow to do with macros like arithmetic - comparing, adding and so on are even better candidates.  A hash function is great for generating intermediate target names that aren't too long for the filesystem.My favorite one that I've done is embedding a python interpreter into make - this is very convenient as it's MUCH faster than running a process from $(shell) and it keeps state between uses which can be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve written a fair amount of Makefiles and bounced off of  cmake. Recently I’ve started using zig to build some C++ projects and will not be switching back.Having your build tool just be a library in a good general purpose language is the right move. Why use unergonomic hacks like the OP when you can use a sane language? My build.zig files have LSP completions and similar syntax (or the same) as what I’m building.I put make solidly in the pile of tools that are only still around because of network effects. We’d have switched to something better if it weren’t defacto installed by every distro and had to make justifications to sys admins to install alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have written some large build systems entirely in Make. More complex things tend to rely on templates, but you can build arbitrary things, with two main limitations:The error messages are awful, particularly if using templates. "Unexpected separator. Stop" is a classic, with no indication where in your 2k lines of Make it might be.You can't have file or folder names with spaces in (usually including any parent folder to where your code is checked out). A "list" in Make is a series of strings separated by spaces. There are various workarounds that people suggest, but none of them work consistently across platforms. You just have to avoid spaces. At least this is less bad since Windows stopped using "Documents and Settings" for "home" folders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42945146</guid></item><item><title>14.

We actually do large-scale manufacturing of industrial valves in the USA. But a lot of our prototyping involves working with Chinese suppliers and getting small batches of samples / prototypes / revisions sent in packages on airplanes.I literally do not know how the electrical and firmware engineers will do their jobs now if we cannot receive packages from China. It's going to halt all our R&amp;D  for at least 6 months while we onboard domestic contractor alternatives --- which will also just generally be shit. Not to mention the American contractors WONT BE ABLE TO SHIP IN THE FUCKING ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS FROM CHINA THEY NEED FOR THE PROTOTYPES.Every single R&amp;D department in the USA just got fuuuuuuuuucked by this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://about.usps.com/newsroom/service-alerts/international...Restored already.

The party of government doesn't like the post office, and this is to teach us not to like the post office either.I guess if they stopped using electric cars, they might like the post office again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42942405</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI a quick search shows that React has already integrated this on its main branch!https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32036I'm not exactly sure what the developer experience of this would be, but I expect it would make Portals significantly more powerful and able to be hot-swapped into different containers without disrupting either their internal state or even things like loaded iFrames. I expect others will be experimenting heavily with this now that there's platform support.https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12247 (2018-2020) describes some of the use cases, with one partial solution being https://github.com/httptoolkit/react-reverse-portal - the conversation around caveats of these approaches would be entirely different now!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;htmx has supported moveBefore() since 2.0.3 in October of last year:https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/CHANGELOG...https://htmx.org/examples/move-before/We initially asked for this new feature about two years ago and have worked with the Chrome team as they have implemented it.  It is going to be a huge step forward for the web!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest benefit to this is that it makes one of the slowest parts of virtual DOM diffing (longest common subsequence) no longer required. After this becomes supported in the mainstream, not even signal-based frameworks will have to include VDOM algorithms. I know this because I remember pushing for this to be supported a few years ago — a nice reminder that the standards are evolving and that nothing stops you from being a small part of the effort.Next up — DOM parts and standardized signals, unified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946718</guid></item><item><title>17.

It may be a good learning experience, but a terribly inefficient way of developing software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spent last year working on a side project and assumed I would need this and that in order to launch. But after it was ready to launch, I found out there was no product market fit. I have known about the importance of quickly finding out pmf but still made the mistakes. knowing != doing. We just love building stuff and mistakenly convince ourselves that if I add one more feature, this thing would be ready for launch and take off. But in reality...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember the moment when in my last startup, the first invoice was paid - $5. A magic moment. I still remember the name of the customer.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the book "Death, Society, and Human Experience" by Robert H. S. B. R. Wright, which explores the interplay between death and societal attitudes across different cultures and historical periods. It delves into how human experiences of mortality shape social structures, rituals, and cultural practices. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding death not just as an individual experience but as a collective societal phenomenon, encouraging readers to reflect on how perceptions of death influence various aspects of life and social identity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The Germans" is an absolutely jaw dropping read, a series of interviews with average German citizens and low-level nazi party members, conducted a decade or so after the war, by an American Jewish journalist. It shows, in first hand accounts, the banality of evil and how easily it can prevail if people do nothing. It is an account of modern tyranny and everyday collaboration. The parallels in the feeling of what's happened in American society, particularly the silence, confusion and cowering now of anyone who should oppose a hostile takeover and dismantling of our democracy and our laws, are striking. It should have been required reading in American schools, when there was still time to educate people against these dangers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;President is unilaterally shutting down federal agencies. If this goes on there really isn't a constitution anymore, not in practice anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make matters worse, this is not only "rehappening" in the US.

&lt;p&gt;The page discusses Amb Sheets, a tool developed by Ink and Switch that combines the benefits of digital and analog note-taking. It allows users to create and organize notes through a unique, flexible interface that resembles traditional paper, while also incorporating digital features for easy access and sharing. The tool is designed to enhance creativity and productivity by providing an adaptable workspace that mimics the fluidity of physical note-taking, making it suitable for both individual and collaborative use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ideas and prototypes coming out of inkandswitch are really interesting.It feels like user interface innovations all stopped/stagnated in the early 2000s and we've just spent the last 20 years adjusting the previous 20 years of desktop UI paradigms to the mobile and tablet space.It's great to see people still working on interesting problems like this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting, for sure, but I'm not buying that this is much better than just setting up some extra columns. The two arguments presented against extra columns are 1) editing time and 2) space.1) Editing can be sped up, albeit with a learning curve, so maybe I can see that one. At least at my proficiency, I doubt I'd be saving any material amount of time. I can think of scenarios where this would actually be slower for me. People with less experience in spreadsheets might find some time savings, it's hard for me to gauge that.2) Space, on the other hand, I'm not really buying. You replace extra columns with a wider column and a bespoke UI piece on the right-hand side. I can see columns A:H in the column example, and columns A:B in the final Ambsheet example (which, funny enough, is displayed as a 2x3 spreadsheet -- why not just have those 6 cells right in the sheet?).This also seems much more difficult to do visualizations from. Graphs, conditional formatting, etc. But that part isn't discussed, so there may be a solution for that which isn't shown.It's interesting enough that I would enjoy playing around with it. I very well could just be entrenched in my habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This does a clever job of dealing with the multiple varied inputs to a scenario.A real budgeting scenario might have 2 * 3 * 7 * 4 * 5 * 3 * 9 * 2 * 5 = 226,800 possible outcomes, so the obvious question is what UI do you use to consider/narrow down that beast?  You need tools that let you slice and dice that output based on different sets of criteria.The simplest might be something like, "rule out all solutions that total more than $5000" but you also need things like "I will only pay for a total of 3 streaming services, rule out all scenarios with more than that" and "if I choose not to have a car, then I have to get a transit pass and an e-scooter"I almost feel like, as clever as this is, the harder problem is the one I describe above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42941143</guid></item><item><title>21. 20k federal workers take "buyout" so far, official says</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/02/04/trump-buyout-federal-workers-20000</link><description>

So there's a very real chance at this deal offering something closer to ~1 month of pay before it suddenly gets dropped due to budget negotiations.It would be an incredibly generous and nice buyout package, but obviously if it gets torn up after a month it's not that great of a deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The buyout offer entitles federal employees to stop working more or less immediately and continue to be paid through Sept. 30.&gt; The federal workforce's normal attrition rate is about 6% a year, meaning some of those who've taken the buyout may have been planning to leave government service anyway.Wow, talk about an amazing deal if you already happened to be planning on leaving...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always found this approach of reducing the number of employees unwise from the company perspective (but pretty good for the employees, though).While the unsatisfied employees are the target, my observations indicate that a high percentage of active and skilled people are willing to take this offer, as they are sure that they will find a new place within a reasonable time, so it's basically, free money. And those are the people that the company should try to keep as much as it could. 
While the "give me a task with the perfect description, and I will do it" folks will stay until they are kicked out, as, usually, they are not up to taking the initiative.That's why I saw how the companies that were changing the rules in the process: "well, it's an offer, but your manager needs to approve that first", and other tricks to be able to reject it for the top performers. Needless to say, it leads to the bad moral.However, the companies I'm mentioning had way fewer employees than the federal workforce, so the chances are that with that size it's impossible to do it the "right" way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42950790</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you also feel like you did projects in your teen years that you wouldn't pull off today?I coded assembly (Z80) in a disk editor, having no assembler, just a handwritten list of opcodes.I wrote a chat client app (in Delphi) HAVING NO INTERNET at home, I went to a cafe, recorded a dump with Wireshark, printed it on a dot matrix printer, and used a marker pen to highlight the bytes I understand the meaning of.I miss it so much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jaw droppingly awesome :)Brings up a strong nostalgia from me.  Around that time computers were becoming mainstream and available where I was in the UK, and I grew up acquiring old cast-off computers and tinkering.  For me there was an 'assembly language masterclass' book (I was a beginner and this was my first serious tech book and I had to sink or swim) that went into a lot of 32-bit programming for the 386 (which I never had) but got me far enough along.  It was that and computer magazines which were really programming magazines, which were a thing and quite popular back then.Remember fondly how transformative it was to move from Basic to a copy of Turbo Pascal 6 and it's asm keyword that I got passed on a floppy disk in the playground.Ah that was the time when it was just obvious that you could entertain yourself on a computer by creating things, however small, instead of just consuming them.By the time I got computer games, I was thinking about them as programs not games and I got my entertainment by getting into the modding scene.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved reading this write-up. It was a wonderful trip down memory lane. Writing a PASCAL compiler is very impressive. I only got as far as the assembler!In 1989 I designed and built a board with 3 transputers on it as part of my (physics) degree project. The transputers were T212 I think, so only 16 bit and no floating point with 2k of local RAM. They ran at 20 Mhz and the all important chip to chip network ran at 10 Mhz. Ostensibly it was so I could do Ising spin simulations on it but actually all I wanted to do was calculate Mandelbrot sets having seen a demo of a box with 256 transputers in doing that.My transputer box was connected to a BBC Micro and to program the transputer I wrote an assembler in BBC Basic. The transputer instruction set was quite funky - everything was variable length. Which meant when calculating the jump instructions, sometimes my assembler would take 7 passes to find the optimium encoding for everything.The BBC Micro only had 32k of RAM which wasn't nearly enough RAM to hold the assembler, the symbol table and the code you were assembling. So the assembler would write each pass to disk! To floppy disk! It was very slow as you can imagine but I did end up writing both an Ising spin simulation and a Mandelbrot set plotter. The Ising spin simulator ran slightly faster than a FORTRAN version I wrote for the university mainframe which I was very pleased with.I got to learn about parallel processing using message passing and managed to make my first concurrency bug where the program would work on 1, 2 but not 3 transputers! I didn't write programs for multi-processor machines again for more than 10 years.The transputer seems so ahead of its time, even now 36 years later. I sometimes wonder what it would be like if we'd continued down that path. Maybe your laptop would have 10,000 processors in it each with a few MB of RAM and we'd be writing very different programs in languages where message passing was a first class construct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42944108</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses lessons learned from implementing Okta's use of bcrypt in API design, emphasizing the importance of security, performance, and developer experience. It highlights best practices for handling sensitive data, particularly through the use of strong password hashing, while also addressing potential pitfalls such as managing complexity and ensuring maintainability in code. The author shares insights on optimizing API interactions and the balance between usability and security, encouraging developers to adopt robust methods for protecting user information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bcrypt is a password hash, not a KDF, which is the way it was used in this API. It's super unclear to me why they wanted a string-based KDF here at all; does anyone have more context?I've in the past been annoying about saying I think we should just call all password hashes "KDFs", but here's a really good illustration of why I was definitely wrong about that. A KDF is a generally-useful bit of cryptography joinery; a password hash has exactly one job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see the incident was a jumping off point to talk about bad APIs (bcrypt probably should error &gt;72) but it sounds like the actual bug was they weren't checking the value in the cache matched the data they used in the hash for the key. The authentication cache check should survive any arbitrarily bad hashing algorithm because all of them are going to have collisions (pigeonhole principal). Even an arbitrarily 'strong' hash function with no input truncation, as long as it has a fixed width result, will have this property. Thus, any arguing in the comments here about different hash functions with different truncation properties is moot.The analogy is something like creating a hash map whose insert function computes the slot for the key and unconditionally puts the value there instead of checking if the keys are the same during a collision. No amount of tinkering with the hash function fixes this problem. The algorithm is wrong. A hashmap should survive and be correct even giving it a hash function that always returns 4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold on, in the Rust example, how does `err_on_truncation` get set? TFA completely ignored that there's a setting somewhere (probably incorrectly defaulting to false)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42955176</guid></item><item><title>24.

I don't know what you're talking about but I work in a corporate environment where we can't use JS but we can use SVG images... As a consequence I end up creating graphics in illustrator, exporting to SVG and then hand animating them with CSS animations.I wouldn't recommend doing it my way, but for path animations they are likely animating the stroke length. Here is an example that might help, but use an animation tool if you can.https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/One thing of note with stroke animations.. if you transition to/from negative numbers the animation breaks in Safari (negative numbers are out of spec aparently). There is a work around but I can't remember it at the moment, it results in the stroke animation playing in reverse though.As mentioned above, if you can use a JS library, use one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42926359</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first step to becoming anything - an artist, a programmer, a fit dude - is falling in love with the process, or at least developing the discipline to practice regularly. I heard from gym people that just being at the gym free regularly without even doing anything there is a better first step than going all out once then never going again.In a similar vein there is a wonderful video essay called The Toolbox Fallacy. It's about how people fancy themselves artists and keep delaying the things that would make them an artist. They wait for the right degree, the right tools, the right breakthrough. In the end, painting is what makes a painter, not collecting paintbrushes.I could only apply this advice when I accepted that the output of my work would suck for a while. I went to sketching sessions and sketched wildly deformed bodies. But damn it I was drawing. Same with blogging, and with talking to strangers.In the words of a cartoon dog, "sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something". While most wisdom is gained as you age, this one is progressively lost. We lose the ability to play, and the willingness to fail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; With the body it is almost always use it or lose it.It is wild how intense this effect is. Last year, I broke my ankle. I couldn't use that leg at all. Within two months, almost all of the muscle in that calf was gone. Just eight weeks and while one leg still looked normal and the other was a stick. Even the flesh that was still there was soft and spongy.When I got an X-ray later, the surgeon said I had the bones of an 80-year-old in that leg. All the bone density, just gone.It's crazy how rapidly a human body will cannibalize itself if you don't use something. From what I've heard, this is an evolutionary adaptation unique to humans. Most other animals just have the muscles they have regardless of use. But, perhaps because we went through a narrow population window during the Ice Age, we've evolved this ability to harvest our own resources to survive.Probably great for not starving to death, but a real bummer if you're trying to be fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Nobody says we have to be good at everything we doThis is advice I have to push on my kids constantly, because they are obsessed with finding that one thing they are better than everyone else in the world."Do some" is not advice I got as a kid, but my mom eventually figured it out and told me that when was in my mid 20s or something.Her words (from Malayalam) are best translated as "For whom a little is not enough, nothing is ever enough".I think that's true for everything from money to self-worth. Enough is too hard to have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42905900</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used, and am still using, Julia for my PhD research. It's perfect for parallel/distributed computing, and the neural network primitives are more than enough for my purposes. Anything I write in pure julia runs really, really fast, and has great profiling tools to improve performance further.Julia also integrates with python, with stuff like PythonCall.jl. I've gotten everything to work so far, but it hasn't been smooth. The python code is always the major bottleneck though, so I try to avoid it.Overall, julia is a significantly better language in every single aspect except for ecosystem and the occassional environment issue, which you'll get with conda often anyways. It's really a shame that practically nobody actually cares about it compared to python. It supports multi-dimensional arrays as a first-class citizen, which means that each package doesn't have it's own array like torch, numpy, etc, and you don't have to constantly convert between the types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone working with it day to day, coming from around 18 years of mostly python, I wish I could say my experience has been great. I find myself constantly battling with the JIT and compilation and recompilation and waiting around all the time (sometimes 10 to 15 minutes for some large projects). Widespread macro usage makes stack traces much harder to read. Lack of formal interfaces means a lot of static checking is not practical. Pkg.jl is also not great, version compatibility is kind of tacked on and has odd behavior.Obviously there are real bright spots too, with speed, multiple dispatch, a relatively flourishing ecosystem, but overall I wouldn't pick it up for something new if given the choice. I'd use Jax or C++ extensions for performance and settle on python for high level, despite its obvious warts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a MATLAB and Python user who has flirted with julia as a replacement. I don't love the business model of JuliaHub, which feels very similar to Mathworks in that all the cool toolboxes are gated behind a 'contact sales' or high priced license. The free 20 hours of cloud usage is a non-starter. Also it seems that by default, all JuliaHub usage is default cloud-based? on-prem and airgapped (something I need) is implied to be $$$.Open sourcing and maintaining some components of things like JuliaSim or JuliaSim Control might expand adoption of Julia for people like me. I will never be able to convince my company to pay for JuliaHub if their pricing is similar to Mathworks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42915786</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most important thing to know is that Go slices are exactly how you would implement a dynamically growable slice in C if I asked you to. No less, but importantly, no more: a pointer to a piece of memory, and a current length and capacity.The classic slice mistake is to forget that append doesn't necessarily return a completely new slice backed by a disjoint piece of memory, especially easy if you've been using a language where variables are immutable by default.The problem is that it will often accidentally work; if you over-run the backing store, you will get a new piece of memory:    a := make([]int, 1, 1) // a is backed by a one-element-long piece of memory
    a[0] = 42
    b := append(a, 17) // this must allocate a new piece of memory
    c := append(a, 37) // this must also allocate a new piece of memory

    // At this point a == [42], b == [42, 17], c == [42, 37]

The problem is when the existing capacity is sufficient:    a := make([]int, 1, 10) // a is backed by a ten-element-long piece of memory
    a[0] = 42
    b := append(a, 17) // no need to allocate: just use the existing memory
    c := append(a, 37) // no need to allocate: just (re)use the existing memory

    // At this point a == [42], b == [42, 37], c == [42, 37]
    //                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it’s a good read, but i think it should focus more on some of the common mistakes that people make when slicing a slice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2009)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946232</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces a hexagonal tiled cartogram designed to visualize U.S. county populations in a more intuitive manner. By replacing traditional square or rectangular representations with hexagons, the cartogram aims to reduce distortion and improve clarity in understanding population distribution and density across different counties. The author discusses the methodology behind creating the hexagonal format, its advantages over conventional maps, and its potential applications in data analysis and policy-making. The piece highlights the importance of effective visual representation in conveying complex demographic information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a cartographer or any type of a data visualization expert, but isn't the advantage of the hexagon map - the fact that it "highlights trends that are often masked by the geographical quirks of actual state boundaries" per the article - negated by hexagon county maps?For example, California has 58 counties, but Kentucky has 120. That means that the "resolution" of the data in California is half as accurate as the data in Kentucky despite having ten times as many inhabitants and 4 times the land area.Basically, by switching to hexagon county maps, aren't we actually amplifying the problem that hexagon state maps try to solve and making it worse, not better?(A good article and good examples OP but I just don't personally see how the hexagon county map is an improvement, but again I am not an expert in this field)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool, that's an interesting and useful visualization. I work in infectious disease forecasting, and I wanted to give it a try already. However, the csv columns are 
`State,County Name,x,y,Color,...,Largest City,County Full,State Full`
whereas our US model outputs are expressed using census geoids[1] (5-digits for county), and I believe that would also be the case for other potential users. In that case one would need to merge with the county dataframe[2][1] https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/g...
[2] https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/natio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A county like San Francisco or New York, which packs thousands of residents into a small area, now stands out with an intense color saturation, drawing the eye immediately to where the people actually are. Conversely, a vast county with a sparse population adopts a lighter tone, accurately reflecting its lower density without the distraction of an oversized area.That sounds great, but this colour scheme doesn't seem to be what was actually used on the map.If I know anything about the US population density, the gradient used is dark blue -&gt; light blue -&gt; light pink -&gt; red, so the "vast counties with sparse population" actually show up as saturated as the dense urban ones.The most visually attractive areas on that map are the large dark blue areas of West Texas and the Rockies, the opposite of the intention described in the text.I would recommend using a single colour gradient instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42943271</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The website offers information about "MTR" (more than a recycling analysis), a tool designed to analyze and improve the recycling processes of products and materials. It provides insights into waste management, helping organizations to increase recycling rates and reduce environmental impact. The site emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in sustainability efforts and outlines the features and benefits of using the MTR tool, including tracking metrics, optimizing recycling strategies, and enhancing compliance with regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I normally have `mtr 1.1`¹ running in the background, in the third display mode, which is a 2D histogram—time in the x axis, hops in the y axis, and ASCII character/colour for ping time. When problems occur, this tends to let you easily see the nature of the problem—total loss, elevated packet loss, elevated response times; and to see the location of the problem—local network, local ISP, public internet. There are definitely occasions for loss%, sent, last/average/best/worst/stddev ping and such things as are found in the first display mode, but most of the time I find the histogram view most useful as the starting point.You can make mtr start in this view with --displaymode=2 (direct command line arguments, `mtr --displaymode=2 …`; or shell alias, `alias mtr="mtr --displaymode=2"`; or set environment variable MTR_OPTIONS=--displaymode=2).Screenshot of this mode: https://temp.chrismorgan.info/2025-02-06-hn-42924182-mtr-dis...—⁂—¹ 1.1 = 1.0.0.1 = Cloudflare public DNS, a convenient nearby public internet endpoint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MTR is a useful tool but it is a somewhat common source of illusory issues since it generates so many icmp time exceeded packets that routers stop replying to other folks running traces. It's important, as others said, to understand that these aren't testing the data path of a network but instead the control plane path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MTR has long been one of the first little tools that I install on workstations.    sudo apt install mtr-tiny

I also have a hotkey to pop it up in a window, pinging to some host that'll always be somewhere on the other side of any ISP from me.  Whenever I suddenly suspect a networking problem from my laptop, I hit the hotkey as the first troubleshooting step.  MTR starts to narrow down a few different problems very quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42924182</guid></item><item><title>34.

Whatever we build has to let people disagree, but amplify the cases where they agree so that we can find what's actionable, not what's engaging.  Web 2 and 3 have failed so far to get that right.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of prediction games, where participants make predictions about uncertain outcomes, such as sports events or political elections, and receive feedback based on accuracy. It explores the mechanics of these games, how they can be used for collective decision-making, and the impact of scoring systems on player engagement and performance. The author also emphasizes the educational potential of prediction games in enhancing understanding of probability and statistical reasoning. Overall, the piece aims to provide insights into the design and functionality of prediction games and their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a hard time keeping up with the literature on this and it's not exactly my area of research, but the "overfitting is ok" always seemed off and handwavy to me. It violates some pretty basic information-theoretic literature, for one thing.I guess it seems like parameters need to be "counted" differently or there's something misunderstood about what a parameter is, or whether and how it's being adjusted for somewhere. Some of the gradient descent literature I've read, makes it seem like there are sometimes adjustments for parameters as part of the optimization process, so talking about "overfitting doesn't mean anything" is misleading.It just seems like something where there's a lot of imprecision in terms that is critically important, no definitive explanations for anything, and so forth.The results are the results, but then again we have hallucinations and weird adversarial probe glitches suggestive of overfitting (see also e.g., http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/rice20a). I might even suggest the definition of overfitting in a DL context has been poorly operationalized. Sure you can have a training and a test set, but if the test set isn't sufficiently differentiated from the training set, are you going to identify overfitting? I can take training and test sets with a traditional statistical model and if I define the test set a certain way, minimize overfitting results.I guess I just feel like a lot of overfitting discussions tend to feel kind of handwavy or misleading and I wish they were different. The number of parameters has never really been the correct metric when talking about overfitting, it just happens to align nicely with the correct metric in conventional models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently read another great post by the same author about the connection between optimisation with constraints and backpropagation algorithm https://archives.argmin.net/2016/05/18/mates-of-costate/ Apparently based on older LeCun's paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many $1 million prizes were given out?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42950066</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has removed the official bypass tool that allowed unsupported PCs to install Windows 11 by circumventing the requirement for TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module). This action follows the company's ongoing efforts to enforce hardware compatibility for its operating system, solidifying its focus on security and improved performance. Users who previously utilized the workaround may now face challenges when attempting to install or update Windows 11 on non-compliant devices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 11 looks like the perfect reason to give UNIX-based systems another try. Literally the only thing that's kept me hooked to Windows are the Office apps. They're baked into so many of my workflows, from creating simple graphics to doing my personal finances, and of course plenty of legacy documents that I'd like to continue being able to use. They're really Windows-native I've found, even the official versions for iOS seem to be missing some features (last time I checked was in the past year, and I couldn't find some paragraph-level formatting options I wanted in Word, eg). Google Docs seem like a different product, they apparently have great APIs, but the "click-based" features are no match. It's been ages since I tried LibreOffice, but it was no match back then either.I'm thinking, either I need to get used to different workflows or just try virtualization. I heard Figma is great for presentations, anything that Excel can do where the alternatives are lacking is probably better done in R/Python anyway, but for Word I don't see an alternative. No way I'll use LaTeX for all my writing, and anything Markdown-based just won't cut it formatting-wise. Or just use something like Wine I guess. Anyone facing a similar situation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is Microsoft hoping to accomplish here? Given the rate of adoption of Windows 11, it seems unlikely that a majority of Windows 10 users will replace their hardware between now and October. It also seems to me that the scenario where a majority of PC users are running an unsupported Windows release is likely to create MS more problems than is offset by potential revenue from a hardware refresh cycle. Is there an ulterior motive at play beyond wanting to create a hardware refresh cycle?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a bootable bypass .iso for this (and for the million other bits of anti-user behavior that MS has pulled, and will keep pulling):https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42947049</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Google has removed its previous pledge not to use artificial intelligence for military weapons from its website, signaling a shift in its stance toward the use of AI in defense. Originally established in 2018, the commitment aimed to address ethical concerns surrounding AI technology in warfare. The removal of this pledge raises questions about the company's future direction and its involvement in military applications, especially amid ongoing discussions about the ethical implications of AI in combat and its potential impact on global security.&lt;/p&gt;

This move is part of the agency's effort to ensure that internal communications are kept confidential and to streamline record-keeping processes, which raises concerns about transparency and accountability within the agency. The article highlights the implications of this shift for employee communication and the potential impact on public access to information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;DOGE is obviously a completely illegal operation, and I really do hope it will be get reined in before they can cause an issue so big that _even trump's croniest cronies_ have to admit what is going on.For someone who claims to love freedom of speech, Elon is pretty quick to determine who can say what, and how much access to _his_ data people have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practically, this probably doesn't make a difference. FOIA relies on at least one person in the department to not be antagonistic towards the process. Otherwise they can just make up excuses. That's the standard experience for people sending requests.I don't think anyone from the new DOGE would actually be helpful in responses anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title here is poor. Its not that Slack is subject to FOIA and other systems are not - its that the org structure of DOGE is being transition from being under OMB to directly under the executive office. If they use Slack there it would be presumably not be subject to FOIA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42951458</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilarious post. I recommend people read to the end&gt; If Jeffries started with a different core representation, then it's likely his subsequent design decisions would also change. The bookkeeping for constraint propagation might push him towards Norvig's relational approach to the rules of Sudoku; rather than continually recomputing the rows, columns, and boxes, he could simply have a map of each cell onto its peers. He could distill every lesson of the previous posts, creating something simpler and faster.&gt; But Jeffries isn't in the business of starting over. He not only believes in incremental design, but in using the smallest possible increments. In his posts, he regularly returns to GeePaw Hill's maxim of "many more much smaller steps." He is only interested in designs that are reachable through a series of small, discrete steps.Jeffries has radicalized me. This sort of puttering-around with "incremental design" is too pervasive in the corporate world. In software we have the luxury of rethinking from first principles, and we must use it. Death to MMMSS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article. For me, this is the fundamental concept:&gt; Both Norvig and Jeffries are genre programmers; they have spent most of their career solving a specific kind of problem. And that problem, inevitably, lends itself to a particular kind of solution.I wish more people would be circumspect about the genre of problem they're trying to solve and how their framing railroads them into a particular type of solution that might have a better method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is interesting to basically critique a series of blog posts like its a film.But re: design vs. increment, I do think incremental TDD is pretty useful in domains where you have low confidence that you could come up with a good design. If you asked me to implement an LLM today, 0% I could design a good one. But given enough time I could slowly start to implement one (maybe?).The two quotes that got me areJeffries:&gt; So I try to make small decisions, simple decisions, decisions that will be easy to change when, not if, a better idea comes along.Norvig, about Jeffries:&gt; He didn't know that so he was sort of blundering in the dark even though all his code "worked" because he had all these test cases.I fear someone could say this about me, about almost everything I've ever built. I guess something like "I just kept crawling and it just kept working!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953168</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to properly store and dry 3D printing filament to enhance its longevity and performance. It discusses the impact of moisture on filament quality, suggests various storage solutions like sealed containers and desiccants, and offers methods for drying filament, including using an oven or a dedicated filament dryer. The guide emphasizes the importance of maintaining optimal storage conditions to prevent issues like clogs and poor print quality, making it essential for anyone involved in 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It all depends of your location and the filament. I had PLA from 2018 that printed flawlessly last year and I had new, sealed PLA and PTEG spools that were brittle or printed a stringy mess unless they spent a night on the drier. The problem comes because there are so much variety and no way to know for the consumer what the composition of each filament is. It does not seem to have much to do with price. This inconsistency across manufacturers, filament types, colors and batches is why people have favorite brands they stick with to minimize the risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a cheap toaster oven I keep in the garage for drying my desiccant. I just can't bring myself to use anything I'd prepare food in.I do try to store everything in 4L cereal boxes (often with desiccant), or gallon zip-lock bags. It seems that air circulation is preferable to vacuum sealed if you're using desiccant:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOHq5kbtlYgI will say that even in my humid environment (Houston), I seem to have no issues with PLA. PETG and TPU (I don't really use any other filaments yet) absolutely require drying (I have a Sunlu S4, which works well)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What i do, is store all spools in a big sealed plastic tote with some bigger desiccant bags(100g). 
To dry the filament(even if it's new from a sealed bag) i have a smaller plastic tote that will fit 1 spool with a heating pad(like the ones used for your medical purposes) on the bottom. Add the spool and let it sit fro 6-12 hours on top of the heating pad with the lid closed. Pretty cheap heated filament dryer.
Here's the heating pad i use, can be found on Amazon for $14: "Boncare® Small Heating Pad Without Auto Shut Off for Cramps and Back Pain Relief"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42903107</guid></item><item><title>47.

If it stays there, it shouldn't have a "returning" animation. Otherwise, it's an interesting puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool idea, and very well implemented. My only feedback is that you should clarify whether the solution has to be a valid position that can be reached in a chess game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949019</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think about cones all the time when doing machine learning. If I have an object O that can be mapped to A and B I can learn a function from A to B or B to A if I can generate Os. That’s my view of self supervised learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, learning about the categorical structure is interesting, but is there a specific advantage to seeing these concepts directly informing the implementation vs as a post-hoc way of explaining what autodiff is doing? E.g. Tensorflow is creating and transforming graphs of computation. Despite being written before most of the categorical work cited was done, isn't it doing the "same" thing, but we just wouldn't find names or comments in the code that closely align with the categorical work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare to the XLA's ability to compile full training steps from JAX?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42915901</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a breakthrough by scientists at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, who have developed a technique to identify Earth-like planets and their potential to support life. This method involves detecting the biosignatures, or indicators of life, that could signify the presence of biological processes on distant worlds. The research aims to enhance our understanding of life in the universe and to guide future searches for extraterrestrial life, showcasing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in the scientific quest to explore other planets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The actual paper is here, in PDF form:  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ada3c7/...The authors write that Earth could detect an Earthlike planet from 12000 light-years away via Earth's strong radio emissions -- specifically, the intermittent, celestially targeted radar beams (for example, those originally from Arecibo’s planetary radar).But we'd need to be laser-focused on the planet, and we'd need to catch them when they're emitting.Earth has only been emitting powerful radio waves for ~50 years, so our detection radius is ~50 LY.Besides radio, most other means have a very low range.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm so glad that someone has finally tried to answer this question as it's something I've been wondering for years. It's interesting that atmospheric indicators are only detectable to around 5ly as that is I believe one of the primary methods we are using to look for technosignatures on other planets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems like they're calculating the farthest distances where it would be theoretically possible for aliens with Earth level tech to detect us, for various different ways of detection. I'm curious about a related question: At what distance would we likely have been able to detect 'ourselves' with current technology? Ie. if there was another Earth 100 or 1000 light years away, would we have seen it by now? (Assume they are x years ahead so the signals have had time to propagate).I think it may be a relatively short distance, which could have implications for resolving the Fermi paradox, but I haven't seen any definitive estimates &amp; I'm curious to learn more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42923409</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Zig and I love that it’s getting attention, but can someone convince me of its memory safety? One thing that surprised me is that returning pointers to stack-allocated memory doesn’t cause a compiler error — it just segfaults at runtime. This has been an open issue since 2019 [#1].That, along with the number of memory-related issues in one of Zig’s most popular project, Bun.js [#2], gives me pause.[#1]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2646[#2]: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues?q=is%3Aissue+segfault&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it is not a popular view, but I really hope Zig becomes as stable in language design as C.  I am tried of language design as an endless project of 'change because we can'.I switched from objective-c to swift thinking job done, and felt like I was learning a new language with each new version.  I ended up switching back to objective-c.I think Java had a good start by defining a solid language spec (JLS) up front, which was a bible during the rapid standard library expansion days, but the JVM stayed stable at least.I left Golang behind because of the same academic churn in language design that I saw in Swift.So at the moment I really love coding in Zig.  It already does everything I need it too already, and anyway I cant upgrade past 0.8.1 because 'old mac', and wont run on Asahi M1 because 'new mac'.  But I assume in trying to be a good C replacement, these are temporary limitations, especially now it can self compile.What I really enjoy is that I can use it for very lightweight WASM / web front-end stuff, and at the other end of the client scale, I am using it for some SOC programming on the PinePhone.  I know C has the same reach, but my days of looking up ** semantics in K&amp;R are long past!Hopefully we'll get a solid language spec soon, and the language changes will slow to a crawl once 1.0 approaches.  As for the lacking documentation that is always a complaint, I'll hopefully try to contribute to that when I start my new Zig project in May.Anyway respect and thanks to Andrew and the team for all the hard work they are doing.  It is an amazing project and I hope it works out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI - it's not the official guide nor documentation.It should be better noted on this website, but this is not the official Zig guide - which can be found here: https://ziglang.org/learn/(And while yes, Zig does make reference to zig.guide because it's very helpful and people appreciate the effort put into it - but it's still under the other online learning resource section, not official documentation section)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953206</guid></item><item><title>1.

I'd like to see a game like this where "giving it away" is part of the game. Something you can pass around a school or a con. Like an analog version of Chain World, which was a mini-Minecraft-on-a-USB-stick that you were supposed to pass on. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_World )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Found these a couple weeks ago and bought the golf PDF for my &lt;7y/o nephew and he was initially hesitant but then thrilled once he understood the basic premise.

Now people have become so alienated from the paper that someone has brought their computer todo to the paper :))))Not only this does not promote the paper, but is a huge promotion for the computer! By being a constant reminder to the notebook's owner: "this is not a computer", one will have no choice but to keep thinking of all the things they miss in their todo from a dynamic medium :))))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960144</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would argue that 6502 is a bad first ISA to learn if you want learn assembly. You‘ll spend most of your time fighting the quirks of this clever, but deeply flawed architecture. The idioms you learn to work around them don‘t translate to any better designed architecture that wasn‘t constrained by the tools and budget available to MOS at the time.If you want to learn a small, yet powerful instruction set with a few quirks go for ARM v6M. It‘s still in meaningful production (no the Monster 6502 doesn‘t count), has good platform support in the latest open source toolchains (debuggers, compilers, assemblers, linkers, etc.).If you value openness of the architecture enough to deal with a less mature platform (as of early 2025) then pick a RISC-V MCU instead. If you can‘t decide pick a RP2350 :-).The ARMv6M instruction set is small and no loading constants doesn‘t require long winded instruction sequences if you do it as documented (PC-relative load instead of shifting in immediate data). You don‘t have to deal with self modifying code and/or the zero page to index memory. Your registers are the same width as the address space. Yes it‘s 32 bits, but that makes it simpler to learn, use and teach than all 8/16 bit and most 16 bit instruction sets I’ve seen because you don‘t have to work around to narrow registers for common operations. To anyone who thinks this sounds boring: don‘t worry ARMv6 still has enough quirks you can use for code golfing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cannot agree that the simplicity of the 6502 wins over the 68000.The 68000 has more registers and wider data types: but the registers are all uniformly the same. It's really just two registers A and D, copied a bunch of times in to D0 to D7, and A0 to A7.  Whatever you can do with D0 can be done with D3 and so on. Some A's are dedicated, like for a stack pointer.Simplicity of structure has to be balanced with simplicity of programming.It's not that easy to program the 6502, because in moderately complex programs, you're constantly running into its limitations.The best way to learn how to hack around the limitations of a tiny machine is to completely ignore them and become a seasoned software engineer. A seasoned engineer will read the instruction set manual in one setting, and other pertinent documents, and the clever hacks will start brewing in their head.You don't have to start with tiny systems to get this skill. When you're new, you don't have the maturity for that; get something that's a bit easier to program with more addressing modes and easier handling of larger arrays, more registers, wider integers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has been teaching assembly to undergrads for many years, I have a couple of things to say about this. First of all, I agree. The 6502 is great for beginners but that is not just merit of the 6502 language and I want to explain why.I have taught 68K, MIPS, ARM, x86, etc., and the overall good student feedback I got by teaching 6502 is mostly because of the surrounding context that comes with the CPU. The reason 6502 clicked better than other modern alternatives (MIPS, ARM, x86, etc.) was because we use it to program a real machine that is simple to understand (i.e. Nintendo Entertainment System). Rudimentary memory mapped IO, no operating system, no pipelined instructions, no delay slots, no network, no extra noise, ...it's just a simple box with a a clock inside, a CPU, some memory addresses, some helper chips, IO mapped to memory addresses, and that's pretty much it!!! So, even though I agree that the 6502 is not the simplest instruction set out there, THIS simplicity of the system helped a lot.And about the limitations of the 6502 CPU, these limitations were also important for students to understand that these instructions have a reason to be the way they are. CPUs were designed and wired given the constraints of that time, and that reflects on how we programmed for them.So, even thought this was mostly empirical, I have to say picking 6502 and the NES to teach beginners was successful. Once again, not really because it was the 6502, but because the 6502 forced us to go simple in terms of the sytem we were moving bits left and right.Once students played around with the 6502 and saw NES tiles moving on the screen, then it was super cool to evolve and show them how the 68000 did things differently, and then evolve more and show how MIPS came, show how pipelining works, how to take advantage of delay slots, and being able to compare the differences of RISC and CISC. It's super simple to evolve once the basics are there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957823</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses techniques for simulating water flow over various terrains in computer graphics, focusing on the challenges and methods involved in creating realistic water simulations. It covers the implementation of fluid dynamics concepts, including the use of height maps for terrain representation and numerical methods for simulating the movement of water. The author explores different algorithms, such as the shallow water equations, to achieve visually appealing results, while also emphasizing the importance of performance optimization in real-time applications. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for developers interested in enhancing their projects with realistic water effects.&lt;/p&gt;

Then you can parallelize and simulate an entire water shed at once.It’s such an interesting problem, but it’s also way out of my knowledge domain so I’m mostly just an observer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42962508</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The site provides a comprehensive guide for creating a constructed language (conlang) and offers various resources, tips, and tools to aid in the process. It outlines key components such as phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary, emphasizes the importance of cultural context in language development, and includes examples to inspire and guide aspiring language creators. Additionally, it discusses different conlanging styles and approaches, encouraging creativity and individuality in language design.&lt;/p&gt;

He calls it yingzi (“English writing” in Chinese) but it's designed entirely for English. The point of the page is not to create a new writing system (it doesn't go nearly that far) but simply to give an impression of what Chinese writing is actually like and what effect it has had on its speakers’ perception of their own language. Give it a read, it's super fascinating.https://zompist.com/yingzi/yingzi.htm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This document was hugely influential to me. It got me interested in linguistics (one of the "immaterial sciences" alongside math, comp sci). My username includes "kisone" which is from the conlang I made as a kid. It is wonderful to see it again and I hope folks still enjoy it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zompist is a bit unusual these days: one guy working on one project (his Constructed World Almea) for over 40 years now, with 30 of those on the web. It's a beautiful relic of the early web. Most of the sites from my old "conlang" bookmark folder are dead now, but not zompist.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42917522</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a fascinating read, but the thing that bugs me about this whole affair is that when this came to light many years ago it was treated as a cheating and recruitment scandal. But only recently has it been reframed as a DEI issue.Taking old, resolved scandals - slapping a coat of culture war paint on it - and then selling it as a new scandal is already a popular MO for state-sponsored propoganda, so we should be extra wary of stories like this being massaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working effectively in ATC without burnout hanging over your head constantly favours a certain amount of neurodivergence.  A certain kind of delight in detail, delight in predictable progression of system. The overload needs to invigorate , not fatigue.This doesn’t make ATC professionals better people. It doesn’t make them smarter. It doesn’t make them superhuman. It makes them better at a certain specific kind of work, and the same traits probably make them worse at many others.We need to stop treating neurodiversity as if it’s a scale from good to bad. It’s just a kind of diversity.Just like physical diversity. Strong, big frames make a person better suited to certain kinds of work. Lithe, diminutive builds make great aircraft mechanics. Thin, tall builds favour other work, short and stocky morphology makes other jobs more comfortable and easier.Why should neurodiversity be any different? People are good at different things. Genetics plays a huge role in morphological and neurological development. is there really any difference, or is neurodiversity just hidden morphological diversity?Different is not a value judgement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The story is really worth a read. The writing speaks for itself:&gt; The biographical questionnaire Snow referred to as the “first phase” was an unsupervised questionnaire candidates were expected to take at home. You can take a replica copy here. Questions were chosen and weighted bizarrely, with candidates able to answer “A” to all but one question to get through. Some of the most heavily weighted questions were “The high school subject in which I received my lowest grades was:” (correct answer: science, worth 15 points) and “The college subject in which I received my lowest grades was:” (correct answer: history, for another 15 points).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42944203</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bit of inaccuracy in the article:&gt; a typical Li-ion battery retains only 80 percent of its charge capacity after 300 to 500 cyclesThat's off by 10x at least. Typical LFP batteries that are widely used now have thousands of cycles. Over 5K in some cases. Some of the solid state batteries that are coming to production in the next few years might do better. 300 to 500 is more typical of some older chemistries. Even NMC batteries used in e.g. Teslas have cycle life spans of at least 1500 or so cycles.And for reference, if you charge and full de-charge your car that would be 1 cycle. A decade is only 3653 or so cycles (there might be 2 or 3 leap years). Most car vehicle owners don't charge nearly as often or so completely. A typical Tesla that is partially charged maybe once a week or so is not going to need a battery replacement until the 2040s or so.Anyway, the article carefully avoids talking about energy density. Which is of course the key thing here. Together with other things like charging speeds. Operational temperatures, etc. These all matter.This is a university study, not a plan to get this to production. Promising and interesting but probably well over a decade away from any serious applications. By that time we might have all sorts of other battery tech that is sitting a bit higher on the technological readiness scale on the market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The link to the paper is hidden a few links into the article  (what's up with all these 'tags' that they link to?):"A Recyclable Inert Inorganic Framework Assisted Solid-State Electrolyte for Long-Life Aluminum Ion Batteries", https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.4c01615 (Open Access)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want a battery that will last a really long time, nickel-iron batteries already do that. They have 50+ year life spans and are incredibly robust. And if you care about recycling, well its just nickel and iron. The nickel you obviously would want back, but the iron is worth almost nothing.Until we can surpass current lithium batteries in energy density, cycle stability, and safety all at once, iron-nickel is more than good enough to be used in any application where current lithium tech struggles, and will outlive you along with being infinitely recyclable and basically as safe as any battery ever could be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960907</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a gentle warning: try out alternative Discord clients with a non-important account first.
A few years ago, I used ripcord¹ and got automatically banned by Discord - probably because I had started the original Discord client on the same computer, and this triggered some heuristics.
Discord's first-level support was not willing to reinstate my account, and I had to² track down their head of security on Twitter to get my account reinstated.¹) https://cancel.fm/ripcord/, no new releases since 2021²) I'd not generally suggest this approach. However, since COVID we have been using Discord a lot for informal communication with our students. Losing access to a dozen course servers mid-semester was a huge problem for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It surprises me that they copied the suboptimal tablet-like UI layout of the official client. It's gotta be an MDI app with each chat in a separate window :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still don't get why so many channels that should probably be on IRC moved to Discord. Yesterday I tried to share the output of an strace and apparently I have to pay to emit more than 2000 characters. Login to Discord is something that shocks me: every single time I'm told that I'm logging in from a new computer (wrong). Confim I'm human. Then need to check my email. Confirm. And relogin. This at least to me happens every single time. Reported to Discord obviously in vain. Never experienced such a login disaster in my life.What is wrong with IRC and mailing lists that everyone jumped to Discord? Since I have started to use Discord couldn't find a single good thing about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42917268</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenWRT is pretty great at offering features and security for consumer devices. Glad to see a release!I used it for a while, but after I've had it for a few months, and want to improve/diagnose something, I can't easily tell which config I've changed from defaults, and so can't easily diagnose how I might have screwed it up, or predict how changes will impact the rest of the system.I moved my router to NixOS, where I can now see the ~250 config that covers the custom setup needed for my ISP/LAN.If asked, I'd still recommend OpenWRT for most techies, since it's easier to get started.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenWrt is great. I recently got 10 Gbit internet at home and had to replace my Ubiquiti USG3, and running OpenWrt on a Lenovo Tiny PC is easy and efficient.OpenWrt 24 adds support for configuring the ISP's IPIP6 tunnel I need to access IPv4 on my IPv6-native connection - for now I've been manually installing the newer package straight out of the 24 RCs into my OpenWrt 23 install but now I guess I can upgrade the whole install!I also tried pfSense/opnSense but it seems like the FreeBSD kernel struggles with 10 Gbit network connections without picking very specific hardware, but Linux works perfectly (had a similar experience with TrueNAS CORE vs SCALE)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always wanted to try OpenWRT but was put off by the necessity of doing hardware modifications to stock routers to gain root access. So naturally, once I found out that they were releasing some official hardware for OpenWRT (the OpenWRT One router), I ordered it as soon as possible. The router is excellent! It solved my bufferbloat issues and much more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42958202</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a novel framework for enhancing the security and privacy of federated learning systems. It introduces a solution that addresses challenges related to data leakage and model inversion attacks, ensuring that participants can contribute to the learning process without compromising sensitive information. The authors propose a combination of differential privacy and secure multi-party computation techniques to protect individual data contributions while still enabling effective model training. The research highlights the importance of balancing data utility with privacy concerns in distributed learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/modula...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something like this seems expected, right? If you tune a statistical model to very high accuracy in "addition" over tokens, then the resulting structure of the model must correspond to some structure in the training data. And fourier would make sense for some token like "123" which internally is represented as the integer 7633, but needs to "contain" information about the text digits for math to work. Notably, this still ends up being in some way a statistical endeavor rather than truly learning addition, as even the fine-tuned model doesn't reach 100% accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is .. pretty interesting! According to the abstract, models trained long enough use some feature layers for magnitude assessment, and others for modular assessment, (e.g. even / odd). It's surprising to me that this is a stable outcome for trained LLMs when they encounter math. Definitely not what seems simplest to my meatspace brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960989</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a report revealing that the U.S. government disclosed 39 zero-day vulnerabilities in 2023, marking the first time such data has been systematically reported. These vulnerabilities, which are security flaws that are exploited before a patch is available, were highlighted as a significant concern for national security and cybersecurity. The report emphasizes the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities to safeguard critical infrastructure and protect against potential threats. It also notes the implications for software developers and organizations in maintaining secure systems to prevent exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

There are so many better ways and algorithms to do it, but I learned a lot of cool tech anyway with this approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are some contemporary links for those looking to learn more about reinforcement learning:- Reinforcement Learning Discussion on Discord, https://discord.com/invite/5nDB9dzZvp- /r/reinforcementlearning, https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/- CS285, Deep Reinforcement Learning course at Berkeley, https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/And this was probably posted here before, but it's fun nonetheless: Gran Turismo played by an RL agent, https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/Edit: and there's this "blog" that gives some very practical advice for beginners: https://www.decisionsanddragons.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare also GAN Theft Auto: https://github.com/Sentdex/GANTheftAuto&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42958012</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper came up as a pre-print. You can't make the extrapolation that the headline is making - they're using gas chromatography to estimate quantities from 1-2mg samples, and then extrapolating to get to these scary sounding whole-organ estimates. If you look at the paper [1], you'll see that the microplastics in in situ samples are not discernible by light microscopy, and that there was a ~25% variation in within sample measurement of the GC [2], indicating a great deal of uncertainty in the precision of the fundamental measurement (the authors brush this off; see quote below).Basically, you've got an extremely sensitive measurement system being used to make tiny measurements, and then they extrapolate these measurements by a huge factor to get to ug/g estimates. Further extrapolating (to the weight of an organ, say) when you know that there's 25% inter-sample variation, is just guaranteed to be nonsense.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1[2] "Both analytical laboratories (UNM and OSU) observed a ~25% within-sample coefficient of variation, which does not alter the conclusions regarding temporal trends or accumulation in brains relative to other tissues, given the magnitude of those effects."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember that car tire degredation is a significant portion of microplastics in the environment. Investing in mass transit is as imperative as it was to move away from leaded gasoline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perfect, I was hoping to increase my neuroplasticity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957726</guid></item><item><title>21.

Later, I would use it for Advent of Code, tinkered with a Scala Play webapp, and dream about using it professionally. Rust has almost completely filled that void now. Rust is native, I'm not waiting on the 1.0 release of `scala-native` anymore. The community around Rust seems to be enthusiastic and growing, as opposed to languishing for Scala. I hold some reservations about Rust in terms of how complicated it is. Despite having used it for an amount of time that I would be feeling comfortable in most languages, I am still not comfortable and continually encounter _stuff I don't understand_.RIP Scala, I will miss you! You showed me the joy of pattern matching, functional OO, currying, how to use `map` `flatMap` `fold`, etc. All things with continued influence! &lt;3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I left the Scala ecosystems (mostly) a year or 4 ago, right around the release of Scala 3. It's a shame that the compatibility and tooling situation doesn't seem to have improved much since then. The Scala devs always said they wanted to avoid a Python 2-&gt;3 situation, but it seemed like they didn't quite achieve that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good report.Scala 3 is really what Scala was supposed to be. The language is just about perfect, and the most important and popular libraries and tools (Cats/Cats Effect, ZIO, Play Framework, Akka/Apache Pekko) are all supporting the new version for years already.It's really a shame that IDE support has yet to catch up and the dev experience is frustrating at times, but I'm using Scala 3 for everything I can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42964773</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really cool result, and I'm looking forward to reading Part 3.My view on the ROM is that cryptographic proofs (the ones we are able to actually do) always rule out only some attacks but not out others.  A standard model (non-ROM) proof will still be under some assumption about lattices or elliptic curves or AES or whatever, will be valid only under a certain model of the attacker's capabilities and goals, and will often have tightness issues (where the parameters or probability of success on the "proved" system will be worse than with the assumption).  Even a tight unconditional proof (such as for the one-time pad) assumes a certain model of the attacker's goals and capabilities.The ROM is another axis of this: a ROM proof rules out attacks that treat the hash function as a random oracle.  Since hash functions are designed to have as few non-ROM properties as possible, and since most real attacks on cryptosystems either break the hash or treat it as a random oracle, ruling out those attacks can usually give you some confidence.  But if your cryptosystem is itself making use of non-ROM properties of the hash, then it gives you a lot less confidence, and that's the situation of this new KRS result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and for those who already saw this first post, part 2 was published today: https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/06/how-to-p...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42939312</guid></item><item><title>29.

    ...baz...
  } }

Means 'when you receive the token 'foo' from channel, read another value from it, call it bar, then do the stuff inside the braces'.  The `foo` and the `=&gt;` are tightly linked; `[bar]` is in-between lexically but logically the order is:  channel { foo =&gt; {
    channel [bar]
    ...baz...
  } }

i.e. it doesn't make sense to think about the `[bar]` part until after the `=&gt;` has done its job of matching 'foo'.In the same vein, putting "!" and "?" directly after some other token makes it look those go together, but they are separate things.  caller.empty!

Sends 'empty' to caller, then closes caller.  Maybe just writing this with spaces between the parts makes it more clear:  caller .empty !

Parentheses and square brackets are more about what's inside them than what's outside; `.foo` means 'send literal symbol 'foo'', `(foo)` means 'send value named foo', and `[foo]` means 'accept value and call it foo'.  All represent operations to be performed on 'the channel in question', but by shoving things together it 'looks like' a method call or something to someone used to looking at C-like languages.I am mentally putting spaces like that in there as I read through the README.  channel .foo (true) [bar]

and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42910667</guid></item><item><title>31.

From the distance and to me with my poor eyesight and my prescription that wasn't up to date, it looked like a gray ring left on the paper with a giant leaking coffee mug.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Frank Lloyd Wright's visionary design for a mile-high skyscraper, which he proposed in the early 1950s. This ambitious project was intended to stand as the tallest building in the world, featuring a unique form that integrated nature with urban living. The design aimed to address various modern challenges, including urban sprawl and housing shortages, by creating a vertical city that housed offices, homes, and public spaces. Despite its innovative concepts and artistic ambition, the project ultimately remained a theoretical endeavor, showcasing Wright's forward-thinking approach to architecture and urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;

If not active, parks become ill-maintained, desolate, and foreboding. In the worst case scenario, they become havens for crime, since there are no witnesses or bystanders to help out someone getting mugged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thats's from Wright's big pointy object period. Several of his unbuilt designs, including Broadacre City and the Arizona state capital, included big pointy objects. The Marin Civic Center was the only completed project where the big pointy object [1] was built.[1] https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/26/a4/cb/8f/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, looks like the burj khalifa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42967226</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the absence of a unified cross-platform API for timer functionalities in operating systems, highlighting the challenges faced by developers when building applications that require timing operations. It emphasizes the differences in timer implementations across various platforms, which can lead to inconsistencies and increased complexity in code. The author advocates for a standardized approach to timer APIs that would streamline development and improve the reliability of timing operations across different systems, ultimately enhancing the developer experience and application performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article fails to separate the concerns one has with timers. There's three cases I see:The simple case is just putting a thread to sleep for a given time. It's somewhat odd that there's no portable API for that, granted. At least POSIX has sleep, nanosleep and clock_nanosleep (list edited, thanks oguz-ismail).The second case is that a thread wants to continue processing until a timer has passed. This has to happen cooperatively one way or another, so setting a timer is equivalent to regularly querying the system time and comparing to a limit. There is simply no need for a "timer" operating system facility. (Even if you were to plug POSIX timers in here, you'd in all likelihood still need to check some flag set in the signal handler in the processing thread. And then you'd still need to check the system time as signals can originate from anywhere, just as with sleep/etc. above.)In the third case, a thread waits for I/O. Then, of course, the call to that I/O facility defines how any timer is handled. As these facilities are not portable, timers aren't portable. The author refers to this realization as the need to implement "Userspace timers". These are just an artifact of the I/O facility and calls querying the system time, though.So, ultimately, not having portable timers is the least of our problems. So long as we don't unify select, poll, kqueue, io_uring and what not, we don't have a need for them. And, as the author realized, libraries like libuv, which do an acceptable job at unifying those facilities, tend to provide a portable timer API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Windows, you can use CreateWaitableTimer to create a timer that doesn't need a window: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi...Wait for it to time out using one of the WaitFor family of functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very minor point: Windows applications only come with a message queue if you explicitly start one, so if you have a headless application it needs to have an invisible "window". However I agree with the author that it is a pretty nice API in general. There are some problems caused by the very limited parameter size, but it's a standard notification API for asynchronous OS events. We use it headlessly for detecting USB insertions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42915437</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I bought a couple of old Zeiss Ikon folding cameras from ebay, a 6x6 and a 6x9. They are from the 1950s and so have coated lenses, but are otherwise quite similar to the 1930s models. Both cameras are still in perfect working condition, accurate shutter speeds.It's such a pleasure to use them: compact form factor, requires deliberation, they smell good too :)The aesthetic quality of the images they produce is well worth the effort - pretty sharp when you need it but soft around the edges when aperture is wide open which can look lovely, nice color rendition, amazing bokeh.I take a lot of digital photos but for me using vintage cameras is so much more rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite amazingly - I never realised how good photo quality was in the 1930s (and presumably earlier too). Look at these examples which were immediately digitised (one of a WWII reenactment scene which enhances the effect) - they don't look anything like how we expect a 1930s-era photo to appear.https://licm.org.uk/livingImage/Leica_II-Results.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My grandfather, born in 1908, was a professional photographer, so I'm certain he used some of these models. My regret is not knowing him when he was younger, as my only memories are from when I was a young child. I learned he was a writer, amateur electrician/tinkerer, etc.One of the funnest things I've bought on eBay was a photograph of a circus elephant that he did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960382</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up audio on FreeBSD, focusing on achieving bit-perfect playback and utilizing an equalizer in real-time. It covers the necessary software installations, configuration steps, and best practices to enhance audio quality. The guide is aimed at users looking to optimize their audio experience on FreeBSD systems, providing both detailed instructions and tips for troubleshooting common issues.&lt;/p&gt;

Linux users will also find useful information, especially in the context of configuring and personalising the MPD player and filters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is missing a good justification for digging into realtime processing. For me that was to create a DIY receiver, so the equaliser/room correction needs to happen quickly and consistently to maintain lip sync. I'm not sure it's quite so justified for an audio/music serverFreeBSD never crossed my radar as a viable platform for realtime audio processing, instead I had good luck with Linux + RT patch + Pulseaudio + https://github.com/bmc0/dsp. (Pulseaudio really shines in this kind of use case, will resample to correct for slight differences in input/output clocks etc)Also an aside, "USB cable: WireWorld ULTRAVIOLET 8" is a controversial thing to mention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious about why pipewire is unfortunate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42915610</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;ArxivTok is a web application designed to simplify and enhance the process of exploring research papers on arXiv. It utilizes a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for research papers, filter results by various categories, and view detailed information about each paper, including abstracts, authors, and publication dates. The platform aims to facilitate users in keeping up with the latest developments in artificial intelligence and related fields, making academic research more accessible and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great idea!  The scrolling is a bit broken though.  I can't scroll down the text on my trackpad without it going to the next article, and also it just a lot of articles with a tiny movement of the trackpad.Otherwise it's a really fun idea!  Can I suggest you also scrape from https://www.medrxiv.org/?  This is where a lot of medical research preprints, not arxiv&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks great. But it's missing one critical feature of "fast-food" apps like TikTok: the content is not easily digestible. Which is understandable, because scientific papers are dense.Maybe a good idea would be to parse the abstract through an LLM to make it more understandable (maybe caching the results so it's not expensive)? Maybe also using some standard style, like starting with a couple of "dumbed-down" sentences of the article for the non-expert, and progressively explaining better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny to think this is actually kind of similar to how ByteDance got their start. One of their first apps is called "Today's headlines", which is basically the TikTok format, but instead of short videos you are scrolling news article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42947875</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the mystery of how life can arise in environments with minimal sunlight, such as deep-sea ecosystems and caves, where photosynthesis is not viable. It discusses alternative energy sources that sustain life, including chemosynthesis, where organisms derive energy from chemical reactions, and the roles of extremophiles that thrive in such dark conditions. The piece also examines the implications of these findings for understanding life's resilience and the potential for existence in similar environments beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the availability of free MP3 music download services through the Listen-MP3 platform. It highlights the convenience and user-friendly nature of the website, which allows users to easily search for and download their favorite songs without any cost. Additionally, it emphasizes the benefits of accessing a wide range of music genres and the legal implications of using such services. The piece encourages readers to explore the platform while being mindful of copyright issues associated with music downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know why this article says "now". It was over 7, almost 8 years ago that the final patents on MP3 expired. There was even HN discussion at the time:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14240645More notable is that many H.264 patents are expiring this year:https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Have_the_patents_for_H.264_M...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason why no one noticed is that everyone has been trivially circumnavigating the patents for decades (the usual model being a converter that doesn't come with its own lame.dll but asks you to put one into its folder) and Frauenhofer hasn't been caring much when it was private users as opposed to hardware manufacturers. If not for this, something like Ogg Vorbis would have taken its place.As to files, I'm sure they start mattering to you when your train goes through a tunnel or your wifi is down. The fileless world is the leakiest abstraction of them all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still rip every audio CD (including audiobooks) into MP3 and I have about 8 GB of MP3 audio files in my library (a lot of children's audio books in there for the kids).The format plays on nearly every device that plays any kind of music ever made, files are tiny, and they sound amazing still.It's so much different than like 480i videos from old VHS and DV tape imports from the MP3 era.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957517</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a quick guide to AsciiDoc, a text-based document format optimized for writing in plain text while enabling rich formatting. It explains the basics of AsciiDoc syntax, including how to create headers, lists, links, and images, as well as how to customize documents with attributes. Additionally, the guide discusses the conversion of AsciiDoc files into various formats like HTML, PDF, and EPUB, making it a useful resource for writers, developers, and anyone interested in structured documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As much as people don't really like it, reStructuredText with Sphinx is still my favorite one of these. Once you get into wanting to do fancy things, the sheer power and extensibility of it with custom directives and community plugins is hard to beat. The glossary, index, and project cross-referencing features (intersphinx) are amazing. You can easily integrate with Bibtex reference libraries (maybe managed in Zotero). You can do full-on traceable QA in it, not just for software, but for hardware projects as well using e.g. sphinx-needs [1]. I think for some sophisticated applications, reST + sphinx is best.And of course you can write some pages in this ecosystem in Markdown if you want using MyST [2][1] https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[2] https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve used AsciiDoc for some of our documentation and for generating slide decks.It is obviously a nice system but over time our frustration with it grew. Every other piece of software we have uses Markdown: GitHub, work chat, chats of open source projects we work with, things like StackOverflow, HackMD, personal note taking apps, the list goes on and on. Every new person joining our team had to adjust to AsciiDoc just for some of the work they would be doing while staying with Markdown for everything else.We pulled the plug last year and migrated everything we had to Markdown, and while sometimes I need to use HTML tags to do something advanced I don’t mind it as much as I thought I would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not sure I think they are that comparable. AschiiDoc is a proper mark-up language, something markdown explicitly sets out not to be. Markdown is easy to remember, easy to consume in its clear-text form and renderable. I fail to see that AsciiDoc or HTML having "unrendered consumption" as a goal at all.There is so much you can't put in Markdown because it doesn't work without rendering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960241</guid></item><item><title>42.

Good ones that instantly read used to cost like $75, and the cheap kind would take literal minutes to arrive at the real temp, but I think someone in China figured out the secret and brought the price down to like $14. Mine has a magnet and I keep it right next to the microwave and air fryer. It has made it tremendously easier to get food correctly heated through, in both devices.The other thing I believe in strongly is, for most things, using 40-60% power and heating the food about twice as long as your original instincts say, for more even heating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're screwing around with microwave sources, I'll pass on a warning I got from one of my profs.Microwaves will heat your body up, but in a relatively harmless way.  e.g. If you microwave your hands a bit, blood flow will transfer that heat out and things will remain pretty okay unless you really overdo it.Your eyes are an exception.  They're orbs of aqueous humor that's mostly water, but have relatively little blood flow when compared to most other tissues in the body.  Microwaves will heat them up, but bloodflow won't distribute the heat away quickly.  Protect your eyes around microwave sources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone has a school-age child needing a science experiment, my niece created a list of various items and what she expected their behavior to be in a microwave at different cooking times.And then tested her hypothesis in a cheap microwave (out in the yard in case of explosions), documenting what happened with photos and making a conclusion for each. She got top scores from the teacher for following the scientific method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42961606</guid></item><item><title>43. Reasons Not to Refactor</title><link>https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reasons-not-to-refactor</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses several reasons why refactoring code may not be the best course of action in certain situations. It highlights that refactoring can introduce new bugs, consume significant time, or divert focus from other critical tasks, especially if the current codebase is functioning adequately. The piece encourages developers to weigh the benefits against the potential costs and consider alternative solutions, such as adding tests or addressing specific issues without a complete refactor. Ultimately, it advises a more strategic approach to maintaining and improving code rather than an automatic inclination to refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42928186"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent about a 12 year period of my career doing triage and app performance work. What struck me was how often the core problems were architectural. Either the design was bad from the beginning, or the requirements had changed so dramatically over time (think scaling, for example) that the architecture no longer worked. I bring this up because while I saw a lot of questionable code, at the micro level it really didn't matter. Sure it could have been refactored and improved, but that would have been essentially diminishing returns. Often the improvements that were needed would have been so painful that rather than make them, I watched companies spiral around either throwing hardware at problems or replacing the application entirely because that kind of Bandaid rip was deemed "easier" in the overall politics of the corporate world. So point being - sure, refactor what you can, but don't get too hung up on things that ultimately won't matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple and brief rules are more successful in practice than long and complicated rules.I feel a briefer and more-to-the-point "When To Refactor" guide is to ask the following questions in the following order and only proceed when you can answer YES to every single question.1. Do we have test coverage of the use-cases that are affected?2. Are any non-trivial logic and business changes on the horizon for the code in question?3. Has the code in question been undergoing multiple modifications in the last two/three/four weeks/months/years?Honestly, if you answer NO to any of the questions above, you're in for a world of hurt and expense if you then proceed to refactor.That last one might seem a bit of a reach, but the reality is that if there is some code in production that has been working unchanged for the last two years, you're wasting your time refactoring it.More importantly, no changes over the last few years means that absolutely no one in the company has in-depth and current knowledge of how that code works, so a refactor is pointless because no one knows what the specific problems actually are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If we’re embarking on a change that is not really refactoring (for example looking at a bug or an adjustment after a third party change), we can’t fix it with refactoring.Funnily enough I did once fix a bug through refactoring. IIRC it was some intermittent race condition in some async code that I just couldn’t figure out, so I rewrote the code to do the same thing but simpler and the problem disappeared. I was too tired and relieved to continue figuring it out why it was originally broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42928186</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the release of Go 1.24, which includes updates for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliance. It highlights enhancements in cryptographic libraries to ensure compatibility with government regulations, emphasizes security improvements, and outlines how developers can enable FIPS mode in their applications. Additionally, the article provides guidance on understanding FIPS requirements and the implications of using Go in FIPS-compliant systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The upstream Go 1.24 changes and macOS support using system libraries in Microsoft's Go distribution are really significant for the large ecosystem of startups trying to sell to institutions requiring FIPS 140 certified cryptography.For a variety of reasons - including "CGo is not Go" (https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go) - using boringcrypto and requiring CGO_ENABLED=1 could be a blocker. Not using system libraries meant that getting all of the software to agree on internal certificate chains was a chore. Go was in a pretty weird place.Whether FIPS 140 is actually a good target for cryptography is another question. My understanding is that FIPS 140-1 and 140-2 cipher suites were considered by many experts to be outdated when those standards were approved, and that FIPS 140 still doesn't encompass post quantum crypto, and the algorithms chosen don't help mitigate misuse (e.g.: nonce reuse).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL there are multiple flavors of Golang including “Microsoft Go”. Wow - I’ve been away from Golang too long. I was initially shocked and then kind of sad that Go is not so simple anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IIRC, the FIPS-compliant Go crypto project was a Filippo Valsorda joint. I hate it, but I'm glad someone sane managed it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42965404</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the launch of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant designed to enhance developers' productivity by suggesting code snippets and functions while they write. It highlights the benefits of using Copilot, such as accelerating the coding process, improving code quality, and enabling developers to focus on higher-level problem solving. The post also includes insights into how Copilot learns from a vast range of public code and shares its integration with popular development environments to streamline workflows. Overall, it emphasizes Copilot's role in transforming software development through innovative AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When we introduced GitHub Copilot back in 2021, we had a clear goal: to make developers’ lives easier with an AI pair programmer that helps them write better code. The name reflects our belief that artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t replacing the developer.Later:&gt; GitHub Copilot’s new agent mode is capable of iterating on its own code, recognizing errors, and fixing them automatically.Is this Microsoft/GitHub acknowledging they initially missed the mark, except they aren't really clear in the post that they're abandoning the approach of "AI pair programmer / not replacing the developer"? Seems really strange to re-iterate their "clear goal" and then in the next paragraph go directly against their goal? Are they maybe afraid of a potential backslash if it became more clear that they're now looking to replace (some) developers / the boring parts of development?I have no opinions either way, but the messaging of the post seems to go into all different directions, which seems strange.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They'd better get on the IntelliJ integration fast— 
if I'm going to switch editors in order to use an LLM coding assistant, I may as well just switch to Cursor, which has a strong head start on them on the assistant and also has a much better autocomplete.I'm honestly surprised to see no mention here of them moving to replicate Cursor's autocomplete—IMO that is where Cursor's real edge lies. Anyone can wrap a chatbot in some UI that allows you to avoid pasting by hand, but Cursor's ability to guess my next move—even several lines away—makes it far and away more efficient than alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Copilot puts the human at the center of the creative work that is software development. AI helps with the things you don’t want to do, so you have more time for the things you do.”… until we train our model on your usage data and totally replace you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42964327</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "status circles," which are social groups in which individuals seek approval and recognition based on shared values or achievements. The author explores how these circles influence behavior, define social hierarchies, and affect personal identity. Additionally, it reflects on the importance of being aware of one's own status circle and how it can impact relationships and perceptions. The piece encourages readers to critically examine their motivations for social interaction and the pursuit of status within their circles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This blog post seems to be slightly on the rambling end of the spectrum, which leads me to suggest that he would get a lot of value out of doing some more research; such as a pleasant browse through Wikipedia. There are surely well-recognised terms for the things he is describing and there'll be a lot of literature available if he uses them. For example, it looks to me like there is overlap between this article and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_states_theory or the concept of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_group so I'd expect the terms to come up. That wouldn't necessarily change the article but it'd give him a more robust mental framework to analyse these topics.Also, the lead paragraph seems a bit incongruous. I mean, sure throwing in a random political jab will get people's attention but it lacks follow up analysis. Care is one of the least useful forces out there for making the world better. We've got so much more value out of harnessing greed and activating selfishness that it might be all we need to run a prosperous society. And hence the greedy are much more important to my wellbeing then nebulous people who care about me from a great distance. Most of my material wealth came from people who not only didn't care but also didn't care about me or even know I even existed. It was acquired on a strictly transactional basis to the benefit of everyone involved. That aligns the incentives to make wealth generation sustainable and available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Social dynamics from first principles" posts always grind my gears. It's a timid, egotistical landgrab, planting a flag on well-trodden ground.The OG sociologists navigated with more humility. They accepted the role of observer + tourist. I liked Stigma by Erving Goffman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is the thesis:&gt; By telling the world directly what your community respects, you might induce them to change what they respect, or to join your community.I think we're all pretty clear what different communities value, by the way those communities communicate, the way they act, and who they vote for as representatives. That's how you directly communicate what your community respects, the sum total of your words and actions, and actions count extra.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42947081</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decline in crime rates within the New York City subway system alongside an increase in ridership as the city approaches 2025. It highlights recent statistics showing a significant drop in criminal incidents, which contributes to commuters feeling safer while using public transit. The piece also emphasizes ongoing efforts by transit authorities and law enforcement to maintain safety and encourage more riders to return to the subway. Overall, it presents a positive outlook on subway travel in NYC as crime decreases and ridership rises.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;147 reported crimes in a month in NYC's very busy subway. That's it.Don't let social media fool you. The US is not becoming a crime ridden cesspool, the only stinking I smell is from scaremongers that profit from your fear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does 'throwaway519' live in NYC?
Doubtful.What 'throwaway519' doesn't know, because they don't work in an NYPD precinct, is that most subway crime is not reported, and if it is reported, it is downgraded, or outright dismissed. When a crime is committed and the suspect gets a DAT, once they have completed 6 months without another offense, the crime is deleted from the reported crime numbers. How do I know this? 14 years on the job in Manhattan--and I've never seen it this bad. We get 150 complaints a day at my precinct for Subway crime. 147 crimes... What. a. joke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to admit that while I never believed the hysteria of “crime ridden cities” and my wife and I started traveling a lot post Covid - including “crime ridden” [sic] places like Seattle and San Francisco - I have to admit that I always thought the subway system in NYC would be some dystopian nightmare.When I went there in 2023 during the US Open, we rode the subway everywhere and I didn’t feel the least bit nervous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42958474</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get excited when I see things like this, even if they're simple because I think I can build a business on top of it. However, in complex tasks and real-life cases, it's successful in very few instances. I can't trust its stability. This makes me feel like I've been deceived. I believe agents will be used for tasks that require very little intelligence and constant repetition. It's actually an assistant in situations like this demo. I want to use agents everywhere, but they're not successful in their outputs. GPT-4 is still being used at large scales. I don't know what the situation is with high-level usage of models that do reasoning like o1 through APIs, I haven't tried it. I tried Deepseek, and I encountered stability issues with Deepseek APIs. Besides, R1 doesn't have function calls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty basic for a sales agent. Most of this flow has been available as sales enablement tech for &gt; 10 years through Salesforce &amp; Hubspot plugins.Even Marketo could automatically place a call to a live warm agent with enriched information within 1 minute of a lead form being filled out on a website in 2010.Operator did blow me away though. That is next level compared to Selenium and Puppeteer. While this sales agent feels very me-too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am quite confident that this is basically a scam which won't work for at least 95% of businesses. Colin Fraser had a very nice demonstration that Deep Research can't keep track of NBA teams: https://xcancel.com/colin_fraser/status/1887020255781752949#...So how exactly is a similar technology supposed to work with the highly specific details of an individual business? If the sales agent only has, say, 90% accuracy at reporting prices or product information, then it's unusable. I would guess it's actually much worse than 90%, even considering improvements in RAG benchmarks.Maybe OpenAI figured it out and I will eat crow. But I suspect this presentation is marketed towards AI investors rather than sales executives. Investors are happy to pay for fun sci-fi stories about the future of AI, whereas salespeople actually need to sell something in the present.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42959923</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Meta has allegedly used over 81.7 terabytes of pirated books to train its AI models, raising significant ethical and legal concerns among authors and copyright advocates. This revelation highlights ongoing debates regarding intellectual property rights in the context of AI development and the implications for creators in the publishing industry. Authors argue that this practice undermines their rights and potential earnings, prompting calls for clearer regulations on the use of copyrighted material for training AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the encyclopedic knowledge LLMs have of written works I assume all parties did the same. But I think there is a broader point to make here. Youtube was initially a ghost town (it started as a dating site) and it only got traction once people started uploading copyrighted TV shows to it. Google itself got big by indexing other people's data without compensation. Spotify's music library was also pirated in the early days. The contracts with the music labels came later. GPL violations by commercial products fits the theme also.Companies aggressively protect their own intellectual property but have no qualms about violating the IP rights of others. Companies. Individuals have no such privilege. If you plug a laptop into a closet at MIT to download some scientific papers you forfeit your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more I learn about how AI companies trained their models, the more obvious it is that the rest of us are just suckers. We're out here assuming that laws matter, that we should never misrepresent or hide what we're doing for our work, that we should honor our own terms of use and the terms of use of other sites/products, that if we register for a website or piece of content we should always use our work email address so that the person or company on the other side of that exchange can make a reasonable decision about whether we can or should have access to it.What we should have been doing all along is YOLO-ing everything. It's only illegal if you get caught. And if you get big enough before you get caught then the rules never have to apply to you anyway.Suckers. All of us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why it's even a question that Meta trained their LLM on copyrighted material. They say so in their paper! Quoting from their LLaMMa paper [Touvron et al., 2023]:&gt; We include two book corpora in our training dataset: the Gutenberg Project, [...], and the Books3 section of ThePile (Gao et al., 2020), a publicly available dataset for training large language models.Following that reference:&gt; Books3 is a dataset of books derived from a copy of the contents of the Bibliotik private tracker made available by Shawn Presser (Presser, 2020).(Presser, 2020) refers to https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1320282149329784833. (Which funnily refers to this DMCA policy: https://the-eye.eu/dmca.mp4)Furthermore, they state they trained on GitHub, web pages, and ArXiv, which are all contain copyrighted content.Surely the question is: is it legal to train and/or use and/or distribute an AI model (or its weights, or its outputs) that is trained using copyrighted material. That it was trained on copyrighted material is certain.[Touvron et al., 2023] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971[Gao et al., 2020] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42971446</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of reasoning in large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities to perform logical deductions and problem-solving tasks. It discusses the architecture of LLMs, their training processes, and the underlying mechanisms that enable them to generate coherent text and reason through information. Additionally, the article examines the limitations of LLMs when it comes to complex reasoning, providing insights into future research directions and improvements needed for enhancing their reasoning abilities. Overall, it emphasizes the importance of understanding how LLMs process and understand language in order to leverage their potential effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I don't like about the trend in reasoning LLMs is the over-optimization to coding problems / math problems in particular.A lot of things that aren't well-defined require reasoning, and not just in a "SWE is ambiguous" kind of way - for example, thinking about how to present/teach something in a good way, iterating with the learner, thinking about what context they could be missing, etc.I find that all of these reasoning models really will overfit and overthink if you attach some level of math problem to it but it will barely think for anything else. I had friends suggest to me (I can't tell if in jest or seriously) that other fields don't require thinking, but I dunno, a lot of these "soft things" I think about really hard and don't have great solutions to.I've always been a fan of self-learning, for example - wouldn't it be great to have a conversation partner who can both infer and understand your misconceptions about complex topics when trying to learn, just from a few sentences, and then guide you for that?It's not like it's fundamentally impossible. These LLMs definitely can solve harder coding problems when you make them think. It's just that, I'm pretty sure (and it's really noticable with deepseek) that they're overfit towards coding/math puzzles in particular.It's really noticable with deepseek when you ask its reasoning model to just write some boilerplate code... you can tell it's completely overfit because it will just overthink and overthink and overthink. But it doesn't do that for example, with "soft" questions. In my opinion, this points to the idea that it's not really deciding for itself "how much thinking is enough thinking" and that it's just really overfit. Which I think can be solved, again, but I think it's more of a training decision issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any work being done in training LLMs on more restricted formal languages? Something like a constraint solver or automated theorem prover, but much lower level. Specifically something that isn't natural language. That's the only path I could see towards reasoning models being truly effectiveI know there is work being done with e.g. Lean integration with ChatGPT, but that's not what I mean exactly -- there's still this shakey natural-language-trained-LLM glue in the driver's seatLike I'm envisioning something that has the creativity to try different things, but then JIT compile their chain of thought, and avoid bad paths&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice explainer. The R1 paper is a relatively easy read. Very approachable, almost conversational.I say this because I am constantly annoyed by poor, opaque writing in other instances. In this case, DS doesn’t need to try to sound smart. The results speak for themselves.I recommend anyone who is interested in the topic to read the R1 paper, their V3 paper, and DeepSeekMath paper. They’re all worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42966720</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has ordered Apple to grant access to iCloud accounts as part of its efforts to enhance national security and law enforcement capabilities. This move requires Apple to comply with a warrant that seeks data related to criminal investigations. The article discusses the implications of this order for user privacy and data security, as well as the potential challenges Apple faces in balancing compliance with protecting user information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anecdote: In 2022, while visiting San Francisco, I had the chance to explore the campus. Wandering through the quiet, empty halls of the summer buildings, I was just about to leave when I unexpectedly came across Knuth's office [1]. I had to do a double take—it was surprisingly small for someone of his stature. Yet, in a way, it felt perfectly fitting, a reflection of his unassuming nature.https://janvandenberg.blog/wp-content/img_1813-scaled.jpgAbout the checks: I have not 1 but 2 checks. Small typos, nothing big: but wonderful to have these two documents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On my off hours, I’ve been working through volumes 4A and 4B. They are really wonderful, I highly recommend them. They’re not practical for the vast majority of programmers, but the way he designs and writes about algorithms is remarkable, truly unique. The Dancing Links implementation in 4B in particular (updated significantly from his famous paper) is like a work of art, it’s such an intricate and gorgeous data structure, and blazing fast as well. Man still got it, in his 80s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was in San Francisco a few years back and I was amazed to learn that Donald Knuth not only still lives, but it still giving these once a year lectures in Stanford. Going there, finding the right building in the university, and then seeing this man speak about things I could only barely follow gave me such a memorable evening. What a legend Donald Knuth is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42970240</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The website includes a discussion from the Linux Kernel Mailing List regarding technical updates and proposals related to the Linux kernel. It features contributions from various developers, addressing topics such as improvements, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. The conversation highlights collaborative efforts within the community to refine kernel performance and maintain stability, along with insights on the challenges faced by developers in implementing these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42972062"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Rust drama is an uncommon failure of leadership for Torvalds. Instead of decisively saying "no, never" or "yes, make it so," he has consistently equivocated on the Rust issue. Given the crisis of confidence among a sizeable (and very vocal) contingent of the Linux community, that decision has backfired horribly. And it's quite out of character for Linus not to have a blazingly clear opinion. (We all know his stance on C++, for instance.)As a pilot program, R4L should have graduated or ended a long time ago. After several years of active development, its status remains unclear. Instead of cracking heads to get everyone on the same page, Linus has instead spent all this time sitting back and watching his subordinates fight amongst themselves, only to then place responsibility for the drama on Martin's shoulders. Poor form.Arguably his reprimand of Martin is a clear signal that he will never show Rust any favor, but he hasn't said anything explicitly. Maybe he knows he should, but he fears the shitstorm it will cause. Maybe it's time for him to rip off the band-aid, though.And again, all of this could have been avoided if he'd just put his foot down one way or the other. Imagine how much time and energy (even just Martin's alone) could have been saved if Linus had just said "no, keep it downstream".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been saying this for years now: the rust4linux folks are putting so much effort into trying to upstream their work, seems like they should instead put that effort into maintaining a fork. Arguably it would be less hours spent porting than arguing with humans. Certainly more pleasant!Then one of two things will happen:* Rust will prove its worth and their fork will be the better operating system. Distros will start switching to it one by one due to its increased performance and stability, and they will have dethroned Linus and become gods of the new world.* The project will die because the C programmers will outcompete it with good ol' C, and all their talk about safety doesn't pan out in the real world.If I were the rust4linux leadership, I'd roll those dice.Sounds like Hector Martin is doing exactly that, burning the bridge along the way. Good luck! I think it's the right move (minus the bridge burning).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The frustration seems justified.Spending significant time adapting core kernel code or developing a safe Rust abstraction for DMA, only to be summarily shut down by a single gatekeeper who cites "not wanting multiple languages" is demotivating. It's especially incongruent given that others have championed Rust in the kernel, and Linux has begun hosting Rust modules.If the project leadership — i.e. Linus — truly wants Rust integrated, that stance needs to be firmly established as policy rather than left up to maintainers who can veto work they personally dislike. Otherwise, contributors end up in a limbo where they invest weeks or months, navigate the intricacies of the kernel's development model, and then find out a single personality is enough to block them. Even if that personality has valid technical reasons, the lack of a centralized, consistent direction on Rust's role causes friction.Hector's decision to leave is understandable: either you have an official green light to push Rust forward or you don't. Half measures invite exactly this kind of conflict. And expecting one massive rewrite or an all‐encompassing patch is unrealistic. Integration into something as large and historically C‐centric as Linux must be iterative and carefully built out. If one top‐level developer says "no Rust", while others push "Rust for safety", that is a sign that the project's governance lacks clarity on this point.Hector's departure highlights how messy these half signals can get, and if I were him, I'd also want to see an unambiguous stance on Rust — otherwise, it's not worth investing the time just to beg that your code, no matter how well engineered, might be turned down by personal preference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42972062</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a framework called Three-Nanite, designed to enhance 3D graphics rendering in web applications using Three.js. It integrates Nanite technology from Unreal Engine, enabling efficient rendering of high-detail models by dynamically loading only relevant portions, thereby optimizing performance while maintaining visual fidelity. The project includes examples and documentation to assist developers in implementing this advanced rendering technique in their own 3D applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be really fun to see a Nanite demo where the Reference PoV and and Viewer PoV were independent.That way I could see exactly which meshes are being rendered (w.r.t to the reference), and then rotate around the scene (as a viewer) to get a better idea of where mesh cutting/optimizing is happening.Right now, all I see from these demos are highly performant scenes with rabbits in them. I want to peek behind the veil and see how deep the rabbithole actually goes!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self promotion: I've been working on a WebGPU version of Nanite for over a year now. If you found the OP's work interesting, you might enjoy my very long blog posts on the topic.https://jms55.github.io/posts/2024-06-09-virtual-geometry-be...https://jms55.github.io/posts/2024-11-14-virtual-geometry-be...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related, but Unreal Engine 5 runs in a browser now using WebGPU, courtesy of a startup.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of zip codes in spatial analysis and how they can be leveraged for various applications such as understanding demographic trends, urban planning, and market research. It highlights methodologies for utilizing zip code data effectively, including the advantages of visualizing insights through mapping tools. The post emphasizes the importance of accurate geospatial data in making informed decisions and the potential for businesses and researchers to gain a competitive edge by analyzing zip code-based information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To put it in plain mathematical language, ZIP codes are not defined as polygons [0]. The consequence is that performing any analysis with an assumption that ZIP codes are polygons is bound to be error-prone.0: https://manifold.net/doc/mfd8/zip_codes_are_not_areas.htm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ZIP codes are an emergent property of the mail delivery system. While the author might consider this a bad thing, this makes them "good enough" on multiple axes in practice. They tend to be:- Well-known (everybody knows their zip code)- Easily extracted (they're part of every address, no geocoding required)- Uniform-enough (not perfect, but in most cases close)- Granular-enough- Contiguous-enough by travel timeNotably, the alternatives the author proposes all fail on one or more of these:- Census units: almost nobody knows what census tract they live in, and it can be non-trivial to map from address to tract- Spatial cells: uneven distribution of population, and arbitrary division of space (boundaries pass right through buildings), and definitely nobody knows what S2 or H3 cell they live in.- Address: this option doesn't even make sense. Yes, you can geocode addresses, but you still need to aggregate by something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zip codes are just weird to use for anything other than mail in general because they’re set up based off infrastructure.CGP Grey has a great video on this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1K5oDtVAYzk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974728</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does everything need to be signed? Use a tool to much and you end up becoming it's slave.For a long time a had problems with some websites not loading videos when opened in background because I had an addon which disabled the page visibility api. 
So I download the source of the addon ( straight from the addons store right click the install button and save as..) changed the manifest to exclude the said sites, zip it back and install it again?Well your addon needs to be signed to be installed permanent even when you manualy install it. I understand that this is to keep tech-illiterate users safe from malicious addons. So is there a flag/about:config setting for advanced users to enable which skips the check? Nope, there was one but not anymore. So what options do I have? Either use beta version of Firefox as my main browser (no thanks). Or create an account as a developer, upload my addon and wait for Mozzila to check and sign my addon (that I created for myself).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I appreciate about being at Mozilla is that there are quite a few old-timers around, and that so much work always happens in public. A lot of institutional knowledge gets preserved that way!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting history. Signing software is neat, but I wish there were a single standard like HTTP. Instead, we have a fractal mess of GPG, Sigstore, Cosign, and package-specific solutions (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.), all doing their own thing.This makes me doubt how often these signatures are actually verified on client machines. For example, I've never done it manually because the process is so tedious. Some tools automatically check signatures, but even that is fragmented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42975436</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;Recent observations have revealed the presence of mysterious radiation belts surrounding Earth, which were detected following an intense solar storm. This phenomenon is attributed to the complex interplay between solar particles and the Earth's magnetic field, leading to unexpected radiation patterns. Scientists aim to understand the implications of these radiation belts on satellite operations and space weather, as well as their potential effects on the Earth's atmosphere. The study highlights ongoing challenges in predicting solar activity and its impact on Earth's environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how much the Van Allen radiation belts are a contributor to the Fermi paradox, i.e. how much they contributed to providing a suitable place for life to originate and flourish, and how rare they are.The belts themselves are an effect of Earth's magnetic field, which I believe is particularly strong because of flow within the Earth's liquid iron-nickel outer core. (I had long believed that the spinning of the inner core was the primary contributor but given a surface-level skim of the literature that doesn't seem to be the case; convection seems to be more of a driver.)I think perhaps many otherwise similar planets don't have a liquid iron core, so they may not have the strong radiation belts that shield life from the solar wind. Of course I am not sure what fraction of otherwise-similar planets have liquid iron cores, but Mars for example does not seem to. It is probably a function of the size of a planet (governing the pressure distribution in the interior), the ratio of iron to other elements, the temperature field (a function of the amount of radiogenic elements in the planet and its age), and perhaps other factors. Other planets may not be hot enough to have a liquid iron core at the right pressures, or be too massive (too much pressure) at the right temperatures, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A reason given for the dramatic increase in solar storm effects on Earth is that the Earth’s magnetic field is weakening. This is due to the current geomagnetic excursion where the location of the geomagnetic poles is changing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, so the 2 new belts (fields) are closer than the 2 stable existing belts (Van Allen Belts) that shield us from radiation.These fields could affect the launch and operation of satellites. Or maybe they will help shield us further? Or affect our atmosphere in some way? To be studied...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974727</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to the problem of density estimation, specifically focusing on the creation of a flexible statistical model that can adapt to complex data distributions. The authors propose a method that utilizes deep learning techniques to improve traditional density estimation, allowing for better accuracy and efficiency in capturing the underlying characteristics of diverse datasets. Their approach is demonstrated through various experiments, showcasing its effectiveness compared to conventional methods, thereby contributing to advancements in the field of statistical modeling and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some interesting points from this paper:- All simulated agents use the same neural net with the same weights, albeit with randomized rewards and conditioning vector to allow them to behave as different types of vehicles with different types of aggressiveness. This is like driving in a world where everyone is different copies of you, but some of your copies are in rush while others are patient. This allows backprop to optimize for a sort of global utility across the entire population.- There is no modeling of occlusion effects. Instead, agents are given the state of nearby agents, but corrupted by random noise. In the real world, occluded nearby agents can be extremely close (think about a child running out from behind a parked car). The paper comments on this.&gt; Both Waymax and nuPlan construct observations, maps, and other actors with auto-labeling tools from realworld perception data. This brings occlusion, incorrect or missing traffic-light states, and obstacles revealed at the last moment. Despite the minimalistic noise modeling in GIGAFLOW, the GIGAFLOW policy generalizes zero-shot to these conditions.- The resulting policy simulates agents that are human-like, even though the system has never seen humans drive. This is a great result when one considers other reinforcement learning projects produce extremely high performance agents  that humans would consider to be abusive or pathological.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting, and I have always thought this approach worth exploring given the "bitter lesson" in other ML domains, but I think we should be skeptical until we see such models deployed and operating effectively on real-world vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can there be "smart toys" for models that help them self-improve in a particularly efficient way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42968700</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the V8 blog discusses the implementation of the Math.random() function in JavaScript, emphasizing the importance of randomness in programming. It details the limitations of the traditional pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used in Math.random(), which can lead to predictable patterns. The blog introduces a new approach to generating random numbers that enhances randomness quality and security, outlining the technical improvements made to address issues such as bias and the need for stronger randomness in applications like cryptography. The article also illustrates the impact of these changes on performance and user experience in web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny to see this coming up again after all these years. I was the person who reported this issue to the Chromium team, 3 years before that blog posts. They marked it as won't fix, multiple times (other people reported it too), before they fixed it. Safari, Firefox, and IE were all already using more robust PRNGs for Math.random() that did not exhibit this issue.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9550796/why-is-google-ch...
https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40404440I came across it because of some tests I had for a statistics library I was working on. There was a test that created an array with 100k random values that shouldn't have had any collisions, but I consistently got multiple collisions, only in Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ah, the seed, an innocent implementation detail, but many people latch on to this and missuse random as a hash function. The one I remember was this screwball long term archival system from the early 2000's, zipped business archives on cd, the zip files were password protected. with the password being a hash of several factors about the data(unit, date, etc). A little stupid, but not the worst thing I have ever seen. The bad part was the hashing algorithm used, it was perls rand(). When I saw that I was vaguely horrified and a few test's confirmed my fears, the perl rand function would vary across operating systems and even different version of perl would change it. I think they ended up having to keep an explicit database of all the passwords just to have a fighting chance at opening those files later. not that they ever would. no one ever looks at long term records once they are stored.Anyway, I like how the openbsd folk fixed the old C rand family of functions. they made their seed functions do nothing and tied the generators to a strong kernel random source, that is, they made rand actually random. If your application actually depends on rand as a hash function they provided the old behavior under srand_deterministic(3)"Standards insist that this interface return deterministic results. Unsafe usage is very common, so OpenBSD changed the subsystem to return non-deterministic results by default."makes me laugh every time.http://man.openbsd.org/rand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xorshift is really cool because of how simple it is to comprehend and implement despite how well it works as a PRNG. The initial paper describing it, "Xorshift RNGs"[1], is surprisingly short and approachable, and I encourage anyone with any interest to read through it.[1]: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/download/v008i14/916&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42923000</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 60 Hz grid is why we have HDDs spinning at 7200 RPM. Because of 60 Hz, it was simpler to design AC electrical motors to spin at 3600 RPM or 7200 RPM (1x or 2x factor). When DC motors were made, for compatibility with AC motors, they often spun at the same speed (3600 or 7200 RPM) even though there was no electrical reason to do so. When HDD manufacturers selected DC motors for their drives, they picked 3600 RPM models as they were very common. Then, for performance reasons, in the 1990s, 7200 became more common than 3600 eventually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To cite the main origin:&gt; Stillwell recalled distinctly the final meeting of the committee at which this recommendation was agreed upon. They were disposed to adopt 50 cycles, but American arc light carbons then available commercially did not give good results at that frequency and this was an important feature which led them to go higher. In response to a question from Stillwell as to the best frequencies for motors, Scott said, in effect, “Anything
between 6,000 alternations (50 Hz) and 8,000 alternations per minute (67 Hz).” Stillwell then suggested 60 cycles per second, and this was agreed to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_powe... predates standardized 60 Hz, and still hasn't been converted (!!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974809</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unexpected properties of superconductivity in layered graphene, highlighting that this material exhibits strange behaviors that challenge existing theories. Researchers have found that at certain conditions, graphene can conduct electricity without resistance, but the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully understood. The findings could have significant implications for the development of new materials in electronics and quantum computing, prompting further investigation into the unique characteristics of graphene's superconductivity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physicist here. The superconductivity in layered graphene is indeed surprisingly strange, but this popular article may not do it justice. Here are some older articles on the same topic that may be more informative:https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-twisted-graphene-became-t...,https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-twist-reveals-supercond....Let me briefly say why some reasons this topic is so interesting. Electrons in a crystal always have both potential energy (electrical repulsion) and kinetic energy (set by the atomic positions and orbitals). The standard BCS theory of superconductivity only works well when the potential energy is negligible, but the most interesting superconductors --- probably including all high temperature ones like the cuprates --- are in the regime where potential energy is much stronger than kinetic energy. These are often in the class of "unconventional" superconductors where vanilla BCS theory does not apply. The superconductors in layered (and usually twisted) graphene lie in that same regime of large potential/kinetic energy. However, their 2d nature makes many types of measurements (and some types of theories) much easier. These materials might be the best candidate available to study to get a handle on how unconventional superconductivity "really works". (Besides superconductors, these same materials have oodles of other interesting phases of matter, many of which are quite exotic.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think everything we don't have a model for is surprisingly strange. Gravity only seems "normal" because we've been teaching a reasonable model for it for hundreds of years - Aristotle thought things fell to the ground because that was "their nature", but thought it quite weird. X-Rays seem bonkers unless you've grown up with them, and there is something deeply unnerving about genetics, quantum and even GenAI until you've spent some time pulling apart the innards and building an explainable model that makes sense to you. And even then it can catch you out. More ways to explain the models help normalise it all - what's now taught at 9th grade used to be advanced post-doc research, in almost every field. And so it goes on.2D superconductors don't make much sense because, as the article says, theory is behind experimentation here. That's also why there is both incredible excitement, but also a worry that none of this is going to stack up to anything more than a bubble. My old Uni (Manchester) doubled down hard on the work of Geim and Novoselov by building a dedicated "Graphene Institute", after they got the Nobel Prize, but even 15 years after that award most people are still trying to figure out what does it all actually mean really? Not just in terms of the theory of physics, but how useful is this stuff, in real world usage?It'll settle down in due course. The model will become apparent, we'll be able to explain it through a series of bouncing back between theory and experiment, as ever, and then it won't seem so strange any more.I'm not sure that'll ever be true of quantum computing for me, but then I am getting a bit older now...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My interest with these overlapping lattices is the creation of fractional electric charges (Hall effect) and through, essentially, Moiré patterns. The angle of alignment will make a big effect.Let me make an artifact to demonstrate… brb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42964124</guid></item><item><title>16.

Then the quantum backend would give you a yes or no answer.The idea here is that if you believe the many worlds interpretation then that quantum decision splits the universe in two, and in one universe you grow a beard, and in the other you don't.I thought it was a fun idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone that has basically zero background in quantum, is there some kind of "aha" thing I'm supposed to observe here?The details for what a quantum coin flip is has the description "your friends will think you're a wizard."Why?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh man this make me nostalgic!  My mothers sides family were from an area close/along the Chuo rapid line, west Tokyo probably exactly between Otsuki &amp; Shinjuku.Otsuki is actually not the most common final destination along Chuo Rapid Line, but Takao is. Takao is close to a popular hiking spot Takao mountain so there's definitely more stuff there compared to Otsuki.Probably the WORST "getting stuck at Chuo Rapid Line" is Actually mistakenly taking Chuo Line that transfer to Ome Line that could sometime go all the way to Okutama. There's literally nothing there, and you're deep in the mountain. There's so little light pollution there, that my sisters friend that live there told me that at night you can actually see the light pollution from Tokyo inner city from the east, and locals call it 煩悩の光 (The light of lust/carnal desires).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The freakiest thing to me is the Lawsons. This was a tiny little convenience store chain that existed in a few counties near Cleveland, OH. It went out of business around 1980, but through some baffling chain of events managed to migrate to Japan where they seem to be only slightly less common than 7/11s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most interesting to me is that the Chuo Line appears to have finally gotten its new rolling stock with Green Cars!  I went to high school in Tokyo and was slummin' it in the 201 series: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/201_series#/media/File:JR_EAST...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42945980</guid></item><item><title>18.

If we wrote out every matrix multiplication for linear regression, would we say we've truly grasped it? Is the takeaway about implementation mechanics, or does it build deeper intuition?I see the value in visualization, but what’s the real educational gain beyond that?(I'm an ML person/mathematician, but I haven’t lectured in over a decade—maybe I just don’t get it. I tend to prefer tutorials that build connections to known ideas, so this might be a blind spot for me.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the related topic to teach AI fundamentals and intuition of the inner workings, there is a wonderful material named "AI Unplugged"[1] to perform activities with pen/pencils, cards, etc. in a game manner.I've been using this material on several occasions with various audiences not familiar with the field of AI/ML (kids and grown-ups), and each time people seem to have been enjoying it and earning a bit of understanding of the modern world they live in.[1] http://www.aiunplugged.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can even build GPT-2 in Excel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjD2n_e9E3w&amp;ab_channel=Sprea...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42968547</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and inevitability of Rust's borrow checker in ensuring memory safety and preventing data races in concurrent programming. It explains how the borrow checker enforces rules about ownership and borrowing of resources, making certain programming patterns impossible but ultimately leading to safer and more efficient code. The author emphasizes that while the borrow checker can be seen as restrictive, its presence is crucial for the robustness of Rust, encouraging developers to adopt best practices in memory management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inko is an interesting language, though the handling for panics sounds disturbing. Based on the documentation, panics abort the whole program and are not recoverable.Things like dividing by zero or accessing an index outside of the bounds of an array will panic.While these aren’t incredibly common, I would never want my whole production web server to go down because some random, infrequently used endpoint had a bug in some edge case.The language seems heavily inspired by Erlang, which is very resilient to programmer errors in comparison.In Erlang, the philosophy is to let a lightweight process crash and restart it when there is a problem. This doesn’t need to have any effect on other lightweight processes that are running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article seems to use "borrow" to mean what I would normally understand to be the reference count of a refcount-gc system? Rather than a Rust borrow, which is part of the type system and not counted at runtime.In C# you can force a type to be stack allocated with "ref struct". https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-ref...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author introduces inline type definition. Shouldn't allocation strategy be decided by the caller, not type definiton? Or there is a way to heap allocate value of inline type by wrapping it into some utility type, similar to Rust's Box?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42966402</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the thing: I bet if you were to take the children who performed well at complex abstract mathematical problems and placed them in a job that required complex applied mathematical skill, the ones who eventually performed best would be the same. And vice-versa for the children who excelled at complex applied mathematics. So mathematical skill might not be immediately transferable, but would be a useful indicator of innate ability.This relates to the (somewhat controversial) economic theory that much of higher education is not about training or creating transferable skills, and instead is about "signaling". Essentially, we place children in simulated quasi-work settings and use it to determine who has the most of certain economically valuable abilities. By performing well at abstract mathematics, a child signals that they have the requisite mental ability to tackle similarly complex "real world" problems. But also, they signal that they are capable of obeying authority, working with diligence, delaying gratification, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run a microschool where I teach math (and I am a neuroscientist) and this is pretty obvious, and also something we see every day. And it's because we still suck at understanding learning.Learning is not the acquisition of knowledge. Learning is all the things by which we learn to model the world. And we do that, our brains do that, because it matters.Math in classrooms is pretty much designed to leach out all context. Meaningless symbols that need to be manipulated to arrive at some mysterious answers. Why bother, our minds scream out. The why is evident in street settings. Also, we are designed to pick up patterns in such meaningful settings and learn. You don't even need to teach it.Fixing learning and education means being able to articulate answers to five questions: why, what, how, when, where we learn. And all our current answers are outdated and one-size-fits-allThere is also the matter of learning design. Math we use is highly compact because of its efficiency. But these can be hostile starting out. There are ways to explore mathematical concepts without using mathematical symbols.Resonant learning requires the interplay of building competence (how) and comprehension (why) and this can be done well only in meaningful settings (where)https://blog.comini.in/p/why-khanmigo-will-failhttps://blog.comini.in/p/what-happens-in-math-classAlso, the most profound revelation I've had about learning is from working on our book. Journey of the Mind. Spent twenty years at the intersection of neuroscience and AI but never really got to "understand" and "learn" how the mind works and learns until diving in and then trying to tell its story in an accessible manner. If you are interested in any of this lease do check it out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm afraid that this is because academic math is often taught and tested in a way that rewards memorization rather than understanding.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article! I really love electro-mechanical designs from the birth of electronics up to the 1960s. Using a little hammer to strike two bells is such a simple, cool, and intuitive design. Today it would be replaced with a piezo buzzer or speaker which works, but isn't nearly as interesting.You don't really see cool little designs like that anymore - it's all almost all digital now. Though I will say YIGs and RF designs are pretty cool in terms of combining mechanical with electrical elements. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but I miss when electronics weren't so standardized. Tube amps, flip displays, tube displays, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In The Idea Factory (about Bell Labs) they describe another common method being to shout "Ahoy!" into the phone and hope that this gets the attention of someone near the receiving telephone. I just love the mental picture I get from that.On the other hand, this forced people to make written appointments for calls. Sometimes I wish that happened more often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a whole history of annunciators for summoning servants.[1] Bells, flags, meter needles, all pre-telephone.[1] https://1889victorianrestoration.blogspot.com/2011/09/everyt...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42926396</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Built my own expense tracker on top of Teable.I’m partly lucky because I live in Taiwan and almost any receipt here comes with itemised breakdown as a QR code, so I can scan that from my phone and pipe it off to a queue for ingestionDidn’t want to use LLMs, but wanted automated categorisation of transactions, did that with some vector embeddings and Semantic Router (https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router).… oh and it’s run off a RPi, yes the embeddings as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built my own similar tool for my wife and I, with the same goal of making entering transactions as fast as possible, and one thing I found useful was predictive form filling.Some categories have the same thing logged over and over (like for the "Gas" category I always made the title "Gas") so when you select the "Gas" category it prefills the title field with the most common transaction title for that category. Also works in reverse, if you enter the transaction title first it will guess the category.I also optimized the date picker. We budget month to month, so when you're in this month's budget, all you have to select is the day. No need to select month and year, as so many default date pickers do.Just some tidbits in case they interest you as well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like a solid project, will be interested in giving it a shotAside: I built my own expense tracker [1] as well to categorise expenses using LLMs as I needed a quick way to log the entries.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "MereoPhysics," which is an innovative framework that seeks to explore the intersection of physics and philosophy. It emphasizes the importance of integrating empirical data with theoretical constructs to foster a more comprehensive understanding of physical phenomena. The author highlights the limitations of traditional physics approaches and advocates for a multidisciplinary perspective that includes insights from various fields. Ultimately, the work encourages a deeper inquiry into the fundamental nature of reality through the lens of both scientific and philosophical inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting essay. Not sure it really provides insights into the problem spaces I'm interested in personally, but it's interesting to see a formal connection to mereology.One of the problems in many of these domains is that the potential higher-order interaction space is so large that it's impossible to make inferences about them (in an exploratory way at least). So in genetics for example, there's a lot of genes, and the number of potential combinations of causal factors is huge. Unless you have an a priori reason to think a particular P-way combination of factors is important, it's impossible to search for them because the resources required to make inferences about the P-way interactions exceeds any computational resources available to study them.This is kind of the idea of emergence, that at some point the information involved in representing a set of higher-order interactions becomes too great to actually represent, so we measure some property of the system that summarizes these interactions instead.I think the problem scientifically always is knowing whether that information required actually is too large, or whether we just don't understand what is exactly involved. Unknown unknowns or something like that, but where some of the unknowns might in fact be fundamentally unknowable.I've always found it might be useful to have an estimate of the predictability of some system from some level of analysis of predictors, so we at least know how much we can ever expect to explain from them. In some cases I think this might be doable and others impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great philosophical motivation for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_algebra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super incomplete thought: how does this point of view relate to Euler characteristic? Can I get to Euler characteristic by asking how to solve an equation for some quantities q in terms of some quantities Q?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42948642</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, Emil from the article here.I end-up doing part-time work for Google at the interaction of Art/Culture and ML doing project like this (https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-klimt-color-enig...), I saved up enough to build an ML rig (https://www.emilwallner.com/p/ml-rig), since I worked 2-3 days a week, I could spend the rest of my time doing research. I spent 1-2 years working on reasoning, trying different adaptive compute mechanisms and RL on code and mathematics (similar to R1/o1), however, I realised it was hard to compete with the established labs, and if I published my work it was hard to monetize it to have enough time to stop doing consulting work and fund my compute needs.Instead, I started researching AI colorization, and launched it as a side-project (https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/xe6avh...), I ended up having a few hundred thousand users in a few weeks and realized it had enough legs to bootstrap into a company. So I left my consulting gig at Google to go full-time on the colorization project (Palette: https://palette.fm/).Fast forward to today, Palette is still running with a healthy margin, I’ve outsourced most of the things and I can spend most of my time doing AI research. I’d love to publish and open-source more, but since it becomes too easy to copy, it makes it hard to fund myself and my compute needs.Happy to answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previous discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22101066IMO the confident Tweets about how to become a good researcher and hire good researchers look pretty weird next to the lack of any apparent research papers (or even visible research products) five years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42921493</guid></item><item><title>26.

Surely someone can replace CPU implementation with the one with full debug capabilities, and then use that to decrypt stored secrets?Turns out, there is no such thing as "stored secrets", and the device has no non-volatile memory at all, other than FPGA configuration (NVCM). The only secret is UDS, 256 random bits that are baked into FPGA configuration stream, and they are protected by FPGA's read-out protection. The mechanism that is normally used to prevent device duplication is instead used to protect cryptographic secrets. Replacing bitstream is all-or-nothing affair, so a hypothetical "CPU with debug capabilities" will not have access to UDS.This means all storage must be on PC and some classes of things are are absolutely impossible - for example an anti-bruteforce counter that clears secrets if too many wrong attempts are entered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Popular in:2023 (204 points, 78 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=387643532022 (305 points, 119 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32896580Note they've had a couple of security vulnerabilities https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39830553 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40055726&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42967474</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The extract looks great, I'll have to pick up the 3 books he mentions --- I love Armstrong.One thing that always amazed me about these jazz performers was how much they toured, even at the peak of their popularity. They went everywhere. A couple years ago I sat down with my grandfather when his health was fading and asked him to tell me his life-story, recording it for my father so that he would always have a record of his father's voice. My grandfather grew up in a middle of nowhere Canadian town, but it did have a pavilion in its town park. I just about lost it when my grandpa casually mentioned that he'd seen Armstrong play there 4 times(!) over the years. Nowadays, you'd be lucky if any band or act came to play in that town. But Armstong and his band came.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; After catching up on some sleep, Armstrong took advantage of his new private bath, got dressed, and went out for a long walk, stunned by the beautiful African American neighborhood he found himself in. “The reason why I was so amazed over South Parkway is because, such a street in New Orleans, with all those highpowered homes and apartments, nothing but white folks lived on a street like that... And nothing but the Filthy Rich ones at that,” he wrote. “I just could not get [over] the idea, that it was a little difference between the north and the south (a little differnt [sic] anyway) and the colored people were a little more respected and appreciated.”This part of Chicago peaked at a population of nearly 80,000 in 1950; it's now around 20,000: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas,_Chicago#Bronzeville&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gioia's own books are fantastic too. I highly recommend them all. "West Coast Jazz" is probably my favourite, a fantastic guide and history to so many great players who didn't get their due by dint of being on the "wrong coast".
"How to Listen To Jazz" and "History of Jazz" are fantastic, more general starting points.He and Garry Giddens are my two favourite jazz writers, hands down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42973897</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the launch of the Data.gov Archive, a new initiative to preserve and provide access to a vast array of public datasets previously available on Data.gov. It highlights the importance of government data transparency and accountability, emphasizing that the archive will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the public. The initiative aims to ensure that valuable datasets remain accessible even as new systems and challenges arise, reinforcing the commitment to open data and informed governance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great to see there's some resistance. What I'm missing from this announcement though is any mention of how they intend to secure this "vault" against the current government. I'm assuming good intentions on the part of Harvard, but keeping this data online against the express will of the government is gonna cost (political) capital. And from what I can see, the archive is hosted by US entities on US-controlled servers on US soil?This is the same thing that's been bothering me with archive.org lately, by the way. I haven't found a good way to simply (for some reasonable definition definition of "simple") contribute 10 TiB or so of redundant storage on my (european) home server either. That kind of thing might (have to) serve to ensure tamper-resistance for that data, given the current political climate on both sides of the pond. Any pointers welcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone out there archiving USGS/NOAA datasets ? It sounds ridiculous, but this appears to be where we are now. There is a submission about NOAA on the frontpage now: "Scientists on alert as NOAA restricts contact with foreign nationals" [1][1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42970814&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it assuming that the might of the American government -- in trying to take a bunch of data offline -- is being resisted by a digital "militia" of hobbyist archivers and non profits.Theres something that about this that just rings second amendment. Personally I think the concept of civilians having weapons to be a check on a nation state is absurd, but in this case it feels pretty empowering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42970039</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing importance of agent experience in customer support and service sectors, highlighting how enhancing the working conditions and tools available to agents can lead to better customer interactions and overall satisfaction. It emphasizes the shift from solely focusing on customer experience to recognizing that agent well-being directly impacts the quality of service they provide. The piece suggests implementing strategies such as better training, improved technology, and fostering a supportive work environment to empower agents, ultimately leading to a more effective and efficient service operation.&lt;/p&gt;

This provision requires large online platforms to provide researchers with immediate access to publicly available data on their platforms in order to assess systemic risks. The lawsuit has also helped clarify open legal questions regarding the judicial enforceability of this right in Germany.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Kill the User" discusses the concept of user-centric design in technology, emphasizing the need to prioritize users' needs and experiences. It critiques the tendency of tech companies to focus on profit over the well-being of their users, resulting in product designs that can manipulate or exploit individuals. The author advocates for a more ethical approach to technology development that considers the long-term impacts on users, urging designers and developers to create solutions that empower rather than harm users. Ultimately, the piece calls for a shift in perspective towards a more responsible and human-centered approach in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can see this in venerable software which has lived through the times of "designing for the user" and is still being developed in the times of "designing for the business".Take Photoshop, for example, first released in 1987, last updated yesterday.Use it and you can see the two ages like rings in a tree. At the core of Photoshop is a consistent, powerful, tightly-coded, thoughtfully-designed set of tools for creating and manipulating images. Once you learn the conventions, it feels like the computer is on your side, you're free, you're force-multiplied, your thoughts are manifest. It's really special and you can see there's a good reason this program achieved total dominance in its field.And you can also see, right beside and on top of and surrounding that, a more recent accretion disc of features with a more modern sensibility. Dialogs that render in web-views and take seconds to open. "Sign in". Literal advertisements in the UI, styled to look like tooltips. You know the thing that pops up to tell you about the pen tool? There's an identically-styled one that pops up to tell you about Adobe Whatever, only $19.99/mo. And then of course there's Creative Cloud itself.This is evident in Mac OS X, too, another piece of software that spans both eras. You've still got a lot of the stuff from the 2000s, with 2000s goals like being consistent and fast and nice to use. A lot of that is still there, perhaps because Apple's current crop of engineers can't really touch it without breaking it (not that it always stops them, but some of them know their limits). And right next to and amongst that, you've got ads in System Settings, you've got Apple News, you've got Apple Books that breaks every UI convention it can find.There are many such cases. Windows, too. And MS Word.One day, all these products will be gone, and people will only know MBA-ware. They won't know it can be any other way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written a short blog post "User is Dead" a while ago https://rakhim.org/user-is-dead/&gt; User is dead. User remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the developers, the designers, the growth hackers? What was holiest and the final judge of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our A/B-tests and new features. Who will wipe this blood off us? What garbage collector is there for us to clean ourselves? What conference of atonement, what disruptive technology, what sacred meeting shall we have to invent?Tasteless, but I felt, and still feel, like the notion of a user is truly lost. Somehow, the only technology which technically allows direct 1-many relationships between a small group of builders and a vast number of users, managed to create an industry which actively prevents and disincentives such relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve read a lot of articles like this over the past decade, and books, and papers. I agree with most of it: we need to bring technology back “to the people”. But everything I’ve read, including this, has two problems:1. Consistently, people reminisce about older tech that they loved, and wishing they could have stuff like that again. But the reality is that people like us, on HN, are not the average person. The tools we adored were great to us because we knew how to wield their power and felt empowered to do so. What parts of those applications could the broader population use easily?2. What should we be using to create personal/folk/situated software? How do we even accomplish this goal? Again, we (HN readers) know the tools and feel empowered. But for the ideas in this article to come to light, many more people need to be empowered to solve their own problems and tailor their tools to their needs. What technologies should they use? I never get a good answer to that one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42952798</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am from Myanmar and Shwe KoKo is the biggest scam hub of the world . Not just online scam they are operating all kind of illegal activities.Myanmar Junta is also part of that and china bordering Laukkai. Laukkai is now liberated and scammers arrested as revolution forces won. 
Shwe KoKo is last one to be eliminated .They advertise recruitment ads of 8000$ a month for working in IT so many youth went there , and forced to end up as sex slaves , scammers , sex cammers . Who refuse to work and try run away are organ harvested or trafficked to china.
They are very dark crime gang not limited to
- Human Trafficking.
- Organ Harvesting.
- Dark Web activities.
- Drug and Women abuses.The BGF Militia  of Saw Chit Thu is working with scammers  they have arm forces of 8000 handing that.In April 2023, Joint Revolution forces led by KTLA Lion Battalion : Saw Eh Say Wah launched an offensive against the Kayin State BGF in Shwe Kokko l . They almost captured Shwe KoKo and BGF (Saw Chit Thu) ran away to Thailand. But during the fight one sact of KNU (biggest rebel forces in Karen area who suppose to be helping KTLA ,but leaders also owns shares in Shwe KoKo ) betrayed KTLA forces and backstabbed Saw Eh Say Wah and KTLA Revolution forces. He barely escaped and estimated 200 of KTLA perished.Now China is pushing Thailand to shut down Shwe KoKo and elecriticy is now cut off. They are moving operartion more inside of Myanmar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a related note, POGOs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_offshore_gaming_ope...The Philippines (under Duterte) said to Chinese criminals: Feel free to base your operations here and rip off your fellow Chinese, but don't rip off us Filipinos.Then these POGO centres started scamming locals and Chinese alike, and staffed themselves with scam victims, using blackmail and torture to force them to work there and commit fraud.Then one victim escaped:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68562643And then the whole world unraveled for local town mayor and Chinese spy, Alice Guo (that's not even her real name)https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/asia/philippines-alice-gu...https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mnyrm8739o&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not just some scams. It's the darkest thing ever in the whole human history.After China banned using of death row organs around 2014, the world's largest organ black market has moved to southeast Asia. There are estimated more than 100k victims (mostly Chinese) annually. Some of them may be released, if their families can afford the ransom. The remaining victims are treated like livestock. They are forced into doing scams to lure more people. Their blood is drawn monthly or even weekly for sales. They'll be tortured to death, if they try to run away. And finally, their organs will be harvested and sold, which most likely will also be the end of their lives.United States once proposed to classify these organizations as terrorist organizations at UN but was denied by China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42971059</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the role of whitespace in HTML, explaining how it affects the visual rendering and structure of web pages. It highlights the different types of whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks, and their behavior in HTML documents. The piece covers common misconceptions about whitespace, such as its impact on the actual rendering versus the display in the source code, and offers best practices for using whitespace effectively in coding for improved readability and organization. Additionally, it addresses how to manage whitespace in different contexts, like inline and block elements, and outlines tools that can help developers work with whitespace more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;* All white space in HTML and XML is preserved verbatim.* HTML has a default presentation scheme that varies by interpreter. For everything else use CSS.* The default presentation of white space in HTML and XML is what is called tokenized space, which is that all consecutive white space characters are displayed as a single space character. Again, you can control this with CSS.* White space does not determine the behavior or display of other HTML tags.* White space is a text node in the DOM. If it is adjacent to other text that text and white space are one text node, otherwise the white space is its own text node.That should be all there is to it. JavaScript has absolutely no bearing on this subject.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expected an uninformed rant and actually got a really well informed, balanced rant. I don't agree that this is a major issue, but every time I thought of a counter argument it was immediately addressed in the article. Well done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part about &lt;aside&gt; is worded in a way that can be confusing. It implies that a &lt;div&gt; is always going to be displayed as a block, but an &lt;aside&gt; is some kind of special element that could be either a block or inline.Whether it's "inline", "block", or "inline-block" is determined by the CSS for every visual HTML element. A &lt;div&gt; is not a block, nor an &lt;a&gt; an inline, those are just the defaults and can be easily overridden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42969494</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;Recent research has discovered that the patterns of whale songs adhere to a universal law similar to those found in human language. The study suggests that these vocalizations exhibit structure and complexity, indicating that whales may communicate in a way that is more sophisticated than previously understood. This finding not only enhances our comprehension of whale communication but also highlights the intricate relationship between animal behavior and linguistic principles.&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote a trash paper too and I'm still angry about not feeling psychologically safe to bring the issue up.A postdoc who was there wrote a paper many years later about the right way to do ithttps://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062I don't think anybody read it.  Note that the Science paper uses the "Pearson product moment correlation" which is "can only be used to measure the relationship between two variables which are both normally distributed" -- and there's nothing normally distributed here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper:Inbal Arnon, et al. Whale song shows language-like statistical structure. Science 387, 649-653 (2025). DOI: 10.1126/science.adq7055https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7055Abstract: Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42971847</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes sense, good luck! I know that sounds snarky, I'm looking forward to rational progress and cooperation on the evolution and adoption of the standard. Just haven't seen that played out in such a planned orderly fashion yet (ipv6?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this article is more a buisness case presentation than a full demonstration of the field but the TR also misses some points.Why remove the refrences in the TR to frama-C, cbmc, etc. from the opinion report? They are easier to adopt than the heavier tooling of coq, etc. I'm always suprised to see those tools ignored or downplayed, when it comes to these discussions. I do agree with the TR's sentiment that we need to improve accessibility and understanding of these tools, but this is not a great showing for that sentiment.Additionally, both articles miss that compiler modified languages/builds are a path, such as fbounds-safety. They will be part of the solution, and frankly, likely the biggest part at the rate we are going. Eg. current stack defenses for C/C++/Rust, unaddressed in safe language design, are compiler based. The compiler extension path is not particularly different than cheri, which requires a recompile with some modifications, and the goal of both approaches is to allow maintainers to band aid dependencies with minimal effort.The TR handwaves away the question of the complexity of the development of formal method tools for Rust/Unsafe Rust and C++. Ie. rust really only has two tools at the moment: miri and kani (which is a cbmc wrapper). Heavier tools are in various states of atrophying/development. And C++ support from the c family of formal tools such as frama-C, is mostly experimental. It's not assured, that with the continued language development rate of both languages and the complexity of the analysis, that the tools for these languages will come forth to cover this gap anytime soon.I do not think the claim in the TR that the current unsafe/safe seperation will result in only requiring formal analysis of the unsafe sections is true, as logical errors, which are normal in safe rust, can cross the boundries to unsafe and cause errors, thus nessecitating whole program analysis to resolve if an unsafe section could result in errors. Perhaps it will decrease the constants, but not the complexity. If rust does further restricts perhaps more of the space could be covered to help create that senario, but the costs might be high in both usability and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the most under appreciated things about the JVM is its well-defined memory model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42962020</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think both of these projects miss what makes TikTok (and reels in general) so effective.A good TikTok video gets "injected into your brain". You have zero effort to provide and suddenly this stuff is in your mind. I'm not saying it's a good thing, I realize the danger, but that's the core mechanism.A friend in marketing describes this in terms of "brain calories". Eg if people have to think in order to understand your landing page, you failed to communicate your ideas efficiently, as it "requires too many brain calories". TikTok content requires zero brain calories.One could say that only very shallow information could be spread this way (eg people dancing, video game clips) but I'm not sure that's true. The real challenge would be to turn an arbitrary source of information (wikipedia, hn) and make it immediately graspable. I suspect modern AI models could already go quite far in this direction.Veritasium is a good example of interesting yet very graspable content:
https://www.tiktok.com/@veritasium/video/7329576935317622058&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it generate a short video for every thread, with a summary of the subject and some of the quarrels in the comments section and you're set. Make sure it uses all the ridiculous shenanigans tiktok users resort to, as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make it truly hell, you need AI help:Generate a scantily clad anime furry dancing for 30 seconds while talking about summarized HN content (SSH, Rails, React, etc.) narrated by a seductive female AI voice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946918</guid></item><item><title>37.

Unlike in code, the computations need to be established not only conceptually but spatially. I did some very crude versions myself for a simple NN on the XOR problem prior to implementing my own NN stack on GPGPU compute shaders for Unity and used the numbers as references to make sure my calculations were correct, but my spreadsheets were no where near as beautiful or correct as these. Well done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NN computations -- in the main -- are high school Maths. Architectures are a topology governing chains of high school Maths. This is so much the case that the building blocks can neatly be expressed in a spreadsheet, which may or may not help some people establish more mechanical sympathy for what is going on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok I'm going to be the one to ask - what exactly are we looking at?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42967173</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the challenges and possibilities of life's existence in environments with minimal light, such as deep-sea ecosystems and subterranean habitats. It discusses how organisms adapt to extreme darkness, utilizing bioluminescence, chemical processes, and unique metabolic pathways. The piece highlights the resilience of life and the various strategies that different species employ to thrive despite the absence of sunlight, ultimately raising questions about the limits of life's adaptability and the potential for life in similar extreme conditions beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting fact I learned from an evolutionary biologist is that when there's a gap in suitability life has a tendency to rapidly evolve and adapt to that gap.That's why after mass extinction events, we see explosions in evolution in creatures that had essentially stagnated.  Mammals being the best example of this.  They went from being small little creatures with little distinction for generations to everything from a mouse to a mammoth.  It wasn't until the rapid extinction of the dinosaurs with all the environmental gaps that created that we saw an explosion of different creature types.  There were niches to fill.This is likely part of the reason we see life in such extreme conditions.  There was a hole to fill and the creatures best suited to survive in that niche did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Most of life’s engines run on sunlight.There's a huge amount of life that runs on zero sunlight and instead runs on chemical energy deep in the earth. It makes up maybe 10% to 20% the biomass on earth and a good chunk of its biodiversity and is quite likely where life originated, hundreds of millions of years before photosynthesis evolved. It also quite possibly exists in a similar way on Mars.An interesting example is D. audaxviator, which runs on uranium and is named after a passage in Jules Verne’s “Journey to the Center of the Earth.”A lot of it has been discovered fairly recently - there's an unusually interesting nyt article on it all, including how they may transform rocks and continents https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/magazine/earth-geomicrobi... or https://archive.ph/VgzKD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life existed before photosynthesis. Taking electrons from H2S and oxidizing H2 coming out of hydrothermal vents.
Photosynthesis allowed primitive cells to venture out of those vents and into the world.Therefore, it's hardly a surprise that "life finds a way" :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42970397</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sort of flipped between “boring” to “..interesting..” to “maybe boring?” To “possibly interesting?” Reading this.The meaning of the title is simply that models from most providers can do some self-reflection when prompted to do so, without any R1-Zero type fine tuning.This is put out as surprising, and I do not think that it is surprising at all. We’ve known about Chain of Thought type prompting for some time, and this is a variant of it.They then mention that 1.5B-ish parameter models don’t seem to be very good at self reflection out of the box. This does not surprise me in the slightest. Unless heavily distilled and tuned for a very specific job, 1.5B parameter models aren’t good at much.They then note that something about the reward functions in R1 Zero’s setup create a typical pattern of shorter and shorter self-reflection until some sort of inflection point where the reflection gets longer, and correct answers are more common.This seems pretty interesting! The so-called “Aha” moment is when a model during training hits this inflection point and starts productively using and extending the self-reflection.I think my reaction overall is that the research is worth doing, as it’s trying to get at what exactly works about R1-Zero training, and why it works, and that’s great. It’s just a small start though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The essence of the article is that self-correction exists as a nascent ability in base models already (more robustly in some like Qwen than others). This is highly reminiscent of Chain of Thought, which was found to be a capability already present in base models too. The result of RL is to reinforce already present authentic self-correction patterns and down weight superficial self-correction.Thoughts:- An analogy you shouldn't zoom too close into is going from CoT to reasoning traces is like going from purely ballistic trajectories to including navigation and thrusters. RL is for learning how to use the thrusters for adjustments based on its internal encodings of rare samples† where some author fully spelled out their thought process.- This might also explain why SFT on reasoner traces seems to be surprisingly effective. If it were purely an RL mediated phenomenon, SFT for reasoning would not work nearly as well.- Deepseek struggled to get RL to work on smaller models, if this is replicated, it might be the case that larger models encode self-correction patterns more robustly while having them as more probable.- Imitating traces is easier than pure RL for bringing such patterns to the fore, for smaller models. However, we still want models to learn how to dynamically adjust their thrusters, SFT does not provide ample opportunity for this. Further training with RL or alternatively, replacing SFT with methods like [Critique Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17703) are needed.- The article incidentally reinforces that having a low temperature means consistency not correctness. Except for high confidence scenarios, the highest greedily computed probability answer is generally less likely to be among the best ones the model can give.†Question: First thought is blogs by people who discuss what didn't work. But, I wonder how much of reasoning model patterns and ability is shaped by Detective Conan transcripts?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;We found Superficial Self-Reflection (SSR) from base models’ responses, in which case self-reflections do not necessarily lead to correct final answers.I must be missing something here. No one was arguing that the AI answers are correct to begin with, just that self-reflection leads to more correct answers when compared to not using the process ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42969605</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is well-studied problem, and trying to make your own solution from scratch you'll often miss the efficient solutions.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_connectivityTo adjust the terminology:* cells are vertices* the path between adjacent cells that are both not obstacles are edges* adding an obstacle means removing all its edges* removing an obstacle means adding edges for each adjacent cell that isn't also an obstacle* it's illegal to end up with multiple components (edit: rephrased for correctness) other than obstaclesPersonally I've only done the "add edges" direction (which is much simpler).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless I'm missing something, this can be done in O(n) time by tracking the connected components of wall (diagonally touching walls are connected). Placing a new wall creates an enclosed region if and only if it touches 2 separated sections of wall that are part of the same component.The union-find disjoint sets algorithm can find whether they're in the same component. If a wall is added, it should be unioned with all adjacent walls. If a wall piece is removed, the components it was part of need to be recalculated, but it looks like that shouldn't happen more than once per frame.In this case, the lookups of the union find algorithm will never take more than O(n) overhead per frame while checking all of up to n possible wall positions.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a very nice writeup, in game engines, they often cache a “nav mesh” that indicates how one point can go to basically any other point. As the author, mentioned, finding a path to a known outer point validates that the point has not been enclosed, so it seems like this could be solved efficiently with a cached pathfinding algorithm
 I’d also consider forming a graph from the grid cells and using a max flow algorithm, these are very fast!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in performing optical character recognition (OCR). It highlights that while LLMs excel in natural language processing tasks, they struggle with accurately interpreting images of text due to their lack of inherent image processing capabilities. The piece delves into issues such as the models' reliance on textual data, which hinders their performance with visual inputs, and emphasizes the need for specialized computer vision techniques to enhance OCR accuracy. Overall, it argues that combining LLMs with advanced image recognition technologies could lead to improved results in interpreting written content.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took a picture of a grocery list and then pasted it into ChatGPT to have it written out and it worked flawlessly...until I discovered that I'd messed up the picture when I took it at an angle and had accidentally cut off the first character or two of the bottom half of the list.ChatGPT just inferred that I wanted the actual full names of the items (aka "flour" instead of "our").Depending on how you feel about it, this is either an absolute failure of OCR or wildly useful and much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good and useful to see empirical analyses like this. I use open &amp; custom VLMs a lot. The point of VLMs is that OCR is not needed anymore: it's intrinsic to the model.
For instance at work we've developed a family vision-based RAG, and it's performance is twice that of a text-based one. 
The point I'd like to make here is that OCR is an intermediate step that is not explicitly needed anymore, un many cases.
My hunch is that pure OCR will go away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case any scientist actually working on adaptive OCR is reading this, I was given a post-WWII newspaper archive (PDF scans, 1945-2006, German language) that I would like to OCR with the highest quality, compute demands are not an issue, I've got an army of A100s available.I played with OCR post-correction algorithms an invented on method myself in 1994, but haven't worked in that space since.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like author never heard about single pointer double linked list. That could save him 2 pointers per each node.The idea: for simplicity taking list. single pointer saved in the node is xor of next and previous nodes. When moving forward we xor current ptr with prev. Moving backward xor with next to get prev. That it. How do we get prev/next for xor? The only way to get in the middle of the list is using iterator. Which can hold one extra pointer. For the first/last nodes extra pointer is NULL.The same for EB tree, as navigation can be done only using iterator it can hold extra pointer.These are my $0.02, you are free to implement and use this algorithm. No fees, no references required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the problem this was designed for, what this is missing is an argument for why this is better than a heap with a last-resort ordering trivially added. (If you're not using this for a scheduler of course a heap doesn't make sense.)Note that C padding can be unfortunate here; for some types (but not when `sizeof(key) == sizeof(pointer)`) it may make sense to pack `bit` (in the generic struct; this does not need a whole `int` even) and `key` (in the type-specific struct) into the same word. I think `bit` needs `bitsizeof(key) + bitsizeof(max_dups)` values, so you only need 7 bits (log2(64+64)) at most (hmm, that's almost small enough to try cramming into the low bits of the pointers again ...).I forget if pointer-bit stuffing is actually defined in C, or if you should be using `uintptr_t`. Debugging is probably saner if you do regardless.It appears that this is intended to be used intrusively (in which case the value also needs to think about padding), but this completely fails to use the appropriate vocabulary. In fact, I think that might be the only difference between this and a typical bit-oriented radix trie? If so, Wikipedia is completely correct to delete this, since in general any node-based container can be made intrusive quite trivially.Using absolute indexes (against a known origin) is probably saner than relative-pointers if you have something simple enough, since it lacks the problem of moving/copying.Despite those considerations, this is definitely worth reading if you're interested in data structures (unlike some articles that get posted occasionally, which can be blogspam or outright incorrect).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; EB trees heavily rely on bit-addressable data (typically integers)That seems like a disavantage, but actually most data is bit-addressable in one way or the other; even strings, if you look at the UTF-8 representation.What I'm a bit worried is the number of levels: it seems to be 1 level per bit in the key. And "a tree node is typically 20-bytes long on a 32-bit system". So that is 20 bytes per bit in the key. I wonder if the memory usage could be reduced in a simple way. For example using larger "pages" that contain arrays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42947973</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was going through a rough time and SSRIs weren't helping, read all the research on what other solutions were out there. Psilocybin seems to be the most effective but is only legal in Oregon and price quotes were $3,500 for one session. Ketamine coupled with TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was the second. Since both are legal and my insurance covered them, opted to choose these. I will say that the various meta-analyses have some conflicting results.TMS seemed to be pretty effective for me. It feels incredibly silly to have your brain zapped and is a big time commitment (30 days, 1X a day for 10 minutes) but I can't argue with the results.Ketamine was something else. I did it intravenously, which seemed to be the best way to manage dosage but required going into a clinic. The biggest downside to the whole treatment is that you'll be very drowsy and sometimes down after, and all I wanted to do was go to bed. Taking the Uber home is not pleasant. The esketamine nasal sprays allow you to do it at home at lower dosages.Once you get over the feeling of leaving your body, it can be quite nice. Overall, it led to unblocking some life time hold ups I had, and made me a better person. I had 5 sessions, 4 of them were overwhelmingly positive. The last was a dark couple hours where I hyperfocused on all my internal fears and failures. It also led to a lot of existential thoughts and questioning the fabric of reality which isn't all bad in small doses. I can see how excessive use could start to be counterproductive, it's good to stay connected to this reality. I don't understand how people use this as a party drug.I would absolutely recommend it in a controlled setting for limited treatment, but would caution those with addictive personalities to be careful, not to see it as a silver bullet or a crutch, to make sure you're in a neutral mental space and that you're comfortable wherever you're doing it. In tandem, I listened to a fair amount of buddhist podcasts from Joseph Goldstein that helped build out the spiritual/learning side.I'd like to see psylocibin treatment be more readily available at a lower price across the nation as an alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you find this appealing, make sure to do it with a medical professional. If you still want to try it by yourself, read Felix Hill's suicide note first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I underwent this treatment (Esketamine) a few years ago. I found the acute effects (the "trip") right after taking it quite unpleasant. But as the treatment went on, my mental state improved dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974882</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m somewhat “rude” in my code comments and was tripped up by this last month… took me a while to figure out while on that specific file autocomplete would stop working
 https://bsky.app/profile/giorgio.azzinna.ro/post/3lecq3v5gts...Not to mention, there’s apparently some research saying code with swear words has higher quality, so if AI causes some decline there, we now know why it is https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/110mj6p/open_s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The news is that it actually started working again some time ago. Indeed, this:    (cl-defstruct person gender)
    (make-person :gender "m&lt;|&gt;")

with cursor at &lt;|&gt; does elicit "male" completion. Yay for normalcy?(Though honestly, I didn't notice this earlier - Copilot tends to hang for me too often in all kinds of files for me to identify these stopwords.)(EDIT: gotta admit though, this is hilarious: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/72603#discussi...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems to work again. But how does this happen in the first place. How could someone possibly have thought "hey I have an idea, let's put in a list of english words and just silently stop working if we have see even one of them in a substring". And people in this meeting would nod and say "yeah that sounds like an easy safety fix, let's do that". This just feels odd. This isn't a piece of forum software written by a 14 year old this is a company worth billions and filled with smart people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42971279</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried it with a paragraph of English taken from a formal speech, and it sounded quite good. I would not have been able to distinguish it from a skilled human narrator.But then I tried a paragraph of Japanese text, also from a formal speech, with the language set to Japanese and the narrator set to Yumiko Narrative. The result was a weird mixture of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese readings for the kanji and kana, all with a Korean accent, and numbers read in English with an American accent. I regenerated the output twice, and the results were similar. Completely unusable.I tried the same paragraph on ElevenLabs. The output was all in Japanese and had natural intonation, but there were two or three misreadings per sentence that would render it unusable for any practical purpose. Examples: 私の生の声 was read as watashi no koe no koe when it should have been watashi no nama no koe. 公開形式 was read as kōkai keiji instead of kōkai keishiki. Neither kanji misreading would be correct in any context. Even weirder, the year 2020 was read as 2021. Such misreadings would confuse and mislead any listeners.I know that Japanese text-to-speech is especially challenging because kanji can often be read many different ways depending on the context, the specific referent, and other factors. But based on these tests, neither PlayAI nor ElevenLabs should be offering Japanese TTS services commercially yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason, most of these (and other narration AIs) sound like someone reading off a teleprompter, rather than natural speaking voices. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but I'm left feeling like the speaker isn't really sure of what the next words are, and the stresses between the words are all over the place. It's like the emphasis over a sentence doesn't really match how humans sound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the tech. I hate that it gets used to fill YouTube with zero-effort slop. I don't have a solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42925110</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to set up and use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for remote development using SSH, highlighting the advantages of this workflow. It provides step-by-step instructions for connecting to remote servers via SSH from VSCode, including configuring the necessary settings, using the Remote - SSH extension, and troubleshooting common issues. The post emphasizes the improved productivity and flexibility developers can achieve by leveraging this remote development setup, allowing them to code directly on their servers while utilizing the powerful features of VSCode.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been for like a month now noodling on a long-form post about a piece of software we've been noodling with for 3-4 years now. Kurt is freaking out, because we haven't written anything on the blog since, like August. Finally I'm like, look, I will write the simplest thing I can come up with. We'll do the opposite of what we've been doing. We'll do anti- effortposts. I bet I can do one in 30 minutes.I promise, I thought about this less than you have. It's a thing we were tinkering with, and I wrote about it. That's all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more I learn about how VSCode works the more it seems like it's held together with duct tape and the most cursed ideas a JS developer could come up with.Even just from the SSH extension - the workspace URIs have two formats: essentially just the hostname and hex-encoded JSON documents. The latter case happens when additional info is needed, e.g. specific username, or... The hostname includes an uppercase letter.Which is actually necessary because when they're saved to recent workspaces they're lowercased for whatever reason.The SSH connections also support configuring extensions that are to be installed on the server, but don't go too crazy with it or you won't be able to connect to Windows hosts, since they're passing them ass command line arguments via CMD, which has a 8191 character limit (they're using CMD to call... PowerShell...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is going to sound naive but, I don't understand what the security issue is. If you can ssh into a machine and port forward a socket, you already have permission to do all the other things. VSCode's protocol seems to be exposing it in way that's more convenient for them.How is this a security problem? Is it because someone on the same network as the remote machine but without SSH access can connect the port that is forwarded over SSH?As a user, I quite like how well VSCode's SSH system works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979467</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool to load HN and see this.I was on Hotline's founding team in the 90s that joined with Adam Hinkley to promote and grow Hotline -- here's a press release I wrote for Hotline's appearance at Macworld Expo SF '98: https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Hotline_MacWorld_Expo_1998
(That site has lots more Hotline related archival stuff at https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Category:Hotline )Fun memories.  We of course on the Hotline team used Hotline itself to keep in touch with each other around the world -- at that point, Adam in Australia and the rest of us across the US and Canada. Fun antics in the group chat. =)It was a really fun time.  At its peak Hotline went on to be used by millions, and even by companies like Apple, GM, and Avid.  I particularly loved the Toronto Star quote that called Hotline "a major force in the online world" at the time.These days I work for the Computer History Museum and have lots of Hotline stuff adorning my cubicle :) )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hotline was life-changing software for me.  It was pretty niche, being Mac-only, and its BBS-like nature meant each server had its own culture and "cliques" and community.  Getting an account on certain servers (rather than being a lowly guest) was a noteworthy moment.  I remember a couple really badass servers like one called "JADE: where some guys in a university hosted a Hotline server on the uni's insanely fast connection.  I want to say it was an OC-12 connection (600mbit)?  This was in like, 1998.I still have a few friends from those days, one of whom I talk to almost every day.  Unfortunately one friend I met on Hotline passed away unexpectedly this past July.  I never would have expected to be making decades-long connections when I was just a kid looking for "filez" to download.  &lt;3Actually that same friend gifted me his old PC which was my first Windows machine. An amazing and kind gesture which changed the course of my life (I had grown up only with Macintosh systems until then).Further, I found music on Hotline that I would never have found otherwise.  I didn't find much on IRC (didn't know where to look) but I made connections with people on Hotline which resulted in me being exposed to amazing music from all over the world -- another life-changing experience. Too awesome :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hotline was the greatest single platform for the Macintosh in the 1990s. First Class was great, but Hotline was SO simple, you just pop in a tracker address, fire up the server, point it at 1 folder on your HDD and yer out there, as a pirate BBS server host on the internet hosting those brand new things, MP3's and those wildly hard to gather NES roms, or that illicit copy of Adobe Photoshop 4.5.Hotline took the AOL script kiddies from #Zelifcam and put them on the real big boy Internet without any restrictions or repercussions. It was glorious time. I still have a Big Red H necklace given to me by the I-forgot-his-name author of the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42959841</guid></item><item><title>3.

Good design is innovative
     2. Good design makes a product useful
     3. Good design is aesthetic
     4. Good design makes a product understandable
     5. Good design is unobtrusive
     6. Good design is honest
     7. Good design is long-lasting
     8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail
     9. Good design is environmentally-friendly
    10. Good design is as little design as possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opposite anecdote, in the 2000s, I worked at a company that had dozens of computers running jobs, built out a server room with raised floors and built out a SAN to store a whopping 3 TB of data and we had a home grown VB6 job scheduler that orchestrated jobs across the computers running Object Rexx scripts.We had our own internal load balancer, web servers, mail servers, ftp servers to receive and send files, and home grown software.Now I could reproduce the entire setup within a week at the most with some yaml files and hosted cloud services.  All of the server architected is “abstracted”.  One of the things he complains about.As far as backwards compatibility, worshipping at the thrown of backwards compatibility is one reason that Windows is the shit show it is.  Even back in the mid 2000s there was over a dozen ways to represent a string when programming and you had to convert back and forth between them.Apple has been able to migrate between 5 processors during its existence by breaking backwards compatibility and even remove entire processing subsystems from ARM chips by removing 32 bit code compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of these points are opposites of each other, so much so that it seems intentional. We’re to maintain backward compatibility, yet eschew complexity.We’re to reinvent the wheel for ourselves instead of relying on huge dependency trees, yet new languages and frameworks (the most common form of wheel reinventing) are verboten.The only way I can think to meet all these demands is for everyone (other than you, of course) to stop writing code.And I gotta say, a part of me wishes for that at least once a day, but it’s not a part of me I’m proud of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983275</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "do nothing scripting," which allows individuals to gradually transition towards full automation in their work processes. It emphasizes the importance of incremental changes, where users can script simple tasks without feeling overwhelmed. The approach encourages the automation of repetitive responsibilities in a way that feels manageable and less intimidating, thus improving productivity and efficiency over time. By gradually implementing scripts, workers can tailor automation to their needs and develop proficiency in using automation tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I like this in theory, I think it would have trouble in practice. If an ops team is doing the same task over and over, and they see the do-nothing script does nothing, they will quickly stop using it once they think they’ve memorized the steps, or if they think it’s faster (or more interesting) to do it manually.I’ve written a lot of automation and documentation for ops teams and getting them to use it, and use it constantly, has always been an issue. Doc changes also needed announcements, as people quickly stop reading them once they know how to do something.In a perfect world, I think the approach makes a lot of sense, and I might even use it for some personal stuff. In practice the world is rarely perfect, and I think I’d only employ this if 90% was automated, but there was still 1 step I couldn’t quite get… and even then, I could see some members on the ops team skipping the manual step and assuming the whole thing is automated and magic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a big fan of this approach.In general it's another way of defining interfaces around processes. Those processes may be manually done or automated. But the interface can remain the same - this is quite powerful when it comes to automating steps.It's the same as you'd do with another system really.I've used this before with Google sheets being manually filled in -&gt; automated with a script. And with Jira tickets being raised and then automatically picked up and processed. It lets you get started sooner, automated the most annoying parts and you never have to fully do it.Side benefit of do nothing scripts is that they can remain up to date more often as they can be more likely to be actually used than reading the docs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this approach. I already like doing this in systems above a certain complexity made with programming languages too. I think the functional programming community calls this "holes"?Interface "not implemented" errors follow a similar logic but I honestly think the value of writing something trivial that gives a meaningless but valid output for each of a bunch of pieces that depend on each other goes a long way toward expediting the process of building those pieces. It makes it much more likely you can test and build one thing at a time and not need to write a bunch of separate parts before you can test any of themHaving this type-wise validity matter in scripting contexts is sometimes harder, as in the use case described in the article, as a lot of the effects of command lines are going to be "side effects" from a functional perspective, but it being sequential makes this a lot less impactful and the waiting prompts make it so you can still preserve order of tasks at the low cost of needing manual steps you'd be doing without the script anywayScaffolds are incomplete but they're still, fundamentally, useful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42976698</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some years ago in a very idle moment I was searching for a place on Earth where you could anchor an hypothetical space elevator.You'd need a place near the equator, preferably unsettled but still politically stable. A mountain would be nice to shorten the length, but mountains are difficult.For my internal fantasy I settled on Ascension Island, part of a British Overseas Territory, at 7.5° South.It's not natively settled, the only people there are for work, military, spooks, space agencies for tracking and telecommunications. With the arrival of European explorers there was an ecological extinction, mostly the island seems to be barren.And the name, of course, is perfect for a space elevator fantasy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When they mention the Sentinelese who inhabit North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean as being uncontacted they have to ignore the shipwreck in the inlet on the northwest end of the island.I'm guessing that the mariners who found themselves on the island did not make a very good first impression as representatives of the larger outside world and that this contributed to the hostility towards outsiders that the Sentinelese exhibit.I know there was a bible-thumper a few years back who found himself skewered while trying to help the North Sentinelese find Jesus. That seems like a predictable outcome when you consider that the inhabitants have to be closer to everything that is real and important on their island than we modern people will ever be and likely have their constructs about how the world works so they don't need someone else's Jesus to keep them grounded.Interestingly enough, the only place where I saw any clear indication that the island was inhabited was on the north end of the island near the inlet where the ship is run aground and sunk. Just north of the tree line you can clearly see a well-worn path leading from the woods east of the wreck to the inlet.I'll bet they keep a weather eye out for any new contraptions not of their own making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was very interesting info and the site design is awesome.We always dream of going to distant planets and stars but Earth itself has so many weird, beautiful, and interesting places.I’ve added “living for an extended period of time, eg a year on Devon Island” to my list of To Do Someday list! Sure, it drops to -50C, but living there alone would be closest to being The Martian.Is there any way to live there self sufficiently you think? Assume you have money to buy latest tech and bring it there: a few m^2 of solar cells, battery, small hut made of highly insulating material. What else?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42978199</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Voronoi diagrams, which are used to partition a plane into regions based on the distance to a specific set of points. It explains the mathematical principles underlying Voronoi diagrams, their applications in various fields such as geography, urban planning, and biology, and provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and visualize Voronoi diagrams using programming techniques. The author also highlights the importance of Voronoi diagrams in optimization problems and spatial analysis, making them a valuable tool in both theoretical research and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made an implementation in clojurescript that animates the algorithm as it goes a while back: https://voronoi.ajwerner.net/#/app-diagramsIt’s a very beautiful algorithm.However, after that project I sort of came to dislike Fortune’s algorithm because it isn’t numerically stable with floating point numbers. If you have points that are colinear, or nearly colinear in fp, things can break. The delaunator is better in this regard iirc: https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an implementation of that algorithm in JS by Raymond Hill (of uBlock Origin fame):https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-VoronoiI toyed with it here to have it move:https://animations.adgent.com/voronoi.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years back I made this 3d visualisation https://x.com/KangarooPhysics/status/1253336959755251716&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42982015</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the development of the PlayStation 2's backwards compatibility feature, as shared by the engineer who created it. It explores the technical challenges faced in making the PS2 able to play original PlayStation games, the innovative solutions implemented, and the impact this feature had on the gaming experience. The piece provides insight into the engineering processes, design decisions, and the importance of backwards compatibility in maintaining a strong gaming ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the PS2’s success in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it interesting that the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) also was backwards compatible with the Sega Master System.Inside the Genesis they had the hardware for the Master System, which included the original Z80, the original sound chip. The Genesis graphics chip was evolved from the Master System and could work in Master System mode. You needed a cartridge adapater.The other surprising thing is that you could actually run the Z80 in parallel with your 68000 when running a Genesis game. We used the Z80 as a sound co-processor running MIDI and playing sampled drums without bothering the 68000.On the PS2 system's PS1 backwards compatibility this pattern is quite similar, not mentioned in the blog posts is that the IOP which acts as the PS2's sound co-processor contains an R3000 like the PS1 and it's underclocked to directly run the PS1 titles.Apparently on later editions of the PS2 Slim they removed the R3000 based IOP and replaced it with a PowerPC microcontroller!  It had to fully emulate the R3000 and the SPU as far as I know to fufill the IOP duties including the PS1 emulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previously:- 2023: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34944067- 2020: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22501566&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So is that emulation software-base, not hardware-base, or half half? If its half half, consider several games won't work, what's the big difference with real PS1 hardwares in terms of gaming experience？&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42931241</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work! I'm happy to see the server is in Dart, no Firebase!I wish the Dart server ecosystem was more mature though. Being able to compile Dart into a static binary is so nice for deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool! Somewhat similar, I recently bought a Nintendo Switch version of Ticket to Ride, which supports using a "companion app" on other devices to show each player their private hand.However, one unfortunate bit is that the board (in my case, the TV connected to the Switch) is "read-only" and you don't interact with it, unlike real life. You pick which card to play on your phone, and then place it onto the board also on your phone. So basically, all the action is on your phone, and the central board is kind of an afterthought. It doesn't feel as much like interacting with a shared space as I was hoping.I'm not really sure how to solve that. I thought of some weird stuff (like, maybe after you pick your card, your phone is just a touchpad controlling the card as it now moves around on the big screen) but nothing seemed practical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When VR was starting to gain attraction, I had this idea of a virtual playing card deck. Everybody joining the game could move the phone around to see the virtual cards either on their hand or on the surface chosen as the "table". The idea came from the need to play cards in the hall of college department without showing that we were playing cards.Unfortunately, my college education did not equip me enough skills to make that happen. I'm glad that somebody else made this. Looks very nice!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983699</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a presentation from FOSDEM 2025 focused on the collaborative efforts of various Linux distributions to achieve reproducible builds. The goal of reproducible builds is to ensure that software can be built in a manner that yields identical binaries from the same source code, enhancing security and trust in the software supply chain. By joining forces, these distributions aim to improve the integrity of their software and foster community collaboration, ultimately benefiting users and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reproducibility changes everything, because nothing changes. We go from shamans chanting incantations over a blessed code base to a mathematical function with an algebra of system composition.Let me give you the simplest example, when builds are reproducible you don't need package repositories, you need build caches.All the problems with maintaining a repository (save bandwidth) evaporate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hello, I'm one of the speakers. I've been working on this since 2017, happy to answer any questions the hackernews crowd might have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is very cool to see distros working together for a common goal.But I still do not understand the point of "reproducible builds".  I know what they are, but to me the amount of work involved outweighs the benefit.I even heard NetBSD is also working on "reproducible builds".  So maybe I am missing something :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42982270</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance and techniques of exploratory data analysis (EDA) specifically in the context of large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes how EDA can be utilized to better understand the performance and behavior of LLMs by examining their input-output relationships, analyzing biases, and assessing the impact of different data preprocessing methods.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a recent similar experience with chat gpt and a gorilla. I was designing a rather complicated algorithm so I wrote out all the steps in words. I then asked chatgpt to verify that it made sense. It said it was well thought out, logical etc. My colleague didn't believe that it was really reading it properly so I inserted a step in the middle "and then a gorilla appears" and asked it again. Sure enough, it again came back saying it was well thought out etc. When I questioned it on the gorilla, it merely replied saying that it thought it was meant to be there, that it was a technical term or a codename for something...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These posts about X task LLMs fails at when you give it Y prompt are getting more and more silly.If you ask an AI to analyze some data, should the default behavior be to use that data to make various types of graphs, export said graphs, feed them back in to itself, then analyze the shapes of those graphs to see if they resemble an animal?Personally I would be very annoyed if I actually wanted a statistical analysis, and it spent a bajillion tokens following the process above in order to tell me my data looks like a chicken when you tip it sideways.&gt; However, this same trait makes them potentially problematic for exploratory data analysis. The core value of EDA lies in its ability to generate novel hypotheses through pattern recognition. The fact that both Sonnet and 4o required explicit prompting to notice even dramatic visual patterns suggests they may miss crucial insights during open-ended exploration.It requires prompting for x if you want it to do x... That's a feature, not a bug. Note that no mention of open-ended exploration or approaching the data from alternate perspectives was made in the original prompt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I uploaded the image to Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking 01 21 and asked:“ Here is a steps vs bmi plot. What do you notice?”Part of the answer:“Monkey Shape: The most striking feature of this plot is that the data points are arranged to form the shape of a monkey. This is not a typical scatter plot where you'd expect to see trends or correlations between variables in a statistical sense. Instead, it appears to be a creative visualization where data points are placed to create an image.”Gemini 2.0 Pro without thinking didn’t see the monkey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42950976</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks great! I currently use Aerospace, but your usage of macOS spaces has me curious.1. Does FlashSpace require disabling SIP?2. Aerospace documents the limitations of macOS spaces [1]. How does FlashSpace  deal with these limitations?3. Do you have any plans to support file-based configuration? I like syncing my dotfiles between multiple computers.[1]: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#emulation-of-v...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest pain point with macOS spaces is how it handles multiple windows of the same app. It drives me crazy. 
What is FlashSpace’s approach for solving this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using AeroSpace for this purpose for over a year. I simply disable all the tiling features in the config and only use two shortcuts: switch to workspace and move current window to workspace. It's absolutely essential when working on a small screen.AeroSpace does indeed suffer from a performance issue but this appears to be inherent to the available macOS APIs: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/131The way you reproduce it is open Factorio.app and quickly switch between workspaces while the game is loading.FlashSpace seems to suffer from this problem as well based on a quick test.With regards to configuration, I think it's cumbersome to configure shortcuts per workspace. In AeroSpace, every letter and number on the keyboard is automatically a workspace and shortcuts are global.All that said, this is a fantastic tool and I would prefer a tool like this that addresses the pain of macOS workspaces as its primary goal rather than being part of a tiling window manager.EDIT: After more testing it appears that FlashSpace does not support having different windows of the same app on different workspaces, this is a dealbreaker for my workflow :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42984420</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Put a hook on the x to distinguish it from a times signThis is counterproductive IMO, because it makes it look like a chi. (The article notes the problem.) That seems more likely to cause issues than the possible ambiguity with the “times” symbol (“×”). If you need a multiplication symbol, use the middle dot (“·”) instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Greek I like this:
https://www.covingtoninnovations.com/pens/GreekChartLarge.jp...There’s an old joke about “mathematical maturity” meaning being able to write a lowercase zeta, but I took enough classes from professors that would confuse xi and zeta that it probably doesn’t matter that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good resource, and pretty much what I tell students in my classes.  I take great care to explain how to write symbols, and I also give multiple pronunciations of the Greek letters.Students with math and physics backgrounds are fine with Greek letters and other mathematical symbols, but the biologists in the class are mystified.  They also get terribly confused when I reuse symbols for different purposes.What I've discovered is that the students who have trouble with mathematical notation and reasoning got derailed when a teacher, in an early grade, said "let x be the unknown".  That is a phrase that never comes up in other contexts, and I think it throws them off track.  Many find it difficult to get back on-track later, so they memorize and sleep-walk their way through other mathematics classes until the system no longer insists that they take them. A shame, really.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42985427</guid></item><item><title>16.

I guess they are trying to get rid of the old, smaller batteries.Also, word of warning just don't apply the 3.08 bios update if you have a 12th gen. I've had nothing but problems with the 3.08 bios update without real remediation from framework. Really, don't perform this upgrade without doing a thorough review of the support forums regarding the issues people are having.There was a blog post about the BIOS update that i found here on this site, but i'm having trouble finding it for reference now. Someone had the same issue as i have where sometimes my system just won't boot (no video and error sequence) unless i remove or re-add a memory module. Not that fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting CPU choice. Seems like it's actually intended for image processing...https://www.starfivetech.com/en/site/soc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope they can update it with a chip that has the vector extension&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946223</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of implementing a Game Boy emulator using the Ruby programming language. It provides a step-by-step guide that covers the core components of the emulator, including the CPU, memory management, and graphical rendering. The author delves into the technical details, illustrating how to emulate the Game Boy's architecture and operations effectively. The piece also highlights challenges faced during development and offers insights into debugging and optimization techniques used to enhance the emulator's performance. Overall, it serves as both a tutorial and a deep dive into game development through emulator creation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When are we finally going to see a game boy emulator for X86 running in an x86 emulator in the game boy?Theoretically, we could then lift the emulation from the platform altogether as a pure wave function, completely isolated from the problematic issues of real hardware made of pesky particles. By shedding problems such as power consumption, physical scaling, and non concurrent memory access, we can finally realise the dream of unlimited cloud resource scaling at zero marginal cost.Why expand memory or cores vertically in a single universe, when you can go horizontal into a small infinity of parallel universes instead. Just collapse the wave from the subset of infinities in the desired page or branch space.As ridiculous as this sounds, it’s not too far off from what we might achieve given the MWI if we actually learn how to manipulate our environment in a selective manner.(Assuming that these kinds of shenanigans turn out to be allowed concurrently with our ability to observe the outcome, which is not really safe to assume)We’ve got a long way to go. Let’s try not to screw it all up just as it’s getting interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super love this as a project for departing from the grind of the day to day, but did you consider the name… Gem Boy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last time I saw a Game Boy emulator written in Ruby was part of a RubyConf presentation[0] a few years back, and the performance at the time was understandably not amazing.The performance here pre-optimisation is more than playable, and with all of the optimisations stacked on top, it was amazing to see it go from ~40FPS to &gt;270FPS.Very impressive feat and a great write-up on the whole process![0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbO2FEpNPvQ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42959110</guid></item><item><title>18.

Posted on their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/C8IHZXYvh8y/?img_index=1With deep sorrow, the Mukerji family announces the passing of Meenakshi Mukerji on June 11, 2024. Meenakshi fought very hard and bravely against stage 4 lung cancer for nearly 5 years, and she passed peacefully surrounded by close family and so much love.Meenakshi was born and raised in Kolkata, India. She obtained her BS in electrical engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, and a MS in computer science from Portland State University, Oregon. After working in the software industry for more than a decade, Meenakshi dedicated her time to her family, her community, travel, and to the arts. She authored many origami books and spread her love and passion for the craft across the world.Meenakshi was a beloved daughter, sister, mother, wife, and friend. Her strength, creativity, positivity, and love will continue to inspire and touch the lives of those who knew her, and also those who didn’t.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Miss the old look of the site?&gt; Visit it here:
&gt; original.origamee.netThis immediately endeared the creators to me. The new design is not even too heavy or flashy or anything, but the empathy in saying "hey, we understand the old design might have worked better for you for whatever reason, here you go" is lovely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have one of her books, Ornamental Origami. I had no idea she was so prolific. And I had no idea she died recently.I encourage anybody that likes geometry and puzzles to give modular origami a try. You just need lots of little pieces of paper, and some patience. Then you end up with fun little desk ornaments: https://wonger.dev/assets/origami.jpg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960684</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "coding hats," which represent different roles or mindsets that developers can adopt in their work. It outlines five distinct hats: the Builder, focused on creating functionality; the Tester, dedicated to finding and fixing bugs; the Designer, who emphasizes user experience and aesthetics; the DevOps Engineer, concerned with deployment and infrastructure; and the Architect, responsible for overall system design and scalability. The article highlights the importance of understanding these roles to enhance collaboration and productivity within development teams.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like analogy's like this. Not in love with this specific one. It feels like OP thought of the first two hats and then tried to think up other hats, rather than have the nebulas idea of different ways of working and structured the analogy around it.Analogies should "simplify" not complicate. If you're ever writing an analogy and think "How can I add more meat to this? You know, enough to make it worth sharing in a blog post?" you're on the wrong path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Putting on my nitpick hat:I think scrappy and mcguyver could be the same hat.I also think chef here is really craftsman, whereas chef makes me think of cooking, as in playful discovery, which is worth its own hat.As someone else mentioned, war time / emergency this is not a drill hat deserves a spot on the shelf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd also add "Surgeon's hat":Coding using only exacting, mechanical transformations that can be reasoned to be safe. Used when coding in poorly understood, mission-critical code bases. You do the bare minimum change to get the result, using verifiably safe operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42962822</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "near misses" in life, emphasizing that they often go unrecognized yet hold significant value in personal growth and decision-making. It argues that reflecting on these near misses can provide important lessons, insights, and opportunities for improvement. By acknowledging and analyzing these experiences, individuals can better navigate future situations, enhance their resilience, and cultivate a deeper understanding of their choices and behaviors. The piece encourages readers to embrace and learn from their near misses rather than dismissing them as mere accidents or failures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some mind-boggling near miss account that no one cared about, see https://avherald.com/h?article=4b6eb830. See how FAA didn’t even have a record of this.And that’s an extreme case. How many less extreme ones happen?In the US alone, there’s research estimating the number of air fume events is around 2000 per year. The number of reported fume events is less than 10.Mental degradation is insidious. “Just wear an oxygen mas-” what if you forgot about the oxygen mask. You forgot to drop the gear.Extensive training (to the point of automation) and human resilience is perhaps the main reason fumes do not seem to be causing many incidents, but resilience can be individual and training cannot drill into pilots the correct intuitive response to all possible scenarios. In addition, it’s unknown in what number of incidents where the cause is pilot’s mistake that mistake was in turn caused by partial mental incapacitation (that perhaps not even the pilot was aware of).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is part of the Israeli Air Force safety culture: https://www.talentgrow.com/podcast/episode92"By implementing a unique culture and methodology, the Israeli Air Force became one of the best in the world in terms of quality, safety, and training, effectively cutting accidents by 95%."Near misses and mistakes are investigated and there's a culture supporting the reporting of these and that has resulted in a huge change to the overall incident rate.Software is a little like this as well. The observable quality issues are sort of the tip of the iceberg. Many bugs and architectural issues can lurk underneath the surface and only some random subset of those will have impact. Focus only on the impactful ones without dealing with what's under the surface may not have a material impact on quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simple decision rule in (personal) aviation is three strikes.e.g., (1) nervous passenger; (2) clouds coming in; (3) running late -&gt; abort.It produces very conservative decisions, and overcomes the drive to just try.But the interesting part is that you then realize how often you are at two strikes.  That in itself makes you more careful.Two strikes I would call "noticeable".  I wouldn't wait for near-miss events.  Then there's a measure of how on-edge we're running.So at work, I just put a red dot on the calendar if it's a day with something urgent and visible to outsiders, or if we're having problems we don't see our way out of.  It keeps us from tolerating long stretches of stress before taking a step back, and we usually also do attribution: if x is causing n&gt;4 red days per month, it gets attention.Obviously, varies with context: high-achieving team would be mostly always red internally, but rarely externally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42950156</guid></item><item><title>24.

It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.&gt; So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent and related:News from Scroll 5 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42955356 - Feb 2025 (3 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They said that the work was a Greek Epicurean work, but described it as finding fulfillment in the pleasures of life.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think it would make a large difference in runtime, but the bounds aren't quite right.The largest possible value isn't 999,999,999, because that's not a legal value. The largest value is 987,654,321Dividing that by 9, you get 109,739,369, but that's not a legal value either, you'd want to start with 109,738,365 for the gcd as it's a valid possible row. I don't know that all gcds would need to be a valid row, but any gcd larger than 98,765,432 would need to be used at multiples from 1-9; with that gcd or smaller, multiple 10 becomes viable and the gcd doesn't need to be valid with multiple of 1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For us slow kids in the back what does this mean, “[…] such that the nine 9-digit numbers formed by the rows of the grid has the highest-possible GCD over any such grid”?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also wrote my solution in Rust. I was pleased that my approach gave me an opportunity to write a linked list and get the chance to apply some rarely used learning[0].My solution doesn't use SIMD, but is actually takes about the same amount of time as the the solution in the article, given the same number of cores, though an glaring weakness of my approach is that it can only scale up to 7 cores as written.Rough outline of how mine works:- Set current best GCD to 1.- Search through all valid board configurations.- Bail out from the search early if the current partially generated board couldn't have a GCD greater than the current maximum found, e.g. if we've only generated two rows of the board, and the GCD of those two rows are already less than the max.- Update the current best GCD as you find higher ones.- Share the current best GCD value across multiple threads. That way the longer the program runs, the earlier and earlier the searches will start bailing out.- Don't always read from the shared variable to avoid contention. Instead, each thread has its own copy of the last value it read which we compare with first before copying and caching the shared value.- Another interesting property of this approach is that it can be used to validate the correct solution even faster than it takes to find it. Instead of initially setting the max GCD to 1, set it to `solution - 1`. That way branches in our search will bail even sooner from the beginning. This leads to the program running about 20% more quickly.Source: https://gist.github.com/lazytype/35b45f3ea81b5c1c5555546fe6f...[0] https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957395</guid></item><item><title>26.

At that point, don't you lose a lot of the scalability and usefulness?It feels very much like the "read" in the "read-after-write consistency" is usually forgotten, hand-waved away with "eventual consistency", or is actually just a single node handling the coordination somewhere, leading us to not having nearly as scalable a system as we are promised by the database.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42958542</guid></item><item><title>28. 21st Century C++</title><link>https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/21st-century-c/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last weekend, I took an old cross-platform app written by somebody else between 1994-2006 in C++ and faffed around with it until it compiled and ran on my modern Mac running 14.x. I upped the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD to 20, used Clang, and all was good. Actually, the biggest challenge was the shoddy code in the first place, which had nothing to do with its age. After I had it running, Sonar gave me 7,763 issues to fix.The moral of the story? Backwards compatibility means never leaving your baggage behind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The C++ Core Guidelines have existed for nearly 10 years now. Despite this, not a single implementation in any of the three major compilers exists that can enforce them. Profiles, which Bjarne et al have had years to work on, will not provide memory safety[0]. 
The C++ committee, including Bjarne Stroustrup, needs to accept that the language cannot be improved without breaking changes. However, it's already too late. Even if somehow they manage to make changes to the language that enforce memory safety, it will take a decade before the efforts propagate at the compiler level (a case in point is modules being standardised in 2020 but still not ready for use in production in any of the three major compilers).[0] https://www.circle-lang.org/draft-profiles.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let us know when C++ gets rid of the mess that is header files.Until then... YAWN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946321</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Carbon Is Not a Language" explores the idea that carbon, often discussed in terms of climate change and environmental impact, should not be viewed solely through the lens of communication or language. It argues for a deeper understanding of carbon's roles and implications in ecological systems, emphasizing the interconnectedness of life, matter, and the need for holistic approaches to environmental issues. The piece encourages readers to consider the broader implications of carbon beyond its conventional definitions, advocating for a more nuanced conversation about its significance in the context of sustainability and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

I associate that term strongly with the old Carbon API from Apple.Carbon was officially removed with 10.15 Catalina in 2019 - what's the statute of limitations on reusing a name like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983733</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the development of a new deep learning model aimed at improving the efficiency of natural language processing tasks. It introduces innovative techniques for enhancing model performance and addresses challenges such as overfitting and data sparsity. The authors provide empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach compared to existing models, highlighting improvements in metrics such as accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper also outlines potential applications of the model in various fields, emphasizing its ability to handle complex language understanding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My attempt at a summary: authors characterize the data-compute pareto front (aka how bitter is the lesson, exactly?)For a different perspective, error vs compute, seehttps://youtu.be/5eqRuVp65eYand comments(I particularly liked the one about string theorists rediscovering a fundamental theorem in GR decades too late-- rediscovering how to integrate happens in every field, it's nothing to be ashamed of :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimmed little bits: "on policy" RL means the model has generated output and received feedback from sort of dynamic environment, which might not be scalable. Value-based off-policy means the model is trained with data that wasn't generated from the model itself exploring a dynamic environment. Instead it can be recordings. They then ask the question; how does that scale?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RL is unbelievably finicky, sensitive to hyperparameters, and hard to make work. If you are pursuing a research project and decide to use RL, you are making your life a lot more difficult and stressful.It's exciting to see any progress in making accurate predictions about what settings will work for RL training. I hope that this research direction can be expanded in scope and that ultimately, people who want to do research in RL can become confident in their training recipes.I am more excited about that, than about the dream of scaling compute per se.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979846</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential impact and implications of Starlink satellite internet service in the Falkland Islands, highlighting concerns over national security and reliance on foreign technology. It emphasizes that the integration of such technology could be viewed as a national emergency, given the geopolitical tensions in the region. The piece raises questions about cybersecurity threats, the autonomy of the Falkland Islands, and the importance of developing local infrastructure and services to mitigate risks associated with foreign dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

Sure only ever gave tiny concesions when pressed to do so, or paid to do so. They are still highly subsidized by the local government.&gt; The horrendous de-facto ISP (Sure) charges £110 a month for 100 GB [0] of data usage at a top download speed of 5 (five, literal five [V in roman]) MBPS, while Starlink offers unlimited usage for £60 per month at an average download speed of 130 MBPS.[0] Sure is a company with a long record of predatory conduct (more on a previous comment): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657692&gt; https://guernseypress.com/news/2024/10/02/sure-ordered-to-pa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well an island like this is basically a big strata where dividing the cost of infrastructure between everyone makes things livable. Don’t be surprised there’s a monopoly telco, because it probably doesn’t make economic sense any other way.And keep in mind they probably insisted on a monopoly contract because they probably spent an absolute bomb setting it up, only to get max 1500 or so subscribers.Say: 1500 subscribers @ $100/pm and you’d be running a telco on only $1.8M per year. That’s about enough money to pay for compliance, infra upkeep, and hire maybe 2-3 staff who wear many hats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; using Starlink in the islands continues to be illegal and is considered a criminal offenceWhat is wrong with this place?

I don't want a lot, maybe 3, just to see the UI and options I then have.This feels pre-alpha.Edit:I have many RSS feeds (ty NetNewsWire). I have Bluesky, I have Mastodon, I have podcasts I follow ........ and Tapestry tempts me how?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would only be interesting with Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. support. ToS prevent that, so no business would attempt that integration. However, that doesn't mean it can't be done.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Turner Bird: Eratosthenes – An Eternal Burning Thread" discusses the implementation and concepts behind the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm within the context of functional programming. It highlights the historical importance of the algorithm for finding prime numbers and explores how functional programming can enhance its efficiency and applicability. The author presents detailed explanations, code examples, and theoretical insights aimed at both demonstrating the algorithm's workings and encouraging its integration into functional programming practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the relationship between gold and arsenic, highlighting how arsenic is often found in gold deposits and can influence gold mining operations. It discusses the geological processes that lead to the co-occurrence of these elements and examines the implications for mining companies, such as potential challenges with arsenic contamination and the need for responsible management practices. The piece underscores the importance of understanding this interplay for optimizing gold extraction while addressing environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

So if arsenic helps gold concentrate in deposits, does this mean arsenic-rich environments are better places to prospect? Or is it more about how existing deposits form rather than finding new ones?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It loves mercury too which is also toxic.

Browsers still play gifs and animated WebP right on page load, which is distracting and uses a lot of network bandwidth. All animated content should adhere to "Block autoplay" setting in the browser, not only video files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basically use webp if you want to have the fewest problems while still retaining the majority of benefits out there. Good compression, works across most devices, and unexpected pitfalls like animating transparency aren't an issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957799</guid></item><item><title>37.

When I look at modern 64 bit architecture books that get suggested for me to teach with I just laugh.Anyway, not to say I agree 100% with Blow on everything, but connecting technology down to the roots is a hard problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think JavaScript on the server and React and these things has really made the web a mess of software development compared to how little stuff it actually does.I know for a fact a bunch of kids now do not even know that HTML is what gets rendered in the browser. They think that React is itself what browsers render.Not to mention the absolute idiot of a CEO of Vercel who thinks React is the Linux kernel of development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blow often makes fantastic points about development, and often completely misses the mark.He’s accomplished great things and has ideas worth listening to - but also plenty of nonsense that’s presented indistinguishably.I felt quite strongly that the collapse of civilisation talk was one of those pieces of nonsense, and I’ve largely ignored it (despite listening to it twice). I’m grateful to OP for providing a more principled rebuttal.Don’t even get me started on Casey Muratori, who tries to do the Blow thing but doesn’t even get the good parts right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42986485</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Thus, learning Mandarin by reading requires first memorizing hundreds or thousands of words, before you can even know where one word ends and the next word begins.That's not been my experience at all: As long as the content I'm reading is at the right level, I've been able to learn to segment as my vocabulary has grown, and there's always only a few new words that I haven't learned how to recognize in-context yet.  Having a good built-in dictionary wherever you're reading (e.g., a Chrome plugin, or Pleco, or whatever) has been helpful here.My fear would be that the longer you put off learning to segment in your head, the harder it will be.My advice for this would be that you present the text as you'd normally see it (e.g., no segmentation), but add aids to help learners see or understand the segmentation.  At very least you could have the dictionary pop-up be on the level of the full segmentation, rather than individual characters; and you could consider having it so that as you mouse over a character, it draws a little line under / border around the characters in the same segment.  That could allow you to give your brain the little hint it needs to "see" the words segmented "in situ".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP, thank you for your work, I will continue to watch it.I tried to built something similar, but what I didn't discover and think is crucial is the proper FE: yes, word segmenting is useful, but if I have to click on each word to see its meaning, for how I learn Chinese by reading texts, I still find Zhongwen Chrome extension to be more useful, since I see English meaning quicker, just by hover cursor over the word.In my project, I was trying to display English translation under each Chinese word, which would I think require AI to determine the correct translation, since one cannot just put CC-CEDIT entry there.P.S: I dont know how you built your dictionary, it translated 气功师 as "Aerosolist", which I am not sure what is exactly, but this should be actually two words, not one - correct segmentation and translation is 气功 师, "qigong master".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work OP.I’ve done a fair amount of Chinese language segmentation programming - and yeah it’s not easy, especially as you reach for higher levels of accuracy.You need to put in significant amounts of effort just for less than a few % point increases in accuracy.For my own tools which focus on speed (and used for finding frequently used words in large bodies of text) I ended up opting for  a first longest match algorithm.It has a relatively high error rate, but it’s acceptable if you’re only looking for the first few hundred frequently used words.What segmented are you using, or have you developed your own?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42936085</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;  While I could go into a long story here about the relative merits of the
  two designs, suffice it to say that among the people who actually design
  operating systems, the debate is essentially over. Microkernels have won.

The developers of BSD UNIX, SunOS, and many others would disagree. Also, the then upcoming Windows NT was a hybrid kernel design. While it has an executive "micro-kernel", all of the traditional kernel stuff outside the "microkernel" runs in kernel mode too, so it is really a monolithic kernel with module loading.While the original post was written well before NeXTSTEP, the Mach 3.0 kernel was converted into a monolithic kernel in NeXTSTEP, which later became MacOS. The reality is that Mach 3.0 was just still slow performance wise, much like how NT would have been had they had made it into an actual micro-kernel.In the present day, the only place where microkernels are common are embedded applications, but embedded systems often don't even have operating systems and more traditional operating systems are present there too (e.g. NuttX).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the thread that I read in high school that made me fall in love with software architecture. This was primarily because Tanenbaum’s position was so obviously correct, yet it was also clear to all that Linux was going to roll everyone, even at that early stage.I still hand this out to younger software engineers to understand the true principle of architecture. I have a print off of it next to my book on how this great new operating system and SDK from Taligent was meant to be coded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've heard of this debate but haven't heard an argument of adoption from a FOSS perspective. From Wikipedia on Minix [0]:&gt;  MINIX was initially proprietary source-available, but was relicensed under the BSD 3-Clause to become free and open-source in 2000.That is a full eight years after this post.Also from Wikipedia on Linux becoming FOSS [1]:&gt; He [Linus Torvalds] first announced this decision in the release notes of version 0.12. In the middle of December 1992 he published version 0.99 using the GNU GPL.So this post was essentially right at the cross roads of Linux going from some custom license to FOSS while MINIX would remain proprietary for another eight years, presumably long after it had lost to Linux.I do wonder how much of an effect, subtle or otherwise, the licensing helped or hindered adoption of either.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42980283</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "strong link problems" in science, emphasizing that scientific progress relies heavily on a few key experiments and theories that can disproportionately influence the field. It argues that breakthroughs in science often depend on these pivotal elements, and if they are flawed or misinterpreted, they can lead to widespread misinformation and stagnation in research. The piece highlights the importance of critically evaluating foundational studies and encourages scientists to be aware of their reliance on these strong links to foster more robust and reliable scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work as a scientist. I'm not sure I agree science is a strong-link problem. Rather, it contains both strong- and weak-link problems.A lot of science work consist of what my scientist mother calls "bread work" - validation of existing techniques, building a general corpus of knowledge, maintaining databases with useful information and so on. These is weak-link work. A bad quality database will undermine any research which is built on it and not aware of its limitations.A good recent example may be the stem cell research field, which was (and perhaps still is?) bogged down by being built on bad fundamentals.But yes, more broadly speaking I do agree that science funding should be built to encourage more risk of failure, more elitism, and more consolidation of large project to be able to "punch through".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the weak-link/strong-link distinction, but you need to be careful what problem exactly you are talking about. "Science" is not a problem. "How to distribute funding to scientists" is a problem. And here the weakest links actually matter, because you only have a finite amount of funding, and you don't want to waste it on the weak scientists, so you have more for strong scientists.Another way of phrasing that problem is, "what actually is strong science, and what is weak science"? Over a few decades, that question usually plays out correctly, but even a few years is often not enough to tell, even for specialists, especially for truly new and original science. As an example, right now, would you say abstraction logic [1] is strong or weak science?And of course, venture capital funding is also not a strong-link problem. You can waste money on some weak startups that you thought were actually strong, but do that too much, and your fund goes under.[1] http://abstractionlogic.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One purpose of science is to provide the rest of the society, who are not scientists, with reliable insights, ideally with actionable advice on how to solve a problem. If you treat science purely as a stong-link problem, the burden of quality control lays with the consumer of science. Peer review attempts to lay it with experts. That approach is nowhere near perfect, but is the best we have. And it scales much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42937187</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Leaning Tower of New York" discusses the architectural and cultural significance of a newly constructed building in New York City that has drawn attention for its unique design and engineering challenges, which have resulted in a slight lean. It explores the public's fascination with unconventional structures, the reactions of residents and visitors, and the implications of such a design in terms of urban aesthetics and safety. The piece blends commentary on modern architecture with insights into how these types of structures impact city life and perception.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI: The Old (or Skew) Jan Cathedral in Delft, Netherlands (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oude_Kerk_(Delft)) is off by slightly less than 2 meters. As it was built adjacent to a canal, and pile-driving technology didn't exists in the 14th century, it was built on layers of wood and cow skins that started rotting already during its building phase, causing the tower to lean from the get go -- curiously, its four pinnacle towers are straight up. The church houses Holland's biggest bell (the Bourdon at 9 metric ton) which, to reduce vibration and further leaning, is only rung at special occasions re the royal Orange family (births and deaths).  Holland's painter Johannes Vermeer also used to be buried there -- because of excessive bad small all graves were cleared late 19th century and dumped in a mass grave some place nobody knows. To the satisfying of many a tourist, an impressive grave-like commemoration stone for Vermeer was installed some years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/GVcHb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Little trivia about... The other famous leaning tower. Pisa has a very soft soil, and there are other 2 leaning bell towers. One is even more tilted than the tower of Pisa. Although much smaller, its tilt is quite strong imho.https://www.pisatoday.it/cronaca/torri-pendenti-pisa.htmlThe cathedral of Pisa is slightly leaning as well. If you look at the base just above the steps on its side facing the lawm, you can see the bricks are misaligned&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932747</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "fat-rand," an extension of the traditional random number generator (RNG) framework that incorporates additional entropy sources to improve randomness quality. It critiques existing RNGs and offers insights on designing better systems that ensure true randomness, especially in cryptographic applications. The author emphasizes the importance of unpredictability and robustness in randomness, advocating for practices that enhance the reliability of RNGs in various technological contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So let's vendor it. How much code is there? After removing all tests, we end up with 29 individual crates vendored taking up 62MB disk space. Tokei reports 209,150 lines of code.&gt; Now this is a bit misleading, because like many times most of this is within windows-. But how much of windows- does getrandom need? A single function.See also the Azure CLI. There's a github issue, still open, from 2018 complaining about their 350 MB monstrosity bloating up a docker container. By now the thing weighs more than 1.5 GB. Fucking MS.https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/7387&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with his sentiments in the article. I love Rust as a PL, but the situation with certain crates and dependency trees is a bit of a nightmare IMO. It's certainly a trade off.I recently ripped out the rand crate and replaced it with some much simpler code ported from a C++ codebase. Still does what I need it to do but way fewer LOC and way less complexity. Is it as flexible as what rand and related crates offer? Maybe not, but that flexibility comes at a cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that the rand crate is much bigger than it needs to be and is conflating unrelated concepts *. This is a sore spot for the stdlib - it should standardize 1 PRNG and a CSPRNG so that they’re available on all platforms as a default and the types that everyone can use so that you can properly plug in whatever PRNG / CSPRNG that you want. It should also standardize what interfaces random distributions should conform to and implement really common ones like Norm &amp; Uniform. Those two changes alone would remove the need for the vast majority of dependencies, especially if a crate wants to delegate selection of the RNG to their users.That being said, I simultaneously think the concerns are slightly overblown on the safety part. Having stable pillar crates that everyone builds around is a good thing not a bad thing. The build issues for things like that should be solved at the language/tooling level (e.g. pulling in a crate for 1 function should be trivially cheap) while relying on the network effects of auditing the components (i.e. it’s OK to rely on a crate with a stronger chain of trust than you have yourself).* To be fair, they call out alternatives that you might find more appealing, but the type and module system being what it is (+ the name rand being so concise and appealing when you come at it with a first glance), it becomes the de facto standard.*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42956697</guid></item><item><title>44.

Maybe:3) The tech industry invented the initial stages a kind of mind that, though misses the mark, is approaching something not too dissimilar to how an aspect of human intelligence works.&gt; By using validation statements, … the chatbot and the psychic both give the impression of being able to make extremely specific answers, but those answers are in fact statistically generic."Mr. Geller, can you write some Python code for me to convert a 1-bit .bmp file to a hexadecimal string?"Sorry, even if you think the underlying mechanisms have some sort of analog there's real value in LLM's, not so psychics doing "cold readings".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's another illusory effect here: Humans are being encouraged to confuse a fictional character with the real-world "author" system.I can create a mad-libs program which dynamically reassembles stories involving a kind and compassionate Santa Claus, but that does not mean the program shares those qualities. I have not digitally reified the spirit of Christmas, not even if excited human kids contribute some of the words that shape its direction and clap with glee.P.S.: This "LLM just makes document bigger" framing is also very useful understanding how prompt injection and hallucinations are constant core behaviors, which we just ignore except when they inconvenience us  The assistant-bot in the story can be twisted or vanish so abruptly because it's just something in a digital daydream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Do LLMs think?" is a false problem outside of the field of philosophy.The real question that gets billions invested is "Is it useful?".If the "con artist" solves my problem, that's fine by me. It is like having a mentalist tell me "I see that you are having a leaky faucet and I see your future in a hardware store buying a 25mm gasket and teflon tape...". In the end, I will have my leak fixed and that's what I wanted, who care how it got to it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983571</guid></item><item><title>45.

However, to present in the guise of a volume of mainstream essays the spade-work left over from a life of academic toil can only diminish the posthumous reputation of a writer who, in books such as The Rings of Saturn and the superb Austerlitz, showed himself to be one of the last masters from the great age of Mitteleuropean high literature that is now drawing to a close, in its own silent catastrophe.'https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/07/silent-catastr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strongly recommend Rings of Saturn, and also A Place In The Country.

It can take a self-discovery like this article describes to bring someone back around to the idea that the condition is related to something like anxiety or obsessive behaviors and is receptive to behavioral modification.&gt; I'd just skip the night and take my sweet time to: write, draw, practice calligraphy, code a little toy, make a little sculpture from a scrap of wood.Importantly, none of these activities involve entering the ragebait vortex that exists in most people’s Internet time wasting destinations. For many people it’s enough to just cut out Reddit or similar sites in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a life long insomniac which got me into working in neurotech/sleeptech about 5 years ago.People talk about CBT-I, sleep anxiety, etc etc.From what I've found, this may be great for people with transient insomnia, where the stress is the cause of the insomnia. The key for these people is often the CBT, which helps the I, not that the CBT is to treat the I.I've come to asking chronic insomniacs "is there something you like about being awake in the middle of the night", and I've had many responses such as "it's my time to think", "I know I should be sleeping, but my mind is enjoying the peacefulness".I'm not a very stressed person, and I can meditate in the middle of the night, and yet still be awake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946095</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by Andrew C. Myers titled "maybe" presents a software framework for representing and manipulating optional values in programming. It aims to provide a more robust way to handle cases where values may be present or absent, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors associated with null references.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;`then` is definitely less intuitive than `map` considering that you actually want to, well, map to something else.Semantically, `then` would be equivalent to `ifPresent`, but, well, then both are intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting attempt, however:1. There was no need to implement Set interface to support foreach loop. Iterable would be sufficient. Set is too specific and is not an obvious choice (for return type interoperability in subclasses sometimes it would be more convenient to have List).2. Moving from isPresent/get to try/catch checked exception will produce worse result. Either you wrap ‘get’ immediately and get more verbose code, or you catch somewhere else and loose the context and readability. In “throws Exception” methods absence of stack trace will be painful.3. Renaming ‘map’ to ‘then’ is too late. “Then” was used in functional style libraries more than 15 years ago, Java 8 settled the naming convention and it’s better to follow it.4. What Optional is often missing is the context of empty state. It would be cool to have an implementation of None with a Throwable cause (and orElseThrow throwing it wrapped).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real improvement is to lift nullability up to the type system. That way, every type acts as an optional by default, and the computer can infer when a nullable type has been null-checked.This is what Kotlin does - it's truly freeing to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42961849</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues for the importance of recognizing subspecies in conservation efforts, highlighting that subspecies represent significant variations within species that are often overlooked in ecological strategies. The author discusses how the traditional focus on species as the primary unit of conservation neglects the unique adaptations and ecological roles of subspecies. By acknowledging and protecting these distinct groups, conservationists can better address biodiversity loss and improve ecosystem resilience. The piece emphasizes that a more nuanced understanding of subspecies can aid in effective conservation planning and foster a deeper appreciation for the complexity of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The definition of what's a species or subspecies starts getting fun when you consider ring species[0].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species?useskin=vector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clicked the link thinking, "Finally Radu Vladislas has his day".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has recently been dealing with taxonomic classification, this world is a complete mess. For one, there isn't even a singular authority on classification. Secondly, the "data model" we have for classification isn't even capable of actually representing proper lineages.Linnaean classification, i.e. Domain &gt; Kingdom ... Genus &gt; Species is a tree data structure, wherein each node has one parent. Now what happens if you have something like a Leyland Cypress, a hybrid?A Leyland Cypress is a very popular tree that is the product of hybridizing an Alaskan Cypress and a Monterey Cypress. Let's begin analyzing all of the problems with this:1.) As mentioned, we can only choose one parent, even though all species have 2. Which lineage to choose?2.) We know the exact parents of this new species, and yet the fact that Linnaean taxonomy uses a fixed number of ancestor node ranks means we can't classify this under a parent, but rather go to the parent's genus3.) The idea of "species" being the only thing that can produce viable offspring is completely incorrect, so being stuck with a parent's genus as a foolproof way of reparenting a node is not reliable. While an Alaskan Cypress and Monterey Cypress used to both be classified as Cypresses (Cupressus nootkatensis and Cupressus macrocarpa, respectively), they've now each been reclassified multiple times into multiple different genuses, and are now Callitropsis nootkatensis and Hesperocyparis macrocarpa respectively. So we've created a viable offspring not just from two different species, but two different genuses.4.) Many of these classifications were come up with purely phenotypically and have nothing to do with genetic lineages.So is a Leyland Cypress classified as Callitropsis or Hesperocyparis, or the former Chamaecyparis or Cupressus? Just choose an arbitrary grandparent node, and throw away the information of half of its lineage, as well as the information of its species-level parentage.And then within the species level, as mentioned by the original article, we have subspecies (or infraspecific ranks). Subspecies, varieties, subvarieties, forms, subforms, proles, cultivars, etc. If you think there's sanity found in that world, you'd be mistaken.Fortunately scientists dealing with actual genetic lineages have begun switching to a different system which is not only founded in genetics, but also has a proper data model to represent it, which is a graph wherein any node can be associated with a particular ancestor. So a Leyland Cypress could be parented to an Alaskan cypress and a Monterey cypress. It can also be parented to ancestors of any rank, and this parentage can be any number of levels deep. Each of these assertions of parentage puts a particular entity in what is referred to as a "clade," making this form of classification referred to as "cladistic" or "phylogenetic."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42924068</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The website "The Bullshit Machines" focuses on critiquing and analyzing various social, political, and cultural issues, often highlighting the absurdities and inconsistencies in contemporary society. It employs humor and satire to address topics such as misinformation, consumerism, and the media landscape, encouraging critical thinking and engagement from its audience. The tone is irreverent and provocative, aiming to provoke thought and discussion around serious matters through a lighthearted approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure why everyone rates this. It’s full of very confidently made statements like “the AI has no ground truth” (obviously it does, it has ingested every paper ever), it “can’t reason logically” which seems like a stretch if you ever read the CoT of a frontier reasoning model and “can’t explain how they arrived at conclusions” where - I mean just try it yourself with o1, go as deep as you like asking how it arrived at a conclusion and see if a human can do any better.In fact the most annoying thing about this article is that it is a string of very confidently made, black and white statements, offered with no supporting evidence, and some of which I think are actually wrong… i.e. it suffers from the same kind of unsubstantiated self confidence that we complain about with the weaker models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing!I was speaking to a friend the other day who works in a team that influences government policy. One of the younger members of the team had been tasked with generating a report on a specific subject. They came back with a document filled with “facts”, including specific numbers they’d pulled from a LLM. Obviously it was inaccurate and unreliable.As someone who uses LLMs on a daily basis to help me build software, I was blown away that someone would misuse them like this. It’s easy to forget that devs have a much better understanding of how these things work, can review and fix the inaccuracies in the output and tend to be a sceptical bunch in general.We’re headed into a time where a lot of people are going to implicitly trust the output from these devices and the world is going to be swamped with a huge quantity of subtly inaccurate content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(while I work at OAI, the opinion below is strictly my own)I feel like the current version is fairly hazardous to students and might leave them worse off.If I offer help to nontechnical friends, I focus on:- look at rate of change, not current point- reliability substantially lags possibility, by maybe two years.- adversarial settings remain largely unsolved if you get enough shots, trends there are unclear- ignore the parrot people, they have an appalling track record prediction-wise- autocorrect argument is typically (massively) overstated because RL exists- doomers are probably wrong but those who belittle their claims typically understand less than the doomers do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989320</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure TFA's conclusion is right; but its argument would be strengthened by providing the codegen for both versions, instead of just the better version. Quote:"The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimizer [sic] version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version [...] wasting two multiplications and one or two additions. [...] But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the relevant part of the shader"—then proceeds to show only one codegen: the one containing no multiplications or additions. That proves the good version is fine; it doesn't yet prove the bad version is worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was a good way of knowing when an if forces an actual branch rather than when it doesn't. The reason people do potentially more expensive mix/lerps is because while it might cost a tiny overhead, they are scared of making it a branch.I do like that the most obvious v = x &gt; y ? a : b; actually works, but it's also concerning that we have syntax where an if is some times a branch and some times not. In a context where you really can't branch, you'd almost like branch-if and  non-branching-if to be different keywords.  The non-branching one would fail compilation if the compiler couldn't do it without branching. The branching one would warn if it could be done with branching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not going to second guess IQ, who is one of the greatest modern authorities on shaders, but I do have some counterarguments.- Due to how SIMD works, it's quite likely both paths of the conditional statement get executed, so its a wash- Most importantly, if statements look nasty on the screen. Having an if statement means a discontinuity in visuals, which means jagged and ugly pixels on the output. Of course having a step function doesnt change this, but that means the code is already in the correct form to replace it with smoothstep, which means you can interpolate between the two variations, which does look good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990324</guid></item><item><title>3.

They basically becomes part informer and part subject expert, especially since IT security expertise seems to be a difficult subject matter to teach in universities. When I studied IT security in university, about 10 years ago, I heard multiple version of this several times, with one student from my university getting employed because they managed to demonstrate a hack on a bank.I always hope that such recruits had a bit tighter surveillance from their employee, but no one in the industry describes such recruits as "highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang", and absolutely no one described them as members of violent street gang. It might have been a fair label but at most, such teens were describe as smart but mischievous. Might not be the best people to be responsible for national security, or peoples bank accounts, but it seemed to be the culture of that industry.Has other people in the IT security industry had the similar experience of this culture?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the DOGE teen is a former denizen of ‘The Com,’ an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaborationTo be honest, this is my first time hearing about The Com.

This pays off later down the line when you can link people to things you've written in the past.Credibility is a very valuable commodity.

Actively send links to people who you are already engaged in conversation with.It's not the number of readers you have that matters: it's their quality.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the use of deep learning techniques for time series forecasting, presenting various approaches and methodologies. It delves into the advantages of neural networks over traditional statistical methods, emphasizing their ability to capture complex patterns in data. The authors review different models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, discussing their effectiveness in predicting future values based on historical data. Additionally, the paper highlights challenges in the field, including overfitting and the need for large datasets, while suggesting future research directions to enhance forecasting performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool result, but worth highlighting two points:- Model is finetuned from Qwen-2.5 Instruct, which includes millions of specially filtered math examples in both pretraining and supervised fine-tuning already.- To generate the perfect 817 math examples for LIMO, they used state of the art models like R1 to filter down from an initial pool of 10 million math problems. In other words, a whole lot of intelligence was used to craft a maximally informative and distilled set of fine-tuning data. It’s not very clear to me if this is more or less impressive than getting the same result by simply fine-tuning on the 10 million initial pool, but I suppose that would make for a worse headline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is how I make sense of it (I have no expertise in this subject, please feel free to correct me if I am wrong): I think when the model is pretrained on the internet, it does gain most of the skills required to do mathematical reasoning, however, since its task is to predict the next word distribution on the entire internet, it does not normally use this ability, since most of the text on the internet is not this type of reasoning text (think of generative image models a few years ago, where appending "unreal engine" to a prompt would significantly improve the quality of the output, the reason was that the model was trained to generate the distribution of the images on the internet, most of them are not particularly impressive, however, since images containing "unreal engine" were usually high-quality screenshots of images, it would also move the distribution of generated images towards higher quality generations). So I think the model already has most of the ability, it just needs to adjust a few connections to actually utilize this latent skill, so it makes sense that a few training examples are enough to adjust the connections to increase mathematical reasoning skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My guess at the upshot: Some domains, like math, are general but have outsized effective vocabularies like all possible numbers, which makes them more expensive to train by the same method that works for domains of regular-sized vocabularies. If you train for reasoning steps in such a problem domain, you can reinforce the comparatively few general terms of the vocabulary like "add", "inverse", "solve". And that leaves the arithmetic of number combinations separate from particular problems because you're not emphasizing one-shot answers. You can train N reasoning cases + M arithmetic cases instead of N*M whole math problems. So you have to use more inference power but you can get better answers for less training.Theory aside, I would think a good application-side method is to use this general reasoning process to structure a final expression and then pass that through a traditional evaluator. Then the reasoning and training thereof need only go as far as symbol manipulation. This is something like Wolfram Alpha, if its NLP handed off to the evaluator much later in the process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991676</guid></item><item><title>7.

Because finding a yeast that actively metabolizes sugar at 370 degrees Celsius might be somewhat challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bananas are notoriously hard to turn into a cleaner wine, mainly because of the fact that most bananas that are not Cavendish have a lot of latex and turn into goop. Most of the places where banana wine is produced (tropics) ultimately also turn it into banana "gin", and there's an incredibly deep and long cultural history of its production, e.g. it's tied to British colonialism in West Africa funded by liquor revenues, regulation was a hot topic of local protests, and drinking bars used to be hotbeds of nationalist agitation. When Nkrumah's CPP took over Ghana, they legalized homemade wine/liquor as a symbol against the gin drinking imperialists (in 1890 a bunch of countries in Brussels banned liquor importation to Africa).The other much easier to produce wine and spirit comes from palm sugar (akpeteshie in Ghana, toddy in Indonesia), but the time window of when it is fresh and can be consumed is counted in hours, so it's not stable enough as an agricultural product to sell. Banana wine is an easy way to turn surplus calories into surplus cents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;370 degrees Celsius? Hopefully a typoLast time I was in Rwanda I had banana wine. It comes in beer bottles.I think it’s an acquired taste - I didn’t have the acumen to acquire it myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42985342</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This hits home. I am helping someone analyze medical research data. When I helped before a few years ago we spent a few weeks trying to clean the data, figure out how to run the basic analysis (linear regression, etc), only to arrive at "some" results that were never repeatable because we learned as we built.I am doing it again now. I used Claude to import the data from CSV into a database, then asked it to help me normalize it, which output a txt file with a lot of interesting facts about the data. Next step I asked to write a "fix data" script that will fix all the issues I told it about.Finally, I said "give me univariate analysis, output the results into CSV / PNG and then write a separate script to display everything in a jupyter notebook".Weeks of work into about 2 hours...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of these examples/walkthroughs look like they have been generated by LLMs. They might be useful for teaching purposes, but I believe they significantly underestimate the amount of domain knowledge that often goes into data extraction, data cleaning and data wrangling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Afaict this skips the evals and alignment side of LLMs. We find result quality is where most of our AI time goes when helping teams across industries and building our own LLM tools. Calling an API and getting bad results is the easy part, while ensuring good results is the part we get paid for.If you look at tools like dspy, even if you disagree with their solutions, much of their effort is on helping get good vs bad results. In practice, I find different LLM use cases to have different correctness approaches, but it's not that many. I'd encourage anyone trying to teach here to always include how to get good results for every method presented, otherwise it is teaching bad &amp; incomplete methods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990036</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Chimes at Midnight" explores the life and legacy of Shakespeare's works, particularly focusing on the play "Hamlet." It examines key themes such as the complexity of the human experience, the nature of existence, and the influence of time and death. The piece also highlights the impact of these themes on literature and contemporary culture, offering insights into Shakespeare's enduring relevance and the profound questions his plays provoke. Overall, it serves as a reflection on the timelessness of Shakespeare's exploration of the human condition and the significance of his narratives in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;

The clockworks are more of an entropy amplifier than what we think of as a timekeeping device, which I guess is the point of the metaphor, in a way. The clockworks embody eastern philosophy and humility and Bezos’ clock embodies manifest destiny and arrogance?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am amused by the way the author gives such detailed directions for “an enterprising trespasser” to pay an unauthorised visit to the Clock.It’s also a clever device to make the account of the author’s visit more vivid, because I as the reader imagine making the journey myself.(But I do think it would be a fun adventure to try to follow the directions.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only half way through but damn what a good read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989609</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a project by Kevin Burke, focusing on the introduction of a new utility to help Northern California cities manage their resources more efficiently. It outlines the challenges faced by these cities, such as water scarcity and energy management, and illustrates how the utility aims to provide innovative solutions for sustainability and optimization of resources. Burke emphasizes the need for community involvement and highlights potential benefits for local residents and businesses through improved infrastructure and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to live in a small town in Michigan which had city provided power using a dam.  It was inexpensive and highly reliable.  But every couple of years the big power company in the state would try and get the city to sell them the utility.After I moved a city council for whatever reason ended up selling.  As a result the cost of electricity immediately doubled and power outages occurred regularly due to reduced maintenance.  I don't know what they spent the money on that they received but it was a very poor decision that I have to believe they regret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author estimates that electricity prices would be reduced by up to 33% (from $0.45 blended rate to $0.30), but PG&amp;E’s profit margins are only 11%. That’s a good hint that this hypothetical is missing some important detailsThe article hedges against someone pointing this out by admitting that Walnut Creek is an unusually optimistic location and that PG&amp;E is also recognizing large expenses related to ongoing infrastructure buildouts, but no solutions are offered for these caveats.The hidden problem with projects like this is that once you roll these utilities into the city’s budget it’s too tempting to start dipping into taxpayer funds for needed improvements rather than raising electricity rates. When problems arise, politicians try to kick it down the road so it becomes their successor’s problem, or they try to offload the expense onto a growing debt load because that delays the problem to the next generation. It becomes easier to keep the highly visible rate down, but taxes might go up to cover the infrastructure costs instead.So I’m skeptical. If there was an analysis that showed a drop in rates that was not 3X higher than the profit margins of the private utility I’d be more open to the idea, but as presented this feels like back of the envelope math that generates savings by ignoring all the details that didn’t make their way onto the envelope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is absolutely a no-brainer for municipalities.  The private companies are charging a premium that they return to shareholders and give to executives.  Municipalities have excellent access to credit at rates significantly lower than the premium charged by utility companies.  The residents get cheaper access and more influence in how the utility is ran.The number of people that pay for-profit companies for natural gas (heat), electricity, and water in North America is absolutely bonkers. There is a specific concern about foreign corporations purchasing water rights in the American west.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42975492</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This doesn't feel like a "reasoning" challenge. The mental skill required to solve most of these seems to be the ability to loop over all known members of a category like "popular brand names" or "well-known actors" and see if they fit the clue.As a human, you'd expect to fail either because you didn't know a category member (e.g. as a non-American I have no idea WTF "Citgo" is; I could never get the answer to the first question because I have never seen that name before in my life) or because you weren't able to bring it to mind; the mental act of looping over all members of a category is quite challenging for a human.Admittedly this is something an AI system could in principle be REALLY good at, and it's interesting to test and see that current ones are not! But it seems weird to me to call what's being tested "reasoning" when it's so heavily focused on memory recall (and evaluating whether a candidate answer works or not is trivial once you've brought it to mind and doesn't really require any intelligent thought).(If the questions were multiple-choice, eliminating the challenge of bringing candidate answers to mind that is the main challenge for a human, then I'd agree it was a "reasoning" test.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is so interesting to me is that the reasoning traces for these often have the correct answer, but the model fails to realize it.Problem 3 ("Dry Eye"), R1: "Wait, maybe "cubitus valgus" – no, too long. Wait, three letters each. Let me think again. Maybe "hay fever" is two words but not three letters each. Maybe "dry eye"? "Dry" and "eye" – both three letters. "Dry eye" is a condition. Do they rhyme? "Dry" (d-rye) and "eye" (i) – no, they don't rhyme. "Eye" is pronounced like "i", while "dry" is "d-rye". Not the same ending."Problem 8 ("Foot nose"), R1: "Wait, if the seventh letter is changed to next letter, maybe the original word is "footnot" (but that's not a word). Alternatively, maybe "foot" + "note", but "note" isn't a body part."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not a fan of these "gotchas" because they don't test for what we really care about.Like counting the number of R's in strawberry, many of these are character-counting or character manipulation problems which tokenization is not well-suited for.I'm sure an engineer could come up with a clever way to train for this, but that seems like optimizing for the wrong thing.IMO these questions go in the wrong direction. Character permutation is a problem for "Software 1.0", not LLMs. Just as you wouldn't use an LLM to multiply 2 large numbers, you'd use a calculator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992336</guid></item><item><title>13.

But the formula x = 2^{log_2(m)}-m is a complicated way to say x=0. Did you mean that?When memory got bigger, I kept the literal dictionary in memory, but compressed it on secondary memory for fast transfer. The compression was trivial: store a suffix preceded by one byte that contained the length of the prefix that the word shared with its predecessor in dictionary order.We also added one byte per enry for affixing info, e.g. whether in- (or im- or ir-) is preferred over un-, whether a final consonant is doubled before adding a suffix that begins with a vowel, part of speech, etc. Although there were lots of such attributes, the number of distinct combinations of attributes that actually occurred was fewer than 256, so could be coded into one byte, and decoded by lookup in a 256-entry table. I automated the construction of that table, which would change if a dictionary revision created a new combination of attributes.With affixing info we could at the same time be more aggressive about affixing, and make fewer mistakes like allowing -s on a word that cannot be used as a noun or a verb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There used to be a page of Doug McIlroy "facts". I managed to hunt this page down by searching around.http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/c28f07b5840216c4...One of the "facts" is:
&gt; Doug McIlroy can address 8 terabytes of RAM with only 32 bits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The compression was trivial: store a suffix preceded by one byte that contained the length of the prefix that the word shared with its predecessor in dictionary orderThis is more or less what was speculated upon as compatible with his stemming ideas [1], but I (and partly McIlroy1982) doubt you ever really needed the fancy hashing-compression in the first place (though I'm sure it was fun to figure out!).  I got better perf (3x faster on a 5500 word document with an 82,000 word "unabridged" dictionary that prefix-compresses to only 278K which would fit on a 360K floppy of the era) than v7spell on v7 with just a merge algorithm somewhat more finely tuned against that format.  Of course, on a shared computer getting either the streaming disk access (without seeks spoiling the party) or all that RAM to yourself (without swapping spoiling the party) is a guess.  And, yeah, probably the background Doug mentions is all in the combined-unix-git-history by now { and it would not have been as attractive an academic paper :-) }.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42931145&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42962394</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to create persistent package installations on the Steam Deck using the Nix package manager. It outlines the limitations of the Steam Deck's default package management system, which does not maintain installed packages after rebooting. The author provides a step-by-step guide on configuring Nix to enable persistent installations, allowing users to maintain their software setup across restarts. The guide also covers the advantages of using Nix, such as its ability to create reproducible environments and manage dependencies effectively. Overall, the article serves as a practical resource for Steam Deck users looking to enhance their gaming experience with persistent software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't realize you could install Nix on any Linux distro.  It actually looks really straightforward:https://forum.elivelinux.org/t/how-to-install-nix-packages-o...I'm giving it a go now in the easily undoable single-user "no-daemon" mode.Super excited how approachable this makes Nix, I've put this off for many years due to what turned out to be an incorrect assumption about the level of commitment!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; you can either run NixOS (which isn’t ideal on a Steam Deck)I've actually been using NixOS on my Legion Go to give me the SteamOS experience while I wait for the official image from Valve [1].I knew that Valve had whitelisted /nix, but seeing how the author explicitly loads Nix in Bash:    .nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

makes me wonder how it works in game mode.  Say that someone uses Nix to install a game like YARG that's not in the Steam store [2].  That will install the game to /nix/store and write an alias to the user's desktop.  /home/deck is not immutable, so you could add the desktop file as a non-Steam game, and everything will work as expected, right?What are the boundaries between things that work everywhere, things that only work after you've loaded a bash profile (e.g. from a terminal), and things that only work in NixOS?  What if a package wants to run at login?  What if it uses its own systemd rules?[1] https://github.com/Jovian-Experiments/Jovian-NixOS/[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991513&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love using Nix for retro gaming setups.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is probably the joint most important piece of software on my system next to my window manager.The elevator pitch I give for this software is "QMK for any keyboard" - you can use layers, tap dance etc. with regular keyboards that have programming symbols in sane locations with dedicated keys.I use this with a Logitech Ergo K860, and have taken it a step further to integrate with my window manager so that layers change automatically based on the focused application[1].[1]: https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komokana&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd also recommend checking out https://github.com/houmain/keymapper if you're interested in context aware remaps (based on OS, application, device). It's cross-platform as well.Keymapper was posted here ~10 days ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42871040, but the link received relatively little attention, so I assume it might have been missed by many.Disclaimer: I'm active on the issue threads and a big fan. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi platform is an awesome quality for a tool like that: when you do have a customization like that, it's a huge value-loss when it can't be passed on across system boundaries.That being said, this appears to be an active mapper that needs to be running in the background. Classic "with great power comes great responsibility". I'd rather have something less powerful that only offers the customizations that can be loaded into the native keyboard mapping engines. On Windows, I am extremely happy with a few tweaks I've built with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC). Mostly removing some of the worst pain points of my home language layout (German) that drive many of my compatriots to using an English layout (basically what nodeadkeys does on Linux, but with a few improvements like opting in to dead keys behavior with altgr+’). Would be super awesome to have a UI for setting up that kind of mapping that can output configurations for the native mapping mechanism across a range of platforms. And that only offers mappings that can be configured using the native system on all platforms supported, the intersection of capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991019</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the profound impact of Noether's Theorem on physics, illustrating how it establishes a fundamental connection between symmetries and conservation laws. Proposed by mathematician Emmy Noether in 1915, the theorem articulates that for every continuous symmetry in a physical system, there exists a corresponding conserved quantity. This relationship has transformed our understanding of various fields, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity, by providing a deeper theoretical foundation for explaining the behavior of physical systems. The article highlights the theorem’s historical significance and ongoing relevance in contemporary theoretical physics.&lt;/p&gt;

So people either didn't do it or only advertised their events in their group chats or Facebook groups.Thus I started writing some code, and now people can add an event by just logging in with their OpenStreetMap account and filling out a small form. We still display our events in a Wiki by using the API and a small Mediawiki plugin to maintain human compatibility for people who are used to getting events from the wiki. There are also RSS feeds, iCalendar subscriptions and event file downloads, so that everybody can subscribe to events in their preferred form.It's a small project that I've been running for a couple years and it's really rewarding to see people using it every day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During my time on Apple Maps we were encouraged to attend OSM's Mappy Hours. It was a great experience to see just how much manual effort still goes into creating maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some other event sites for open source events are on:https://wiki.debian.org/SocialEventAndConferenceCalendars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42993044</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;CoLinux is an open-source project that allows users to run Linux natively on Windows systems by using the co-operative Linux (CoLinux) technology. It enables dual operating system functionalities without the need for emulation, providing an efficient way for developers and users to experience and utilize Linux applications alongside Windows. The site offers documentation, downloads for the CoLinux software, and a community forum for support and discussion among users interested in this integration of Linux and Windows environments.&lt;/p&gt;

It did beat dual booting though. Worked like a charm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this for years until early 2009, when I formatted my laptop with Ubuntu 8.04 and started running Windows in a VM. IE was still important back then and I needed to check web sites with it.I was running Rails and other web frameworks inside colinux. I switched after I made sure that everything I was running in Windows for my work did run well in Linux. I remember that those very same programs run faster in Ubuntu than in Windows. The most notable improvement was GIMP's starting time: many times faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This got stalled needing the 64 bit support to be completed.It worked pretty decently at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989923</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the criminal networks involved in sand trafficking across Latin America, highlighting how organized crime groups exploit the high demand for sand in construction and infrastructure projects. It details the environmental impact of illegal sand extraction, including ecosystem damage and erosion, while also emphasizing the challenges law enforcement faces in combating this illicit trade. Additionally, the piece explores the connections between sand trafficking and broader issues of corruption and organized crime in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, it seems like you must just be destined to be in this business if you are in it. Nobody goes on the Internet and researches how to get started sand trafficking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is "Sand Mafia" in India also. A lot of people have sadly lost their lives and the corruption / rot runs deep. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_theft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is happening in SEA, too.  The Chinese show up with a giant ship to some rather remote island, offer a few promises or money in exchange to take a little, and completely ravage what beach exists.  I've seen it firsthand.To my knowledge, but not necessarily fact, they aren't even working with the country's national government, but small poor regional governments directly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957864</guid></item><item><title>20.

Then again I have no expertise in this field whatsoever so can only conjecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42988303</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of interfaces in programming, particularly in the context of the Go programming language. It explains how interfaces allow for flexibility and abstraction by enabling different types to be treated in a uniform way as long as they implement the same methods. The piece also covers practical examples of defining and using interfaces, their benefits, such as promoting code reusability and reducing dependencies, and best practices for implementing interfaces effectively. Overall, it serves as a guide for understanding and utilizing interfaces to improve code quality and design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comparisons to python are a bit dated now. All of the examples can be implemented in python using typing extensions [0] and statically checked before runtime using mypy [1].[0] https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html (from Python 3.5 - released Sep 2015)[1] https://github.com/python/mypy (v0.1 released Sep 2009)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A quirk of Go is that I can cast a `[]string` to `interface{}`, but I cannot cast `[]string` to `[]interface{}`. This blog post is my go-to explanation for why the second is not possible but the former is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are mindful of performance,
one thing to be careful of, is that interfaces often prevent inlining and can cause performance issues.Generally speaking the Go compiler seems to have trouble with inlining, PGO (profile guided optimization) can help though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946270</guid></item><item><title>22.

For now it will allow the team to get details and suggestions about books, vote on books that they want to read, set a timeframe for their reading cycle, and when the cycle ends, it reaches out with a few relevant questions about the book!Has any of you organized or participated in a virtual book club before? What was your experience, any challenges that you faced or features that were missing?Fire away!PS: Let me know if you have any feedback about the website too, it was my first time creating a landing page!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this idea! We wrote up a post about the book club we were running at our small company, and it was great for expanding people’s interest and understanding of different topics: https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/05/running-a-company-boo...Picking a book was often the hardest part though, so this tool having recommendations and voting seems like a really nice solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some landing page feedback: As Slack is mostly used in a corporate context the first thing people will look at when they add an app to their workspace would be the privacy policy and to see if it's trustworthy. Would maybe be worth it to expand on that a bit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990540</guid></item><item><title>25.

While I've seen other simulations of hand-held games, I really appreciate how they even include the instruction booklets with many of them. It really gives the feeling of actually having these games, some of which (several Game &amp; Watch games) I owned as a child, and many others that I always wanted but didn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like that Nintendo DS Game &amp; Watch Collection is included, so we are basically playing an emulation of an emulation :)Also, I never knew Game &amp; Watch were cloned by Elektronika.  It's funny to see what are almost the exact same games with subtle differences (e.g. "Octopus" vs "Ocean Secrets").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's this too!https://www.emuvr.net/I was hoping RetroFab was going to be electro-mechanical games.You might like this music videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVDaT6b8Lbc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989628</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Ensuring that the benefits of AGI are broadly distributed is critical. The historical impact of technological progress suggests that most of the metrics we care about (health outcomes, economic prosperity, etc.) get better on average and over the long-term, but increasing equality does not seem technologically determined and getting this right may require new ideas.I don't see why we should trust OpenAI's promises now, when they've broken promises in the past.See the "OpenAI has a history of broken promises" section of this webpage: https://www.safetyabandoned.org/In my view, state AGs should not allow them to complete their transition to a for-profit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use. ... Moore’s law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger.Moore waited at least five years [1] before deriving his law.  On top of that, I don't think that it makes much sense to compare commercial pricing schemes to technical advancements.[1] http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/moore-crammingm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've just gotten through a big second generation of available models, but at least for the projects I'm on, I still feel just as far away as ever as being able to trust responses. I spent a few hours this weekend working on a side project that involved setting up a graphql server with a few basic query resolvers and field resolvers, and my experience with 4o, R1, o3-mini-high were all akin to arguing with too-confident junior engineers that were confused, without realizing it, about what they thought they knew. And this was basic stuff about simple graphql resolvers. I did have my first experience of o3-mini-high (finally, after much arguing) being able to answer something that R1 couldn't, though.It's weird, because it's still wildly useful and my ideas for side projects are definitely more expansive than they used to be. And yet, I'm really far from having any fear of replacement. Almost none of the answers I'm getting are truly nailing the experience of teaching me something new, while also having perfect accuracy. (I'm on ChatGPT+, not pro.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42993987</guid></item><item><title>27.

But even then I must say, I still can't intuitively see the benefits of installing a whole plugin. I'm not doubting there are benefits, it's just that I'm reluctant to invest the days and weeks installing and using these plugins to know how they work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m in the process of ditching vscode and for now settled on nvim as the replacement. Currently, I still use Dendron for taking notes. There are some suggestions for companion plugins at the end of the readme - does anyone have additional suggestions?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities and misconceptions surrounding generational garbage collection in programming. It explains how generational garbage collection is designed to optimize memory management by categorizing objects based on their lifetime, focusing on the efficient reclamation of short-lived objects. The author addresses common challenges and confusions related to this approach, clarifying how it operates in different programming environments. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles to better leverage garbage collection for improved application performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s the choice of benchmarks.GenGC is an improvement if you have:- High allocation rate. I think his benchmarks do have high allocation rate so this part is fine.- Large heap. I think splay has a large heap so this part is fine.- Lots of objects in that large heap that simply survive one GC after another, while the allocation rate is mostly due to objects that die immediately. This is the part that splay doesn’t have. Splay churns all of its large heap.Empirically, really big software written in GC’d languages have all three of these qualities. They have heaps that are large enough for GenGC to be profitable. They allocate at a high enough rate. And most of the allocated objects die almost immediately, while most of the objects that survive GC survive for many GC cycles.You need that kind of test for it to be worth it, and you would have such a test if you had big enough software to run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My understanding is that splay is more of a benchmark that you try to make generational GC not hurt too much. It allocates lots of long-lived objects that it holds onto for the full test, and for JS at least it then hangs strings off of those objects. It's pretty easy to make a generational GC just add an extra copy for no benefit with splay.In SpiderMonkey, we had to add pretenuring in order to avoid slowing down splay too much. As in, identify specific allocation sites that create long-lived allocations, and allocate them directly from the older generation instead of having them go through the nursery. It's sort of selectively disabling generational GC on an allocation site granularity. (Also, make sure you're not storing nursery strings inside of tenured objects. While it's possible they'll be quickly overwritten by different strings, it's much more likely that they're going to last as long as the object does.)Within Octane, the RegExp subtest had the biggest gain from allocating strings in the nursery. (But that's going from generational objects -&gt; generational objects and strings. Non-generational objects -&gt; generational objects might show up more on something else.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C# (and .NET at large) use generational GV to great effect and there are some good writeups on the different modes you can run the GC in and its performance profiles. .NET has been generational GC since forever and you can’t swap out the GC engine so you won’t be able to find an analogous comparison, but it’s probably the current generational GC SOTA for a one-size-fits-all (with admittedly two different allocation/cleanup roles: server and workstation; and with (new to .NET 9) a new option to configure the GC to act as if it were running alone on the system (the old default, i.e. not sharing resources with other apps on the same os) or to more cooperatively try to manage allocation patterns.Just mentioning this in case someone wants to read up on a different GC and play around with benchmarks. There is a fair amount of inner workings info and real-world results to dive into.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990819</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is a decent article, with some distilled wisdom... Though I also think it has some repeating status-quo mumbo-jumbo.Every time somebody says a soft-science claim and presents it as a fact, I try to vet it with this heuristic: It can't just sound good, or satisfying, but is it actually true? Imagine whether a case can be made for the exact opposite statement, or whether there may be circumstances that the statement is obviously false.For example, once a principal engineer asserted rather confidently, "At my level, the most important work you can do is usually in Jira." That's a claim that's hard to assess with any objectivity, but I can certainly imagine a different principal engineer feeling the exact opposite, and I can certainly think of many companies where they wouldn't hire/want a principal engineer primarily for Jira work.Back to this article, any time somebody says "A manager is X" or a "staff is X" I think to myself... well can I think of a company that would want managers who focus almost entirely on not X? The answer is almost always yes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cultural fit to me is a completely inadequate term to describe what I'm thinking about in an interview.Are they going to be an arsehole? This is my biggest worry after dealing with a couple, first as people above me then as members of my first team as a combined team lead/line manager. This is about being able to be reasoned with and not destroying team morale.  I have always tended to feel that being right is more important than harmony but over time I realised how many of my "right" decisions were balanced by wrong ones and however many times I thought I saved the team with some good idea, someone else did it just as much with another one.In other words I'm on the very edge, at best, of being the arsehole myself. Someone who is further over the line than me definitely makes it miserable to go to work. I want my team to get on reasonably and each get a feeling of fullfillment out of the day and feel respected which requires good behaviour from me but also from them.  I perhaps wouldn't want to say this to my own boss (who is ok) but I really care about this more than about the company itself.Companies have no loyalty and will make you redundant at the drop of a hat.  They also sometimes do silly things which doom them and prevent you from being able to save the situation.  You get given impossible things to do and stress out trying to do them.  While this is happening, however, we can have a reasonable week without undue drama, fights, humiliation or fear. There's no reason that good software can't be the end result but more importantly you'll have an experienced team at the end who get better and better at working together and are potentially going to stay on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For those looking to transition into leadership,My biggest pet peeve in this industry is the self anointing of the “leadership” attribute.Its management. Just management. Some managers may be leaders, but most aren’t. Some ICs may be leaders. Most aren’t. Some politicians may be leaders, but most aren’t.Or maybe I just never grasped what leadership means. Either in the context of the world or our industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42960068</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of integrating observability with financial operations (FinOps) to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of cloud infrastructure management. It highlights how the Vantage integration with Grafana Cloud allows organizations to gain insights into their cloud spending while also monitoring performance metrics. This synergy between observability and FinOps helps organizations make informed decisions, optimize resource usage, and reduce costs, ultimately leading to better overall performance and financial health in cloud operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On my last job, the company was using NewRelic (for two environments we was using at the time) which had an ok cost and "suddenly" we'd been forced to use Datadog which costs way over for our budget and after the person responsible for the change and integration see the estimated high costs, started to cut everything possible to keep it low. So, our tools degraded and we wasn't able to test things on staging and collect metrics like we was when using NewRelic. FinOps is certainly a good approach, but we need it from the start!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the advantages of self-hosting is that you don't need this level of FinOps. You also don't have to live in fear of bill-mageddon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am big fan of "cost monitoring".In my previous company I had a good setup for costs monitoring - including release to release comparisons, drill downs, statistics, etc.After each release I looked at this data. It saved a lot of $, by simple fixes like "why we are calling this API twice?".It also quite some issues that weren't strictly customer related, but weren't apparent from other type of data (you will always have some "unknown unknowns" in your monitoring, and costs data seem to be pretty wide net to catch some of those)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42965499</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores author Gary Shteyngart's personal journey with fashion, particularly focusing on his experience of getting a bespoke suit. It delves into how clothing can influence self-perception and identity while discussing themes of masculinity, cultural background, and self-love. Shteyngart reflects on the societal pressures related to appearance and the emotional significance of investing in tailored attire, ultimately framing this experience as part of a broader quest for acceptance and self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a different body but a similar relationship to it as the author. My wife is very stylish and often wears striking jewellery. She gets a lot of compliments and doesn't have to work hard to be at ease socially, whereas for the most part I'd be happy to pass through the world unseen. We've had some modest financial success of late, and I'm resolved to being kinder to myself but also taking myself a little more seriously. I think it's easy to write off fashion as something laboured and fake and innately suspect, especially when you're an introvert and a bit of a nerd living the life of the mind. But I've come to accept that my body has value, a voice of its own, and is part of me that I can't and don't want to be rid of. I'm not really ready for tailored clothing (and I flatter myself it'd be wasteful when I lose all the weight) but I've started dressing better, sports jackets instead of hoodies, shirts instead of t-shirts. For the first time in my life I own more than two pairs of shoes. I am sure I would still look shambolic to anyone with an eye for the details (I can pull off dishevelled academic better than Ivy Style) but I feel so much more confident and relaxed. I no longer feel like I've written off half of myself, and I like the whole a lot more because of that. It was wonderful to read Gary's journey in a similar direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a real shame that bespoke tailoring has all but died out. These days you have to live in (or near) the largest cities in the world, or financial hubs if you want bespoke service that is local.Most tailoring houses do travel around, offering trunk shows and such.I was lucky enough that I had a close relative that worked as a tailor back in the 50s and 60s, so from the first suit I wore was actually a bespoke piece.When I moved away, and entered the professional workforce, I soon discovered that bespoke suits started at $4k-$5k. I settled with a reputable shop that did made-to-measure for a third, and was happy with the results.I don't really wear suits (and tailored clothing) too much these days. The world has moved much more into casual and comfy clothes, and the sartorial world is mostly reserved for the hobbyists or wealthy people in conservative (work) fields.But, still, wearing a full set of perfectly tailored suit, shirt, and shoes feels nothing short but incredible. There should be nothing uncomfortable about it - which is the general critique for people not wanting to wear a suit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  I touched a clump of Australian wool, and noted how superior my South American sheep was to its antipodean cousin.

He touched a clump of hard wearing medium or strong merino wool; ultrafine and superfine merino come in softer and finer than his 21 micron South American sheep.https://www.isobaa.com/en-au/blogs/tales-from-the-eweniverse...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989062</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary article makes it sound like it’s somehow surprising that sea turtles can swim. The paper itself clarifies that it’s more a question of whether there are trends in the directionality of their swimming.&gt; Studies that compared turtle movements to oceanographic drifters suggest that swimming by young sea turtles directs their oceanic dispersal [19,21]. In addition, research in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic suggests that young oceanic-stage turtles actively swim and there may be distinct differences among species in orientation, dispersal and swimming behaviour [19,21]. Understanding whether and when juvenile turtles are active swimmers or passive drifters is critical for determining dispersal trajectories, exposure and transition times in areas impacted by anthropogenic activities (e.g. oil spills) and connectivity between populations and habitats [29]. Without basic biological and behavioural data, it is difficult to improve assessments of anthropogenic impacts on protected species, necessitating conservative or precautionary approaches to management using ‘best available data’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mainly, they die. Very high attrition rate. Watching turtle egg laying at Mon Repos Beach near Bundaberg is fantastic. I'd love to see the hatching as well. (Leatherbacks, loggerheads and green turtles there)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tldr; They found that sea turtles have been swimming in the sea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42948807</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ada was the first language they threw at us in university back in '98. At the time, it felt like learning Latin to become a poet, but looking back, those lessons—rigor, clarity, and discipline—have aged better than some modern frameworks. Ada may not trend on GitHub, but it quietly shaped a generation of better programmers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has anyone developed in SPARK [0]?My understanding, its significantly safer than Rust (and based on Ada) with equal performance.A comparison chart of Ada vs Rust vs SPARK [1].Most notable: Rust mainly provides memory safety ... but SPARK provides not just memory safety, but also safety from all run-time errors, formal properties, constraint checks, and more.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_(programming_language)[1] https://blog.adacore.com/should-i-choose-ada-spark-or-rust-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recall my C++ class, via the University of California Extension program.In the 1990s Bay Area, there was a catalog of hundreds of classes, taught after business hours or on weekends. The classes for security certification, or BGP routing, or C++, teacher and students were usually industry professionals.We learned C++ object design of a style I would consider fairly strict, strong typing. Details escape me at the moment.But I do remember the two graybeard Ada programmers sitting in the back of the room: "C++ compiler will accept that? Are you kidding?"Raytheon or Honeywell, I think. Missile drivers.Ada programmers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42993086</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sympathize with the authors pain, and at least from the comments, it sounds like most have a similar view of CORS.  Many weeks of face -&gt; keyboard in response.At some point trying to write JS, I really started believe that the people who implemented CORS did it just to break every single part of the world wide web that might ever be enjoyable.It really felt like somebody held out a beautiful idea with AJAX, and requests lacking synchronization, and then the only response was endless exploits, security holes, patches that took away functionality, and posts like the authors.  "This idea seems so simple...nevermind, 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' ERROR"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can impose a timeout on a fetch with a one liner:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal...Part of the awkwardness in the post is also mixing what looks like express with promises. I think using an async function as the handler with express 5 would probably feel a lot nicer.I agree about CORS being frustrating. I think we should have allowed totally anonymous fetch requests across domains for saved to home screen PWAs (or with a permission prompt.) Missing that feature means you end up needing native apps for a lot of things that otherwise are totally reasonable web apps. CORS does make sense though because the alternative is drive by attacks against your local network from random web pages. And since the S in IOT stands for security that seemed like a bad idea at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It was also getting harder and harder to debug as JavaScript has no timeout functionality I would have had to wrap that request in another promise.I'm pretty sure you could use an AbortController to address this? But it's one of those things you have to know about. I completely understand the author's frustration with CORS, but I don't think JS is to blame here. I have felt a similar level of frustration whenever I try to use a language other than JS to work with JSON. Does that mean the language sucks? I would say no. I don't think this made a compelling case for avoiding JS, but I would never want to deny someone the catharsis from venting about technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42968039</guid></item><item><title>39.

The batteries will come with a reprogrammed charge cycle count of 0, an unlikely serial number of all-zeroes/ones/nines or 123456789 etc., and with about 50% of its marketed capacity.As soon as you bring up a refund/warranty errand with the retailer they will offer a 50% discount for the battery in return for you not giving them a 1-star rating. Now you've still paid them for a bad battery, and you've helped keeping the systemic economic crime alive by not warning other customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/2025.02.09-074637/https://www.heise.de/en...As you cannot deny cookies without paying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the establishment of a public power utility in Massena, New York, highlighting the benefits it brings to the community, such as lower electricity costs and increased local control over energy sources. It details the motivations for transitioning from private to public utility management, including the potential for renewable energy initiatives and improved infrastructure. The piece also addresses the challenges faced during this transition, including regulatory hurdles and the need for a comprehensive energy plan to sustain the utility's operations. Overall, the narrative emphasizes the community's commitment to energy independence and sustainable practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my area when National Grid abandoned our local power station they sabotaged it before ditching it on the city. Now we got an abandoned hulk that's an environmental and economic disaster and will require millions to dismantle or repurpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massena has benefitted heavily from being a town with a flat/declining population and almost no industrial growth. They are entirely beholden to NYPA (also a public utility) for their cheap energy, and unfortunately for them, NYPA has already released a proposed rate change to triple their preferred rates over the next ~5 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with publicly owned power coops, which the article touches on repeatedly, is that they form a model for the straightforward provisioning of modern necessities. Left unchecked, this can end up spreading. For example, my municipal electric company got bored and decided to branch out into providing Internet service. $75/mo for a gigabit symmetric, no caps, no contractual pricing games. And now that they've finished building out the whole town, they're using that experience to help smaller neighboring towns build out their own networks as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992032</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if I'm just misunderstanding the article or not, but it feels like an overengineered solution, reminescent of SAML's replacement instructions (just a hardcoded and admittedly way better option --- but still in a similar vein of "text replacement hacks").I know it's not the most elegant thing ever, but if it needs to be JSON at the post-signing level, why not just something like `["75cj8hgmRg+v8AQq3OvTDaf8pEWEOelNHP2x99yiu3Y","{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"]`, in other words, encode the JSON being signed as a string.
This would then ensure that, even if the "outer" JSON is parsed and re-encoded, the string is unmodified. It'll even survive weird parsing and re-encoding, which the regex replacement option might not (unless it's tolerant of whitespace changes).(or, for the extra paranoid: encode the latter to base64 first and then as a string, yielding something like `["75cj8hgmRg+v8AQq3OvTDaf8pEWEOelNHP2x99yiu3Y","eyJmb28iOiJiYXIifQ"]` --- this way, it doesn't look like JSON anymore, for any parsers that try to be too smart)If the outer needs to be an object (as opposed to array), this is also trivially adapted, of course: `{"hmac":"75cj8hgmRg+v8AQq3OvTDaf8pEWEOelNHP2x99yiu3Y","json":"{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"}`.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a feeling that idea 2 is a recipe for disaster:&gt; Add the tag and the exact string you signed to the object, validate the signature and then validate that the JSON object is the same as the one you got.In cryptographic practice, redundant information usually spells disaster, because inevitably, someone will use the copy that wasn't verified.But let's dig into it. If I understand this correctly, the suggestion is to have something like this:    {
        "object": "with",
        "some": "properties",

        "signatureInfo": {
            "signedString": "{\"object\":\"with\",\"some\":\"properties\"}",
            "signature": "... base64-encoded-signature ..."
        }
    }

It's mentioned that "the downside is your messages are about twice the size that they need to be". In my opinion, this scheme is pointless. To verify "the JSON object is the same as the one you got", you have to do what?1. Parse the outer object as JSON, extract and remove signatureInfo.2. Verify the signature.3. Parse the signedString as JSON.4. Verify that the object you got in step 1 equal to object you got in step 3 using a some kind of deep equality.First of all, this is error prone, and as underspecified as JSON is, there are potential exploits if the comparison isn't done carefully. But even worse, if you think about it, the outer JSON is entirely useless, since you need to parse the inner JSON anyway -- so why not just use it directly?It seems to me that this suggestion is strictly worse than just sending the inner part:    {
        "signedString": "{\"object\":\"with\",\"some\":\"properties\"}",
        "signature": "... base64-encoded-signature ..."
    }

Yes, it's no longer "in-band", but I don't think it was really in-band before, it was just out-of-band with an outer layer of redundant information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the deeply dissatisfying parts of the Matrix spec.  They didn't have any constraints forcing them to embed signatures within the json objects, but they elected to invent their own signing scheme and do it anyways, despite being a greenfield.  It also includes support for a special "unsigned" portion for extra data that comes along (which is often used for the server to inject the age of an event).I don't think the protocol still injects the signature into event structures, but this weird "unsigned" field is still there looking at the source json for a message I sent today, but it's possible it's removed after processing and Fluffychat is just removing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990948</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of cell-based architecture using the analogy of a zombie outbreak to illustrate how this architectural approach functions. It describes how cell-based architecture divides systems into smaller, independent units called "cells," which can operate autonomously yet communicate and collaborate with others. This model enhances scalability, resilience, and flexibility in system design, allowing for easier management of large-scale applications. The zombie scenario demonstrates the efficiency and adaptability of cells in responding to challenges, making the complex topic more relatable and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

The difference between a pure horizontally-scaled cluster and cell-based architecture is that traffic destined for a compromised cell does not get routed to a healthy cell. Fault isolation (preventing noisy neighbors and poison pills from spilling over to progressively more cells) is a primary tenet of cell-based architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came here for Cell Broadband Engine Architecture and was very excited about the whole zombie idea -_-&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure this will come in handy for me at some point. I've led a team through moving parts of their terraform/aws monolith to cells. Some people are able to grasp what cell-based architecture is and when it's useful pretty easily, but for a few it just doesn't click.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42961855</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It absolutely feels like all the major web browsers have given up on being the User Agent, and instead act as the web developer's agent. I feel like I'm constantly fighting my web browser to do what I want rather than what the website wants.Case in point which I'm fighting with at this very minute: HTTP. I want to access a site over HTTP, not HTTPS. I know it supports HTTP. I have used HTTP in the past. But my browser insists that I want HTTPS instead, despite my manually typing http://HSTS is an abomination, directly ignoring the user's command to do what the site wants instead. As if I'm some kind of bystander of my computer, instead of the user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This. While I don’t make my own extensions or bookmarklets, I chose to develop for the web because of its openness and how it’s not owned by a singular entity. I do not want to be at the mercy of Apple or Google with their distribution channels.With Google’s manifest v3 debacle, it’s clear we need to fight continuously and ruthlessly to keep the web for the people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just talking about this with my wife. I have so many tabs open that I run out of memory but I find that all the solutions to save sites or resources I find and need to reference in the future are aweful. Bookmarks suck, search sucks, saving browser sessions sucks.

When the main AI has gotten so good that GAN becomes a dice roll, training is considered finished.Human brains are completely different implementation and nothing is stopping us from instantly spotting AI, at least for now, but computers shouldn't be able to. Isn't that the case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's the first time I've seen "deepfake" used to refer to generated text, isn't that term usually used for generated imagery/audio which is passed off as real?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42986613</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;Google edited a Super Bowl advertisement featuring its new AI technology after it was criticized for including false information. The original ad, which aimed to showcase the capabilities of the AI, unintentionally disseminated inaccuracies that sparked backlash. In response to the concerns, Google took immediate action to correct the misleading content before the ad was aired. The incident underscores the challenges tech companies face in ensuring that AI-generated content is accurate and reliable, particularly when presented to a large audience during high-profile events like the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the origins and evolution of the term "nickname," tracing its roots back to the Old English word "eac," meaning "also" or "more." The piece discusses how this term underwent linguistic changes over time, leading to the modern understanding of nicknames as informal or affectionate alternatives to proper names. It highlights the playful, often creative nature of nicknames and their significance in personal identity and social interactions. The author emphasizes how nicknames can reflect relationships and cultural nuances, demonstrating their importance in human communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Likewise there are several patronymic surnames from the Welsh “ap &lt;father’s name&gt; (son of) that have ended up as new surnames retained the “ap” in several cases, mainly in reduced form at the start of the surname, as in Upjohn (from ap John), Powell (from ap Hywel), Price (from ap Rhys), Pritchard (from ap Richard), and Bowen (from ab Owen).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Harris and Harrison are other examples of this kind of surname.In Dublin, the bus routes are bilingual and a couple of years ago I noticed that the Irish translation of Harristown is Baile Anraí¹.  When I first saw “Baile Anraí” as the destination for a passing bus, I wondered where Henry’s Town might be. I then figured that Henry and Harris must be variations of the same name and that Anraí is the Irish version of both names.Sure enough, when I check this now, Wikipedia concurs². The article it cites states that Harry is the “Medieval English form of Henry. In modern times it is used as a diminutive of both Henry and names beginning with Har.”³The surname Hanks may also derive from the use of Hank as a diminutive of Henry⁴¹ https://www.dublinbus.ie/getmedia/947fdcee-5f28-46e0-8785-ab...² https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_(given_name)³ https://www.behindthename.com/name/harry⁴ https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hank#Proper_noun&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another one to add is that Japanese boys names often end -rō (-郎, "nth son")... including the very plainly named 一郎 (Ichirō, "first son"), 二郎 (Jirō, "second son"), 三郎 (Saburō, "third son"), 四郎 (Shirō "fourth son"), 五郎 (Gorō, "fifth son"), 六郎 (Rokurō, "sixth son"), 七郎 (Shichirō "seventh son"), 八郎 (Hachirō, "eighth son") and 九郎 (Kurō, "ninth son")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43000316</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent unveiling of a newly restored portrait of St. Thomas Aquinas, which is believed to represent his true likeness after 750 years. It details the historical context of Aquinas, his contributions to theology and philosophy, and the significance of the portrait in shedding light on his image and legacy. The restoration was based on both artistic and scholarly research, reflecting the enduring influence of Aquinas' thoughts in contemporary Catholicism and Christian philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't this reconstruction a bit on the slim side? Aquinas was reportedly, let's say, a man of portly presence.I can't find a scholarly source on the matter, at the moment, but here are two quotes I found on the website of a nun[1] (no less, so probably written in good faith):&gt; St. Thomas was a huge heavy bull of a man, fat and slow and quiet; very mild and magnanimous but not very sociable; shy, even apart from the humility of holiness; and abstracted, even apart from his occasional and carefully concealed experiences of trance or ecstasy. (G.K. Chesterton)&gt; St. Thomas Aquinas was a compulsive over-eater who was not just fat but morbidly obese and physically grotesque. (Myron Shibley)[1] http://asksistermarymartha.blogspot.com/2009/01/how-fat-was-...(Fun fact, there's a reference to this in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, alluding to difficulties with the transport of the body over a staircase, which coincides with circumstances of G.K. Chesterton's passing, as described on that page.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first use of the word “android” comes from the discussion of a legendary mechanical talking head invented by Albertus Magnus. Thomas Aquinas couldn’t bear its babble and so he smashed it to bits. So, maybe he’s a patron saint of the anti-AI crowd?https://archive.org/details/b30337161&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypothesised cranial haematoma after accident with tree, died aged 48. Reconstruction aligns with paintings, but it wasn't clear if the reconstruction model was informed by the paintings so somewhat meaningless they agree.Also the diagnosis isn't informed by the craniometry from what I can read: it's a reconstruction and an unconnected diagnosis from reports of his death.Amusingly a website which had (nc)register.com but not theregister.com..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42996671</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces the Anthropic Economic Index, a new metric designed to measure and analyze the economic impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors. It aims to provide insights into how AI technologies influence economic growth, productivity, and job markets. The index combines various data sources and methodologies to offer a comprehensive view of AI's role in the economy, helping businesses, policymakers, and researchers understand its potential benefits and challenges. The initiative reflects Anthropic's commitment to responsible AI development and its implications for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see this analysis done for ChatGPT, which has a much bigger 'consumer' marketshare.I'm also very wary of their analysis method, given classifiers-gonna-classify. We already see it in their example of someone asking why their game is crashing and it buckets them into Computer &amp; Mathematical occupation. I'm guessing the original question was not that of a game developer but rather a game player, so can you really call this an occupational task? Sure it's in that domain, I guess, but in a completely different context. If I'm asking a question about how to clean my dish washer, that's hardly in repairman or industrial occupations.Still, it's cool they're doing this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This more or less confirms what I imagine most of us thought, AI is mostly used by engineers, or for engineering tasks. Makes sense, I wonder how much traffic comes from automated tasks (co-pilot, etc). Every time I read a report like this I do wonder if we'll ever see an ROI on LLMs. HUNDREDS of billions of dollars of spend, and 3 years in its still primarily the same crowd using it, and has yet to create a "killer" app beyond ChatGPT and Co-Pilot style IDE's. And its not like people aren't trying! Look at the recent YC batches, its all AI-for-industry. Idk man, I fear the economic reality on the backside of this kind of spend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like Anthropic has too much money on their hands and are looking for ways to spend it. It’s surprising to see lean AI startups accumulate fat so quickly. Usually this sort of wheel spinning is reserved for large corporations.And it’s not just them. To me this trend screams “valuations are too high”, and maybe hints at “progress might start to stagnate soon”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43000529</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides documentation for the PDFSyntax project, specifically detailing how to browse and analyze PDF files using the provided tools. It describes various commands and functionalities within the toolkit, including how to navigate the structure of a PDF document, view its objects and their attributes, and understand the syntax of PDF files. Additionally, the documentation emphasizes the importance of examining PDF content for developers and researchers working with PDF manipulation and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many moons ago I was tasked with extracting data from a bunch of PDFs. I made a tool to visualise how characters were laid out on the page and bounding boxes of all the elements.The project was in the end a complete failure and several people were upset at me for not delivering what I was supposed to.In present day, with the capabilities that are now available with LLMs to extract data from PDFs I 100% would go the route of utilising AI to extract the data they wanted. Back then that did not yet exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's pretty cool! I would have used it a lot at my previous job if it existed back then. In my ideal world it should work somewhat like https://lapo.it/asn1js/ -- you drop a file and it does all the stuff locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used the iText RUPS (free) for a while for debugging PDFs (as I have the "privilege" to work on code that extracts data from PDFs...). It looks like your introspection stuff might be a bit stronger, which would be great. I'll take it for a whirl.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43000303</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses common frustrations encountered by users of terminal applications, highlighting issues such as inconsistent keyboard shortcuts, challenges with text selection, and complications arising from various terminal emulators. The author expresses a desire for improved user experiences in terminal applications, advocating for more intuitive designs that enhance productivity and accessibility. The commentary encompasses personal anecdotes and suggestions for better usability, aiming to foster a conversation around these everyday terminal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or –help?I've said it before and I'll say it again: the error "Option `--help` not understood, did you mean `-help`? Use `-help` to display program options." is one of the most insulting things a program can say to me. `--help` is the lowest common denominator. You have to support it. I don't care what your program has to special case in its parsing, just do it. If I knew your program's preferred syntax, I wouldn't be asking it for help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s quite remarkable that the whole stack works as well as it does. I’m using a terminal emulator, which is running a shell, which launches an ssh connection, which opens a remote shell, which I use to attach a tmux session where another shell is already running, which I use to open a file in a text editor, which displays a cat emoji correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For copy-pasting text to/from the terminal, I prefer to use Mac shortcut Cmd+C. It doesn't work out of the box on Linux (you have to use Ctrl+Shift+C, because Ctrl+C sends SIGINT). But there's a simple way to make Cmd+C work universally across all apps by rebinding Cmd+C to send Ctrl+Insert and Cmd+V to send Shift+Insert. It turns out these alternative keybindings work everywhere (browsers, GUI apps, terminal, etc). I use keyd to do that in software, but some QMK keyboards can do that rebinding on the keyboard itself.This is my keyd config:  [ids]

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses common mistakes made when creating diagrams, emphasizing the importance of clarity and effective communication in visual representation. It highlights specific errors such as cluttered visuals, poor labeling, and ineffective use of color, which can confuse the audience and obscure the intended message. The author provides guidelines for creating better diagrams, including maintaining simplicity, ensuring proper alignment, and using consistent styles.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author got very close, but missing the forest for the trees.What a diagram really needs is a purpose. A clear need for the information to be conveyed.Who's to say that unlabeled arrows are a bad thing? Or that there's too much on a diagram? That depends on how it's used! What it's for.Adding context and explainers is certainly a Good Thing, but again, without an overarching reason for the diagram to even exist - who cares?Diagrams are a communication tool. No more, no less. The vast majority aren't up-to-date, complete or even completely accurate; for the same reason roadmaps aren't, let alone the map of the London Underground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That said, you probably don’t want to be making theoretical architecture diagrams most of the time.My take on this is that it's really hard to have one diagram to rule them all.  I think there's a time and a place for different kinds of diagrams, and I think it's ok to tell a story with a couple different ones.  For example, a conceptual diagram that complements the actual "as implemented" diagram.  One is a big of a "here's what we were thinking" and the other is "here's how we translated that to actual architecture".In my role of frequently having to manage up to executive management, investors, onboard new people, etc. the combination of conceptual plus actual is powerful.  I can describe the problem we're solving, provide a grokkable format for most levels of the org chart, and then have the details for those who want to dig in to discuss how we built (or plan to build) it and why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TFA correctly lists many sins with architecture diagrams, but misses the proverbial forest over metaphorical trees.IMO the mistakes mentioned in these diagrams stem from them actually being component diagrams disguised as architecture diagrams.While the astute would be technically correct in calling component diagrams a type of architecture diagrams, focusing on components is what typically leads to diagraming mistakes. Component diagrams are really useful when determining what competencies, licenses/subscriptions, etc. are required when for example evaluating fit of project inside of an existing ecosystem.However, when managing the system or making changes to it, you rarely care whether data is stored on S3 or local minio cluster, because at an interface level S3 merely a protocol. Yet, you do care about data dependencies and control boundaries.A component diagram may easily just connect application backend to S3-compatible storage component and call it a day, however in a full architectural diagram you would really want to see where e.g. the auth thingie comes from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990546</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;A study analyzing ancient DNA has identified the people believed to be the originators of the Indo-European language family. Researchers found that a group known as the Yamnaya, who lived in the Eurasian steppes around 5,000 years ago, played a central role in spreading this language family across Europe and parts of Asia. The study highlights the significance of migration and genetic exchange in shaping linguistic diversity, providing insights into how populations interacted and evolved over millennia. This research enhances our understanding of how languages can spread and shift through human movement and cultural contact.&lt;/p&gt;

Prof. Kristiansen is a leading researcher in this area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't read the papers in detail, but can someone explain how genetics can be used to trace spread of languages? For context, you don't need population movements for a language to spread (it is similar to religion). See this article for a logical explanation: https://medium.com/incerto/a-few-things-we-dont-quite-get-ab...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Reich, one of the principal authors of the study in question, wrote a book a few years back titled "Who We Are and How We Got Here", which I quite liked (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2605841954).  It predates some of this research, obviously, but it does have a chapter on the Indo-European origin question, along with chapters on a lot of other interesting paleo-DNA research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42969038</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emergence and implications of "GPT wrappers," applications built on top of GPT models that enhance user experience through tailored interfaces and features. The author, Andrew Chen, analyzes how these wrappers provide defensibility and value in a competitive landscape by addressing limitations of the underlying AI models, navigating regulatory challenges, and fostering user engagement. He emphasizes the importance of building community and trust around these applications, as well as considering long-term strategies for scaling and differentiation in the evolving tech ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having worked with AI and LLMs for quite a bit now as a "wrapper", I think the real key is that doing well (fast, accurate, relevant) requires a really, really good ETL process in front of the actual LLM.A "wrapper" will always be better than the the foundation models so long as it can do the domain-specific pre-generation ETL and data aggregation better; that is the true moat for any startup delivery solutions using AI.Your moat as a startup is really how good your domain-specific ETL is (ease of use and integration, comprehensiveness, speed, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'In recent years, innovative AI products that didn’t build their own models were derided as low-tech “GPT wrappers.” 'The ones derided were those claiming to be 'open-source XY' while being a standard tailwind template over an OpenAI call or those claiming revolutionay XY while 90% being the proprietary model underneath.
I am not sure how many were truly innovative that weren't cloneable in a very short time. Using models to empower your app is great, having the model be all of your app while you pitch it otherwise is to be derided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contrary take: "AI founders will learn the bitter lesson" (263 comments): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672790 the gist: "Better AI models will enable general purpose AI applications. At the same time, the added value of the software around the AI model will diminish."Both essays make convincing points, I guess we'll have to see. I like the Uber analogy here, maybe the winners will be some who use the tech in innovative ways that only leverage the underlying tech.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42971442</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The discover part at least seems to work acceptably.  Stumbled across the Lang's Fairy Books from the late 1800's and early 1900's that collected ~800 stories and 150 poem about mythology, folklore, and fairy tales from all over the Earth.  Never knew they existed.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langs%27_Fairy_BooksFrom WP though: 'authors, including E. Nesbit, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, and Arthur Conan Doyle, were influenced by the Langs' books. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote that "In English none probably rival either the popularity, or the inclusiveness, or the general merits of the twelve books of twelve colours which we owe to Andrew Lang and to his wife."Actually had a somewhat of tale of their own in publishing.'Although Andrew is often credited with selecting the stories in the Fairy Books, most of the work was done by Nora. Nora and a team of other writers, who were mostly women and included May Kendall and Violet Hunt, translated these into English and adapted them to suit Victorian and Edwardian notions of propriety. However, as Andrew acknowledges in a preface to The Lilac Fairy Book (1910), "The fairy books have been almost wholly the work of Mrs. Lang, who has translated and adapted them from the French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, and other languages."'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please add a column whether it is an actual recording of a human voice or AI generated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big thing I want in a book repository is a hierarchical list which will allow browsing by subject.One site which does work well for this (for textual books) and which is well-regarded is:https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/subjects.htmlwhich uses the LoC identifier for a given text.A project which past me wanted for future me was to read one book from each LoC category, and then to repeat that for sub-categories --- young me did that for the Dewey Decimal system for the high school library, but there were a number of gaps in the collection, and at that time, I didn't have the discipline or resources to make note of them so as to source books from other book repositories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42994440</guid></item><item><title>10.

Code is open source: https://github.com/r-follador/CubeTrek/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be great if one could select multiple "Catchments", since "Region" seems to select a whole country, while Catchment is dividing the island I'd like to capture into three pieces, one of which is huge and the others kind of small. Made a small demonstration of the problem here: https://imgur.com/a/tyudJvWAnother thing that would be awesome is if we could download the .glb files via a link/button in the visualizer, instead of having to manually grab the download link from the developer tools :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which DEM are you using? MERIT-DEM? It seems to exceed SRTM's coverage, but be smaller than ASTER's coverage (except it does include the Northernmost island in Greenlan which I think falls outside 83 N).  You might consider adding BEDMAP2 or REMA to cover Antarctica...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43001688</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an introduction to a knowledge-based framework known as KBook, which is designed to assist in gaining knowledge from various sources, particularly through reading and learning. It emphasizes the importance of structured learning and offers guidance on how to utilize the KBook framework to effectively manage and integrate information, enhance understanding, and foster better retention of knowledge. The site outlines the principles and methodologies behind KBook, encouraging users to adopt these practices to improve their learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Side note, but some people have such an evident talent for writing that it makes reading about _any_ topic a worthwhile experience. This author, Stefan Kruger, seems to be one of them.I almost wish this link was to a blog rather than to a book about K, for which I only have a perennial curiosity.Here's to hoping they consider writing said blog. I notice they have one but it only has 3 posts, all of which are about past Advent of Code puzzles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Readability is a property of the reader, not the language.Uiua[0]'s stack model is much more annoying to work with, but I really appreciate its embrace of unicode glyphs. Every other derivative of APL throws those out at the first opportunity, but when you have a lot of glyphs, you stop being so tempted to make different arities cause the same glyph to mean wildly different things, when the arity is not actually written down explicitly and depends on whether the next thing to the left is a parameter or another function. Once you can See The Matrix, this is the chief thing that still does make K and friends objectively unreadable in a way they don't have to be.[0]: https://uiua.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What seems to be a pity about most array languages is that in theory, they would be ideal DSL languages for SIMD and MIMD code exploration, but as far as I understand from ArrayCast guests, most are still interpreters at heart focusing on plain CPU execution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999650</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm in my late 40s and have been a software engineer in New England since graduating college.  We moved to Massachusetts in 1986, my father went to work at a startup company that was across the street from a DEC building and was in the DEC ecosystem.The pervasiveness of DEC here is amazing even after all these years.  My father in law also spent almost his entire career at DEC and retired as an HP employee.  One of my mentors in my late 20s (older Gen X) started his career there.   I've known many other people who worked at Digital.My only real exposure was being like 10-12 years old and getting trucked to the office during "crunch time" and I got to sit at the console on a VAX at one point and got to play early text based games on it.   This was weirdly right in the machine room at the operating console as there was some rework project in the room that my father had to be present for.    Later on at my first internship in the mid 1990s I had a QA job and I had to test software and I remember having to install on both Ultrix and DEC Unix and I got to use some of the Alpha machines.There are still all these buildings and artifacts all over the place from DEC all over MA.   I bank with DCU.   When I was in middle school my best friend and fellow computer nerd's father worked at another Massachusetts institution.. EMC.I never got pushed into software but it seemed to be pre-ordained... we always had computers and I was given free rein to play with them starting in the early-mid-80s but not really allowed to have video games and we always had business type machines and not the more fun consumer oriented stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in DEC history and haven't read "The Soul of a New Machine" by Tracy Kidder, you owe it to yourself to get a copy.  A Pulitzer Prize winner and IMO one of the best tech books ever written. It is a captivating book that chronicles the creation of Data General's Eclipse MV/8000 computer from the engineers' point of view.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The photo of the VT05 in the article doesn't do it justice:http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/vt05.htmlhttps://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/File:DEC_VT05_1217...This was before my time, but I imagine that the looks said the future is now, and you're piloting a spaceship as you code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43002906</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;MP Minerals got their magnet plant going. Good.MP Minerals operates the Mountain Pass, CA rare earths mine. This was the largest rare earths mine in the world at one time. After several shutdowns and two bankruptcies due to low rare earth prices, MP Minerals bought the mine in 2017 and had it producing ore in 2020. The mine already had a "beneficiation" plant, where raw ore goes in and a mix of rare earth elements, plus lots of unwanted tailings, come out. Unlike the plants in China, they have a process that doesn't require huge settlement ponds and vast amounts of water, so it doesn't create too much of a mess. It's mostly a mechanical process, and processes huge volumes of ore, yielding a much smaller volume of concentrate.What comes out of the benficiation plant needs more separation. That had to be sent to  China to be refined, because there were no plants to do the separation in the US. So MP Minerals got the US Department of Defense to fund a separation plant at Mountain Pass. This separates the different rare earths. It's mostly a chemical process. Again, what comes out is a lot less volume than goes in. The Mountain Pass separation plant has been working for a few years now.What comes out of the separation plant needs more purification and alloying. That's what the new plant in Texas does. That's a modest sized facility in an industrial park. What comes out is metal ready to be formed into magnets. That completes the supply chain.Owning the whole supply chain insulates MP Minerals from trouble in the middle stages. Such as China's 2024 ban on export of rare earth processing technology.[1] Now that they have the whole supply chain working, they can increase production if desired. It's much easier to duplicate a plant than make a new one for a new process.[1] https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-pr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it was a bad idea to let it stop happening in the US[1] in the first place? I have acquaintances who told me about this more than a decade ago. We thought it was stupid to let the production lines go then... and obviously, we were right.[1] https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/04/07/the-saga-of-magneque...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time and time again we see the US moving production of some key product or material overseas only to regret that decision a number of years later. It happens over and over again.Market forces are great, but should be ignored in key sectors that are important for national security. That goes for rare earth minerals or shipbuilding or key supplies for munitions or PPE that we needed during the pandemic, (etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991558</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there is a 3rd mode "I know exactly what I want, I just need this thing to autocomplete 90%+ of it in one shot so I don't have to type it all". Like when you're building out a class and you know it needs to have certain variations of constructor, certain types, certain public and private methods, certain ways to iterated and deep copy, certain ways to pretty print and  build up the plumbing to tie those to the default printing methods of the language, and so on.It's not really the "I don't care" mode as you care very much it matches specifically what you want to build out rather than "something which seems to work as a class if I paste it in".  It's also not really "I want to learn something here" as you already know exactly what you want and you're not looking for it to deviate, you're just looking to have it appear a couple times faster than if you typed it out. This is, more or less, "I want faster autocomplete for this task" usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last time I asked AI something, it started its response with "Yes, it's certainly possible to x with y." and closed its response with "in conclusion, unfortunately, it's not possible to x with y". In the same session, it told me one must press shift to get the number 1. I'm simultaneously amazed at its ability to generate what it can and disappointed at how it falls short so routinely. It'll get there eventually I'm sure, but I'm pretty dubious when people say they get a lot of value out of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me, the problem always seemed like people who use ChatGPT and alike default into the "I don't care" mode, and copy-paste blindly.Personally I think this is the root cause of most sloppy AI code. If you just look at the code that was generated, and you don't think "I would've come up with that", then probably the code is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42993490</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome. It’s great what is becoming possible in healthcare when you can keep asking questions until you’re no longer confused, and keep feeding data in, more than any overworked doctor could handle.It won’t always be correct, and needs all the right disclaimers.A friend of mine whose father is sadly very ill, made use of ChatGPT to interpret the oncology reports written about his dad. It helped him have deep technical conversations with multiple specialists and advocate for his dad, culminating in his advocacy for a treatment - that none of the specialists had thought of - which proved critical in extending his dad’s life. Now my buddy can chat to specialists in their own language and hands the info to ChatGPT to turn into layman’s terms for his dad - all of which my friend can check over for accuracy so he knows his dad is getting correct non-technical explanations.That is massive empowerment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To everyone here being dismissive of AI: you have no idea how it feels like to know you have something wrong, but receiving nothing but shrugs from the experts that are supposed to help you. I have experienced the very same thing: an orthopedist looked at my joint and wrist pain, the endocrinologist checked hormones, the rheumatologist ran their own tests. If I had to rely on my primary doctor to help, I would be taking ibuprofen and some other anti-inflammatory of their favorite big pharma.I did a large amount of tests, including RSI and carpal tunnel, chasing what could be the source of my issue. I was only able to find out that I have Ankylosing spondylitis by talking to other people online, and asking my primary care doctor to test me specifically for the HLA-B27 antigen. I was just lucky to receive help from a random person on the internet: "why don't you check for X".I imagine all the other people out there that were not lucky as me, or did not have access to that information. If AI can help with this, then it is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$100K 30 doctor visits, no answers, sounds like my experience with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (hEDS), perhaps I missed it but did not see what the final diagnosis was. Autoimmune could be a lot of things.If I feed in my symptoms today into AI, the same list I gave to doctors, I do get hEDS and specifically I get TNXB as a candidate gene. I don't include my WGS DNA data which came after I stoped bothering with doctors. AFAIK only specialists will diagnose hEDS and AFAIK absolutely none would predict TNXB. They call it clEDS instead and consider it 1 in a million, only if you have a specific TNXB SNP and it’s homozygous. Where I think most of hEDS is caused by presumed benign TNXB SNPs. Even the studies that specifically search for DNA candidates for hEDS skip over TNXB due to the belief that hEDS is rare and TNXB SNPs are common.So I don’t know where AI it’s getting its info from but the TNXB theory is mostly a patient led theory held by some of us who have it. There are some fringe giftedness researchers who focus on the RCCX gene cluster - which incidentally cause a ton of autoimmune conditions.So it’s definitely a situation where I think the answers from AI are far better than from doctors - I would have found out decades sooner. hEDS is such a perfect match for my symptoms that it becomes obviously true once I researched it so even if the AI guessed wrong it wouldn’t be worse than all of the doctors who guessed wrong. One even told me I should have thyroid surgery, thankfully I had already lost faith in them by that stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999632</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Generative Adversarial Networks" presents a novel framework for training generative models through adversarial techniques. It introduces two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other, where the generator aims to produce realistic data samples, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated samples. The paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, its potential applications in various fields, and showcases empirical results that demonstrate its effectiveness in generating high-quality outputs, paving the way for future research and advancements in generative modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the benefits of using thinking tokens compared to “thinking in a latent” space is that you can directly observe the quality of the CoT. In R1 they saw it was mixing languages and fixed it with cold start data.It would be hard to SFT this because you can only SFT the final result not the latent space.I also notice the authors only had compute for a single full training run. It’s impressive they saw such good results from that, but I wonder if they could get better results by incorporating recent efficiency improvements.I would personally not use this architecture because 1) it adds a lot of hyperparameters which don’t have a strong theoretical grounding and 2) it’s not clearly better than simpler methods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My opinion is that opaque reasoning is a prerequisite for many of the worst possible AI outcomes.We should make reasoning fully visible in the output space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Latent / embedding-space reasoning seems a step in the right direction, but building recurrence into the model while still relying on gradient descent (i.e. BPTT) to train it seems to create more of a problem (training inefficiency) than it solves, especially since they still end up externally specifying the number of recurrent iterations (r=4, 8, etc) for a given inference. Ideally having recurrence internal to the model would allow the model itself to decide how long to iterate for before outputting anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43004416</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a talk scheduled for FOSDEM 2025 titled "The State of Rust: Trying to Catch Up with Ada." It will explore the current status and advancements of the Rust programming language, focusing on how it seeks to adopt features and practices from Ada, particularly in the context of safety and reliability. The session aims to highlight the challenges faced by Rust in achieving similar benchmarks as Ada, an established language known for its strong typing and safety features. Attendees can expect insights into the ongoing developments in Rust and its trajectory moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't watch the video but I read the pdf transcript.  I noticed that the contract example (if x &gt; 50 then x+50 &gt; 100) can fail because of integer overflow.  This is an area that Ada seems to take much more seriously than Rust does.Anyone know what happened with Adacore and Ferrocene?  Are they no longer working together?  It sounded like a good collaboration earlier on, given the Rust juggernaut.Also I notice no mention of anything like SPARK for Rust.I still feel like Rust and Ada are designed for differing domains.  The archetypal Ada app in particular might malloc some memory (and possibly fail) during an initialization phase, but post-initialization, must never fail, which for among other things basically says never use malloc.  The post initialization part is basically a control loop using those fixed buffers to keep a jet engine spinning or whatever.Rust's archetype application on the other hand is a web browser: tons of dynamic allocation, possible memory exhaustion depending on what the user tries to do, and the requirement is to never fail ungracefully, as opposed to never failing at all.  "Never fail at all" is not exactly more stringent or complicated: it just means you're not allowed to even attempt certain things, because they might fail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh! It's about Pattern Types!I want Pattern Types for an entirely selfish reason, I want to write BalancedI8 and similar types -- as user defined types, but in stable Rust and have them Just Work™.BalancedI8 is similar to i8 (an 8-bit signed integer) and to NonZeroI8 (the same type but, with a niche where zero should be), instead of removing zero, which we often have a use for, lets remove the annoying most negative value i8::MINWhy "BalancedI8"? Because now that we've removed this most negative number (to provide a niche) the remaining value is symmetrical, it goes from -127 to +127Now, I profess that I want these types but I clearly don't want them enough to do very much about it, so that's not great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm seeing a lot more Ada posts on the front page recently. Was there a big investment in Ada recently or an acquisition where its marketing machinery is starting to chug along? Or was there a meaningful release or something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42998061</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of large canyons on the far side of the Moon, which researchers believe were formed by tectonic activity and possibly volcanic processes. These canyons, referred to as lunar grand canyons, are significantly larger than those on Earth and provide insights into the Moon's geological history. The study enhances our understanding of the Moon's evolution and the forces that shaped its surface. The findings are considered crucial for future lunar exploration and may help in locating resources for potential manned missions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;And there is so much still to uncover.  Just the other day I was going through  Neanderthal DNA during lunch and noticed that three of the four existing DNA samples show that they were carriers for the rs6467 form of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency.Neanderthals were highly inbred and had low population numbers.  Being a carrier of this form of CAH would have absolutely kept the population numbers low all by itself as getting two copies would have been nonviable. Further Neanderthals are most known for contributing to human specific DNA sets such as improved immune system.  Here we have something that even in the non classic form is havoc with the HPA-Axis and give incredible evolutionary pressure to resolve, one way is to simply dramatically improve the immune system.As far as I can tell this hasn't been written about before.  Lots of stuff like this will be noticed and or figured out in the decades ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Razib Khan did an excellent write-up about the latest research on this:https://www.razibkhan.com/p/current-status-its-complicated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To anyone that has a intrest in this area, (which if you are reading this you proably have some) I would highly reccomend the book Fossil Men by Kermit Pattison.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various architectural patterns for building real-time applications, focusing on how to efficiently manage data flow and user interactions. It highlights three main patterns: the Event Sourcing pattern, which records state changes as a series of events; the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern, separating read and write operations to optimize performance; and the Publish-Subscribe pattern, facilitating communication between components through a message broker. The piece emphasizes the importance of scalability, fault tolerance, and responsiveness in real-time systems while providing practical examples and considerations for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

Or even just "duplex" ?"realtime" has a long history in the computing and technology realms, and this ain't it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s amazing how much boilerplate stuff you don’t have to worry about when you use Phoenix LiveView.  I think I’m in love with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm building a simple version with horizontally scalable app servers that each use LISTEN/NOTIFY on the database. The article says this will lead to problems and you'll need PubSub services, but I was hoping LISTEN/NOTIFY would easily scale to hundreds of concurrent users. Please let me know if that won't work ;)Some context: The use case is a digital whiteboard like Miro and the heaviest realtime functionality will be tracking all of the pointers of all the users updating 5x per second. I'm not expecting thousands/millions of users as I'm planning on running each instance of the software on-prem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43004334</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a research paper on a novel use (or so I thought) of Linear Programming for how to optimize selection of cloud resources. The feedback I received was that application of LP in a newish area is not publishable and does not cover new ground. So don't write research papers about a new application of LP. It still covers the known and common cases of LP. No new ground to cover here.Knowing that and thinking about it more a couple years later, what the author seems to be describing is akin to BDD approach to LP model generation as an intermediary language before you get to the actual LP model. In this case, that approach is overshadowed by the use of LLMs.Use of LLMs to generate English language is no longer novel nor new. Therefore, any application of LLMs that do that aren't novel either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article entitled "Explainable Linear Programs" doesn't explain a linear program, nor link to an explained linear program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No offense to the author, but there's a wealth of research (and tools) out there on this subject - robust optimization, stable theory, etc. (not requiring LLMs and ML buzzwords)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42976244</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses why commercial air travel has not increased in speed since the 1960s, despite advancements in technology and engineering. It explains that while aircraft design has improved in efficiency and safety, the prevailing economic and regulatory environments hinder the introduction of faster planes. Factors such as the high costs of developing new technologies, the limited market for supersonic travel, and the impact of noise regulations are cited as significant barriers. Additionally, airlines prioritize operational efficiency and customer experience over speed, leading to a focus on maintaining existing aircraft rather than pursuing faster alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a similar phenomenon in ocean shipping called Slow Steaming.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_steamingFirst, the hull shapes of container ships are tuned for a particular cruising speed. They accelerate up to that speed and cruise across the Pacific. In particular, the ship's bulbous bow is shaped to create an efficient counter bow wave at that speed.Before 2007, that cruising speed was faster, maybe 27 knots. This is just like the 707 doing 525 knots in the article. It was faster but not efficient.Enter Slow Steaming. They redesigned the hulls for a lower cruising speed, maybe 18 knots. They actually took ships into dry dock and re-nosed them. The result was better fuel economy. Fewer shippers (some still are) were willing to pay extra for the 27 knot speed. With Slow Steaming, the results are lower costs and significantly less pollution.The economics of flying and shipping are largely the same in this case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flights feel like they’ve gotten much slower, in user space time.I remember as a kid in the 90s you could do a little metal detector, and sometimes not even that, and get on a plane.The changes to cockpit doors solves the 9/11 problem. Other than that guy who lit his underwear on fire one Christmas, I don’t know what exactly all of this is pretending to prevent.The TSA’s own internal tests have people getting handguns through.I have pre-check. Maybe eventually everyone will have it and the vast majority of passengers won’t have to take off shoes or take out laptops. Then we’ll get back to where we were decades ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So speed alone isn’t enough. And now we have noise restrictions, emissions rules and lack of infrastructure for supersonic flights. And I think commercial air travel will likely keep optimizing for efficiency rather than speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43000275</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article compares Ada's memory safety features with those of Rust, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of both programming languages. It discusses how Ada provides strong typing and data encapsulation to prevent common memory-related errors, while Rust employs ownership and borrowing mechanisms to ensure memory safety without a garbage collector. The author examines various aspects such as performance, ease of use, and safety guarantees, ultimately focusing on how each language addresses the challenges of building robust software in critical and safety-sensitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting and timely especially since I see the following so often:&gt; Why wouldn’t the Linux kernel team choose Ada instead of Rust?To which I say: Ada doesn't have a large user base beyond DOD projects.  Virtually no greenfield projects except for DOD.  Whereas there has been a Cambrian explosion of Unix kernels/tools/servers written in Rust.More generally, these questions of the form "Why are you ignoring X?" where X is Ada or Zig or C++ are really "Why didn't you write/don't you rewrite this in Rust?" by a different name.And my/that answer goes both ways.  Notably, Roc recently has stated it is moving away from Rust.  Ghostty uses Zig because Mitchell Hashimoto doesn't like Rust.  But the answer is always someone has to show up and do the work, usually because they like doing the work in some language.So -- it's okay to like the project strictly because of the language chosen.  That being said -- I'm super interested in the more technical differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you very much!I have been attempting to compare Ada and Rust for a while, but never got around to doing it quite so much in depth.So, my take on this is that:- out of the box, Rust is distinctly better at memory safety than Ada without SPARK- Ada + SPARK is extremely powerful (but iirc, SPARK doesn't allow compositional reasoning, which makes it harder to use in a crate-based library)- for this specific use case, Rust's error model makes much more sense than Ada's (with or without SPARK)- Ada's tooling to avoid memory allocation remain more powerful in some dimensions than Rust's.Also, I think that we all (should) agree that the move towards memory safety in system-level programming is a very good thing, whether it comes through Rust, Ada, or any other language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Directly using Unchecked_Deallocation is frowned upon, either use ControlledTypes (which the article mentions), or Bound/Unbounded Collections (which the article misses).Using it directly is similar to the usual discussion of using unsafe in Rust for double linked lists.As of Ada 202x, SPARK covers most of the language, no longer a subset, and also does affine types, aka borrow checking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42996831</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article offers an in-depth exploration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, explaining their underlying technology, capabilities, and limitations. It discusses how these models are trained on vast amounts of text data, which enables them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. The piece also addresses concerns around biases, ethical considerations, and the potential impact of LLMs on various industries. Additionally, it highlights the importance of understanding their functioning to harness their benefits responsibly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OT: What is a good place to discuss the original video -- once it has dropped out of the HN front-page?I am going through the video myself -- roughly halfway through -- and have a fw things to bring up.Here they are now that we have a fresh opportunity to discuss:1 - MATH and LLMsI am curious why many of the examples Andrej chose to pose to the LLM were "computational" questions -- for instance "what is 2+2" or some numerical puzzles that needed algebraic thinking and then some addition/subtraction/multiplication (example at 1:50 mins about buying Apples and Oranges).I can understand these abilities of LLMs are becoming powerful and useful too -- but in my mind these are not the "basic" abilities of a next token predictor.I would have appreciated a more clear distinction of prompts that showcase core LLM ability -- to generate text that is acceptable as generally grammatically correct, based in facts and context, without necessarily needing the ability of a working memory / assigning values to algebraic variables / doing arithmetic etc.If there are any good references to discussion on the mathematical abilities of LLMs and the wisdom of trying to make them do math -- versus simply recognizing when a math is needed and generating the necessary python/expressions and let the tools handle it.2 - METAWhile Andrej briefly acknowledges the "meta" situation where LLMs are being used to create training data for the training of and judge the outputs of newer LLMs ... there is not much discussion on that here.There are just many more examples of how LLMs are used to prepare mitigations for hallucinations by preparing Q&amp;A training sets with "correct" answers etcI am curious to know more about the limitations / perils of using LLMs to train/evaluate other LLMs.I kind of feel that this is a bit like the Manhattan project and atomic weapons -- in that early results and advances are being looped back immediately into the development of  more powerful technology. (A smaller fission charge at the core of a larger fusion weapon -- to be very loose with analogies)&lt;I am sure I will have a few more questions as I go through the rets of the video and digest it&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find Meta’s approach to hallucinations delightfully counter intuitive. Basically they (and presumably OpenAI and others):   - Extract a snippet of training data.
   - Generate a factual question about it using Llama 3.
   - Have Llama 3 generate an answer.
   - Score the response against the original data.
   - If incorrect, train the model to recognize and refuse incorrect responses.

In a way this is obvious in hindsight, but it goes against ML engineers natural tendency when detecting a wrong answer: Teaching the model the right answer.Instead of teaching the model to recognize what it doesn't know, why not teach it using those same examples? Of course the idea is to "connect the unused uncertainty neuron", which makes sense for out-of-context generalization. But we can at least appreciate why this wasn't an obvious thing to do for generation 1 LLMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andrej's video is great but the explanation on the RL part is a bit vague to me. How exactly do we train on the right answers? Do we collect the reasoning traces and train on them like supervised learning or do we compute some scores and use them as a loss function ? Isn't the reward then very sparse? What if LLMs can't generate any right answers cause the problems are too hard?Also how can the training of LLMs be parallelized when updating parameters are sequential? Sure we can train on several samples simultaneously, but the parameter updates are with respect to the first step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42997340</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study reveals that CAPTCHA systems, often used to verify human users online, function as a form of tracking and data collection, effectively operating as a "cookie farm" for profit. The study claims that users have collectively spent approximately 819 billion hours solving CAPTCHAs, generating nearly $1 trillion for Google. It critiques the system for being more about profit generation than actual security, highlighting concerns over privacy and the deceptive nature of these verification methods.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll spend my money elsewhere or find an alternative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google addressed the claims in this paper last year, and one of the authors challenged the company's responses.
See:
https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/24/googles_recaptchav2_l...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "cookie farm for profit" point is worth elaborating on. From the original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10911 :&gt;  More concretely, the current average value life-time of a cookie is €2.52 or $2.7 [58]. Given that there have been at least 329 billion reCAPTCHAv2 sessions, which created tracking cookies, that would put the estimated value of those cookies at $888 billion dollars.The cited paper is https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016781162... - but it doesn't deal with CAPTCHAs, just with the general economics of third-party cookies.In practice, many of these cookies will have already been placed by other Google services on the site in question, with how ubiquitous Google's ad and analytics products are. And it's unclear whether Google uses the _GRECAPTCHA cookies for purposes other than the CAPTCHA itself (in the places where this isn't regulated).But reCAPTCHA does gives Google an ability to have scripts running that fundamentally can't be ad-blocked without breaking site functionality, and it's an effective foot in the door if Google ever wanted to use it more broadly. It's absolutely something to be aware of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43002440</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Germany on a south-facing balcony, producing your own electricity from solar panels is cheaper than the transmission costs of the power company. Meaning that even if the power company somehow had a too-cheap-to-meter fusion power plant, getting that electricity to you is more expensive than you making your own solar power.Part of this is that transmission costs are higher in Germany than e.g. in the US, partially because Germany has a much more robust system with far fewer outages. How to structure these costs will likely become a bigger topic as more people produce their own electricity but still expect the grid to be there when they need it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been looking into doing this on my balcony in Spain. They sell “plug in” solar kits, but I’ve yet to determine if it’s actually legal here. I have a south facing balcony that’s about 1mx3m, so should be able to get about 400-600 watts of panels on the railing.I actually came across this article in my research and it’s the only thing I’ve found saying it’s legal if it’s under 800w.
 From what I’m gather it’s just a few solar panels and an inverter that feeds electricity into a socket, more or less.
My concern is what happens when there’s a power outage? I’d then be feeding power into a system that’s “denergized”. I know with real solar setups there’s an automatic cutoff when that happens to protect people working on the lines…all the kits i see here mention nothing about a cutoff system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish we could remove the 100% tariffs on solar panels and EVs from China and let the free market do its thing. It feels like lobbying and red tape are the biggest things holding back the energy transition at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42970847</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It boils down to building big surface area mirror cheap enough. Once you prove there is business demand, and you have your cheap Mylar satellites working, you scale your system up with better technology.Of course they don't reveal their neat trick now because from a strategic point of view it would be bad, because other people would copy them, and probably outpace them.Once it's only a physics problem, it becomes quite easy. Here are two potential solutions to the physics problem : Liquid mirrors, and plasma mirrors. The easiest being the liquid mirrors so let's explain this one. In fact it's so easy, it's child play.Have your kids ever played with soap bubble : It's the same thing but in space. You make a big ring (roughly of the same area of the spot you are trying to make on the ground) (thin circular wire that you fold so that it will unfold itself like these tents) and you flow liquid metal (like mercury) on top to form a thin layer, hold by surface tension (and eventually electric field to have finer control of the shape or the surface).The mirror will be a few atoms thick, a design that must be fabricated in space directly. It's just that we are not used to thinking with low force zero gravity environment. You don't use motors to move your mirror, you use fields spawned from precisely positioned points (and you have to compensate for solar winds).Of course there are still technological problems due to the harsh conditions of space, but it's not something unheard of : https://engr.ncsu.edu/news/2024/03/06/reflecting-the-future-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YT video going into the math and physics involved: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkjyeI0ykGMTL;DW: not practical in it's current design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious to know the effects of beaming additional solar energy to Earth on climate change. I can’t imagine it’d be good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42995403</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article shares a personal narrative of an individual's experience with purchasing a Tesla Model 3, highlighting the excitement and anticipation surrounding the car. However, it quickly transitions into a critique of the challenges faced after the purchase, including issues with customer service, software glitches, and overall dissatisfaction with the vehicle's performance. The author expresses frustration over the contrast between Tesla's marketing promises and the reality of ownership, ultimately leading to a feeling of regret regarding the decision to buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had similar experiences with a modern Volvo. (XC40 T8 EV). Modern cars seem to be absolutely terrible.It's like all those Single Page Applications on the web that are just downgrades over the classic Server-Side Rendered apps. Sure, you have more features, but at what cost? Reliability.I think the last generations of cars before the touch buttons and screens were the last "okay" generation. Somewhere in 2010s, all cars were converted to be "smart cars", and they are all terrible. Who walks into a BMW dealer and sits down, surrounded by how many displays, and think: Wow! That's neat! And then you go to drive and it just notifications, beeps and boops.I just want a luxury car that is grand, silent, feels nice, is nice to drive, and doesn't blast my eyes with screens.I once connected my Volvo to pull a trailer. First, it reminds me to update the software. I click it away. It then gave me 2 notifications about some assist features not working and rear warning not working or something, idk. It also occasionally reminded the child locks are enabled, which I do not need reminders about. Then it is cold, so you get a cold weather warning. And then the windows are a bit wet because I didn't clear the camera properly from ice, so you get a warning about the cruise control not working. So 10 minutes in, I had received 6 notifications from my CAR! I didn't even use cruise control, I just wanted to pull my trailer a short distance. And some of these notifications block the navigation and require interaction to close. While driving!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have owned Model S since 2018, now driving my second one (Raven).
The first one was just poor manufacturing Tesla has been known for forever.
Second one is however the disaster. So many sounds while turning the steering wheel, driving on tiny slopes, braking etc. forced me to convince the service center to replace the suspension, arms &amp; half-shafts (all under warranty). None of these steps helped, service center proposed to try another service center "where there may have more experience" and called the squeaking the feature of the vehicle. 
I visited 3rd party garage, got more information about possible sources and concluded it is probably impossible to fix it.
So here I am, driving the $80k car that squeaks like 30 years old rusty Ford, attracting attention at the parking lots.
Won't be buying a next one for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let's remove Musk from the equation, because you can like or (most probably) hate him, but I own a Tesla and I have the opposite experience. Everything worked out of the box. Just one piece of hardware started to fail (the charger plug making some noise) and they changed it in warranty.First: has the author tried a tesla before buying one? I'd never buy a car without trying it. Because comparing it to a Clio just because the Clio worked, well, seems a bit off. a Clio is a car, a fully functional Tesla is a gian iPad with wheels. There's a huge difference.Second: when you buy a car, do you ask yourself, how will I fix it in case anything goes wrong? Buying a car in a country where there's no service is a huge no-no.Third: No doubt that a car with all these defects _must_ be changed, or fixed immediately at no cost of transportation, or offered a compensation to get it back. I think the owner should _also_ contact a lawyer and try to get a refund. I'd not accept this kind of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42998024</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;Perma.cc is a digital archiving service designed to help users create permanent links to online materials, ensuring that references remain accessible even if the original content is altered or removed. It is particularly beneficial for academics, researchers, and lawyers who require reliable citations in their work. The platform allows users to save web pages and generate links that point to the archived versions, effectively preserving the integrity of online information for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42972622"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! Perma is made by the Harvard Library Innovation Lab, which I direct, and I wrote a bunch of the early code for it back in 2015 or so.For HN readers, I'd suggest checking out https://tools.perma.cc/, where we post a bunch of the open source work that backs this. Due to the shift from warc to wacz, (a zipped-web-archive format developed by WebRecorder), it's now possible to pass around fully interactive high fidelity web archives as simple files and host them with client side javascript, which opens up a bunch of new possibilities for web archive designs. You can see some tech demos of that at our page https://warcembed-demo.lil.tools/ , where each page is just a static file on the server and some client side javascript.It's best to think of Perma.cc itself, the service, as some UX and user support wrapping to help solve linkrot primarily in the law journal, courts, law journals, and journalists area (for example, dashboards for a law journal to collaborate on the links they're archiving for their authors), and our work on this as building from that usecase to try to make it easier for everyone to build similar things.I saw some mentions of the Internet Archive, which is great, and is also kind enough to keep a copy of our archives and expose them through the Wayback Machine. One thing I've been thinking about recently in archiving is that there's a risk to overstandardizing -- you don't want things too much captured with the same software platforms, funded through the same models, governed by the same people, exposed through the same interfaces, etc. There's supposed to be thousands of libraries, not one library. Unlike "don't roll your own crypto," I'd honestly love to see more people roll their own archives.Happy to answer any questions!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heads up that the .cc TLD is frequently used for malicious purposes and will likely get blocked by a lot of networks.When I've worked on spam prevention in the past, that TLD always comes up disproportionately often. I've never personally built a filter that blocks the entire TLD, but I'm sure from looking at the data that people with stricter compliance requirements have.The Anti-Phishing Working Group ranked the TLD the second-worst in the ratio of phishing domains to total registrations, with the highest total volume of phishing (page 13):https://docs.apwg.org//reports/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prospective users are understandably concerned that perma.cc will go out of business. No institution can guarantee that it will exist in perpetuity. But perma.cc has at least published a contingency plan: https://perma.cc/contingency-plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42972622</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Don't Be Frupid" emphasizes the importance of making wise financial decisions and avoiding impulsive spending behaviors. It discusses the concept of "frupidity," which refers to the act of being foolish with money, and encourages readers to adopt a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to their finances. The piece offers practical tips for budgeting, saving, and investing, urging individuals to prioritize long-term financial health over short-term gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like I could sum up this article as "give engineers everything they want, they're expensive!"TBH, I hate articles like this, not because I disagree with the general thesis, but because they present things in a way that is so one-sided that it is either ignorant or willfully blind to the other side of the equation.Yes, I wholeheartedly agree that cost cutting or being stingy with resources can be counterproductive. But if you look at some of the top examples the article gives, nearly every one can have a flip side:1."Tool penny pinching" - totally agree, having a good set of tools for engineers is critically important. At the same time, I've seen companies do an audit where they found lots of expensive SaaS products got little use or were not worth it. It's fair to say that individual tools should have to justify their costs in terms of productivity improvements or time savings.2. Hardware savings - Unlike this article, I recall reading another good example of a midsize software company I believe where the engineers were just able to make a case that better hardware would save x hours per developer per year. It was an easy argument to management so they upgraded. That's much better than "We want the fastest laptop, just trust us!"3. "Infrastructure Sabotage" - this is the one that I think annoyed me the most, because I've seen cloud costs explode where hardly anyone had a good grasp on where that money was going.Yes, there is a reason "penny wise and pound foolish" is a well known saying. But this article is just heavy on the feels without ever making good, analytical arguments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Conference Austerity
&gt; Conferences get nuked because someone upstairs sees them as a “nice to have.” The irony? That conference could’ve been where your engineers learned about a new technique that would’ve saved you a million bucks in infrastructure costs. Instead, they’re stuck reinventing the wheel – badly.I agree with the thesis in general but this point is not resonating strongly with me.Conferences are expensive.AWS reinvent for example requires you to spend 2000 dollars on a conference ticket and travel to Las Vegas and pay for expensive hotels etc.Most of the content from the sessions and talks there is posted online on YouTube ... in recent memory they posted them online within a day (full credit to them).The added benefit of attending conferences in person is very hard to justify IMO. Yes there is networking and yes there are some hands on workshops etc.Instead of the justification offered in the blog post ... I would say, sponsoring your employees' visits to conferences shows that you treat them well, care about their personal learning and growth, and inturn motivates them to look for synergies between their interests and work. They might end up learning that technique from a free youtube video anyway, but only the motivated ones care about applying it at work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a large company in my city that had around 30 floors of staff and a dedicated full time contractor managing the expensive coffee machines on each floor (running dishwashers, restocking beans/milk, cleaning/servicing the machines etc). Management decided to do away with this role and get rid of the coffee machines to save 1 Full time salary + change.The next week there were 40 staff queuing for coffee at every cafe within a 10 minute walk. Coffee breaks went from 3-4 minutes (walk to kitchen on your floor, press 'latte', walk to desk) to a minimum of 45 minutes (elevator to ground floor, walk to cafe, queue with everyone else, wait with everyone else, elevator back up). These were staff on high six figure salaries.Definitely the Frupidiest decision I have ever seen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42996796</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide on how to create a simple thank-you page using Bootstrap, a responsive front-end framework. It details the steps to set up the HTML structure and includes examples of customizing the design with Bootstrap classes. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of user experience and aesthetics, offering tips on how to enhance the page layout and functionality. The end goal is to help users create a visually appealing thank-you page efficiently by utilizing Bootstrap's features.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something that I've often wished, as a primarily backend focused engineer, often without frontend support, is for designers or perhaps design engineers, to pretty much build Bootstrap themes. That would let me code to the Bootstrap docs (which are pretty good), while allowing us to brand or customise whatever we're working on. I've seen even contract designers push back on this idea, suggesting that doing such a thing is beneath them, and I've heard frontend engineers push back on using Bootstrap as the framework.This has always struck me as odd. From my, admittedly naive, point of view, Bootstrap seems to be a reasonable framework for customisation. I've done this myself in personal projects. It just doesn't seem like others see it as a design system framework in that way. Few teams have capacity to develop their own design systems, but a Bootstrap theme seems to be most of the benefits with not a lot of effort. That said, I've never been particularly enthused with third party Bootstrap themes, they seem to have too much custom work and lock-in.What am I missing? I've not used Tailwind, but it seems like perhaps the goal of Tailwind is to do something similar?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I clicked this totally expecting this to be somebody still using Bootstrap Version 1.0 haha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can recommend halfmoon css for a visually pleasing nice drop in replacement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42995579</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a detailed overview of ricotta cheese, including its origins, production process, and culinary uses. It highlights the versatility of ricotta, showcasing various recipes and serving suggestions, while also discussing the nutritional benefits of the cheese.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried a little Japanese (the second language I know best).  Not sure where the content comes from but the translations were wrong, the vocabulary was strange, and otherwise the cards did not work out for me.  Seems like they were auto generated via AI or google translate or something, in any case they were not accurate or natural sounding.  Maybe other languages are better but I wouldn't know enough to tell.Anki is one of my favorite pieces of software ever so I was definitely willing to try yours.  Seems like the feature that defines your app is auto-generation of a card / set of cards.  Didn't see any way to create your own card, all you can do is put in an English word and get the automatically generated card added to your deck.  So if that's not working well the entire thing crumbles.Interesting idea that might have a future if it finds significant improvement.  I think if it was ironed out I would still prefer it to spit out an anki compatible deck that I can use in Anki itself instead of in the ricotta web app.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Things the webpage should answer:- If it's free, like you say here, that it's free.- What languages does it work for?- What's the process to start?Things I'm curious about:- Is this intended to be a business?  How do we get surprised by this costing something or disappearing in the future?- Can it work in the opposite direction, e.g. to help students that speak Chinese pick up targeted English vocabulary based on what they're working on?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd have to see some serious stats to believe whatever SRS algorithm you use is better than FSRS (which is supported in Anki).Stats for FSRS here (and elsewhere) [0].[0] https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/18csuer/fsrs_is_now_t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42966942</guid></item><item><title>37.

Ultimately, investors mainly care about the returns and if you can get better returns elsewhere due to these fees, they will switch.If they can charge large amount of fees and still stay competitive, then good on them, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow news day Bloomberg? Seriously, if you're investing in ANYTHING, and don't understand the prospectus or won't hire people to understand it for you, you're a fool.They can charge whatever they want on these "pass-throughs".The industry, just like post-return-management-clawbacks in the Tiger era (see Mallaby's "More Money Than God" https://amzn.com/dp/B003SNJZ3Y ) can get away with this precisely ONCE before "normalization" (as much as it's ever normalized) kicks in and these practices obviated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this post underestimates how the degree to which “what data is correct” is deeply contextual.My team created an identical hypothesis to this doc ~2 years ago and generated a proof of concept. It was pretty magic, we had fortune 500 execs asking for reports on internal metrics and they’d generate in a couple of minutes. First week we got rave reviews - followed by an immediate round of negative feedback as we realized that ~90% of the reports were deeply wrong.Why were they wrong? It had nothing to do with the LLMs per se, 03-mini doesn’t do much better on our suite than gpt 3.5. The problem was that knowing which data to use for which query was deeply contextual.Digging into use cases you’d fine that for a particular question you needed to not just get all the rows from a column, you needed to do some obscure JOIN ON operation. This fact was only known by 2 data scientists in charge of writing the report. This flavor or problem - data being messy, with the messiness only documented in a few people’s brains, repeated over and over.I still work on AI powered products and I don’t see even a little line of sight on this problem. Everyone’s data is immensely messy and likely to remain so. AI has introduced a number of tools to manage that mess, but so far it appears they’ll need to be exposed via fairly traditional UIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good read that is a great starting point for thinking about this. It essentially takes the extreme position - SaaS no longer needs a UI, because the LLM is the UI.In reality, as always, I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between. SaaS products that succeed will be those that have a good UI _and_ and good API that LLMs can use.An LLM is not always the best interface, particularly for data access. For most people, clicking a few times in the right places is preferable to having to type out (or even speak aloud) "Show me all the calls I did today", waiting for the result, having to follow up with "include the time per call and the expected deal value", etc etc.There is undoubtedly an opportunity for disruption here, but I think an LLM only SaaS platform is going to be a very tough sell for at least the next decade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look, I love LLMs and even implement them for customers, but I am very sceptical about them 'replacing' ERP and CRP systems. What some AI folks don't seem to understand is that traditional ERP and CRP apps are completely driven by auditable business rules because they have to be. If you're running a company, there's no discretion at all about how money and other assets and liabilities are accounted for. It all has to be strictly according to the rules. This goes for most everything else - management are responsible for the business rules implemented in the system and they need to be precisely spelled out. Sure, AI can and should be used extensively for the human UI piece of it. To simplify getting data into and out of the system for example. But the engine inside and the database are all strictly rule governed and I definitely dont expect that to change anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43004373</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and implications of climate change on global food security. It highlights how rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and shifting agricultural patterns threaten crop yields and food production systems. Experts emphasize the need for immediate action to adapt agricultural practices, implement sustainable methods, and ensure equitable access to food. The piece also points out the potential social and economic repercussions of failing to address these climate impacts, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts at local and global levels to mitigate risks and promote resilience in food systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The CNN article I just skimmed about this has a very interesting science communication issue. It notes that originally the solid inner core rotated faster than the rest of the planet, but that in 2010 it rotated slower than the rest of the planet. It's not clear from CNN's article:1. Whether the inner core was or was not observed to spin faster than the rest of the planet
2. Whether the inner core changed (relative?) speed in 2010 or whether its behavior was confirmed in 2010, or
3. Perhaps most interestingly, whether the inner core had spun faster than the rest of the planet and we happened to be alive at the time when, for the first time in our planet's 4.6 billion year history, that changed in 2010, or whether they swap rotation rates now and then.This is not really criticism. Science communication is hard. Hell, I've probably misrepresented CNN's representation 2-3 times in this comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The inner core is usually thought to be shaped like a ball, but its edges may actually have deformed by 100m or more in height in places, according to Prof John Vidale who led the research.Is this not within the margin of error for our understanding of the boundary?It would not surprise me if the boundary is a place where there is no clear difference between solid and liquid, such that the solid edges of the core are always transient. Phase change diagrams in chemistry show regions where matter is simultaneously a liquid and a solid at temperatures and pressures that do not occur in daily life. Presumably, under immense pressure and temperature, the core's boundary would be a place where this occurs.I am not an expert in physics, so take what I say here with a grain of salt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite an understatement:&gt; The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43002130</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Macostalgia" explores the nostalgia and sentimental value associated with classic Macintosh computers from the 1980s and 1990s. It showcases a project that captures the essence of this iconic technology through graphic design, highlighting its aesthetics, user experience, and cultural impact. The piece delves into memories associated with the Macintosh interface, its design features, and the influence it had on both personal computing and design as a whole, ultimately celebrating the enduring legacy of these vintage machines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get the nostalgia, but boy are computers so much better than back then.  MacOS 7-8 (not sure about 9, never used it) would crash constantly.  There was no protected memory, so as soon as one app started misbehaving, you'd have to reboot the computer and it would take forever and you'd lose your work.  My recollection was that this would typically happen 3-4 times a day.  Apple's project to make a new MacOS that didn't do this failed and so they had to buy NeXT, and the rest is history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s something about the Platinum UI that makes it timeless. I have been running XFCE with a Platinum theme on several of my machines/VMs for a while (https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2022/04/12/2330) and I’m a bit sad that the XFCE top-level app menu plugin seems to have been deprecated in recent releases, since it really adds to the experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All we ever needed was in Snow Leopard. Everything since then (ok except maybe for SIP and XProtect) is bloatware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990704</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of decentralizing iCloud services to enhance user control, privacy, and data security. It highlights the limitations of centralized cloud systems, such as data vulnerabilities and the risks of vendor lock-in. By proposing a decentralized approach, the author emphasizes the potential benefits of allowing users to manage and store their data across multiple, distributed nodes, thus reducing reliance on single entities and fostering greater trust and transparency in cloud computing. The piece advocates for a shift towards decentralized technologies to empower users and safeguard their digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple cares about profits, and only about users to the extent that it can profit from them. The touted security and privacy aspects of their service are useful for marketing, but they are not primarily why people buy Apple devices.They already operate in China, allowing the Chinese government to access all "Chinese" user data. Non-Chinese Apple accounts also work perfectly well in China, which leads me to believe that the extent of data sharing is greater than has been disclosed (or dissidents could just use a foreign phone to avoid surveillance). I strongly suspect the CIA/FBI/DHS has similar access.(Microsoft stuff also works fine in China, Google stuff does not. Draw your own conclusions.)I think it's somewhat likely they'll just backdoor it and not tell the public, they can see this is just the way the world is headed.If you want to message someone secretly, use an audited open source solution - don't rely on a megacorp to look out for your interests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest downside of Option 2 is stated as:&gt; Perhaps more importantly, this is also a strategically worrisome direction to go in, because it plays into the narrative that Big Tech is more powerful than sovereign nations.I don't buy it. I think it can be a fantastic win for them. Announce a leave date unless the government backs down and advertise it heavily on TV and everywhere:Your government wants us to spy on you. We are not going to comply. Call your parliament members to &lt;blah&gt;.This would make them champions of privacy and every other government will know how deep their commitment is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it would be suicidal for Apple to comply with that. It would open it to requests for many other countries demanding the same. Now this will create problems because now countries will start requiring Apple not to disclose their citizens information to any other party. Now you have two opposing requirements that will lead to Apple products to be banned in many countries if not all. I think Apple have much to lose by complying with UK that just withdraw and make UK users put pressure on their government.And it is not classical west vs east. I think this is on much more fundamental concept of sovereignty. Many countries on both sides of ideological spectrum invest a lot on hacking and zero days exploits to obtain information on specific targets. UK is too lazy and demanding this privacy violation and internationally illegal action (just guessing) to be routine request.edit: Fix typos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42997647</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another Ph.D. physicist here (Ivy, not Stanford/Berkeley)As others have pointed out, your prospective advisor(s) are the most important thing to consider. You can't go wrong with either school.That said, when choosing an advisor:* Pay attention to where the advisor's former students ended up. The former students are a natural "network" for you when you graduate. If you can, ask relatively recent grads about their experience.* Meet the prospective advisor's current students and post-docs - are they happy? Will you fit in with them? Do they graduate in a reasonable amount of time? Ask other grad students about the professor as well. Trust me, each professor is going to have a reputation.* If you want to stay in academia, mid-career advisors are the "safest" - an assistant prof may be working on something exciting, but the research will probably be more risky, and the professor might even have to leave mid-way through your thesis work if they don't get tenure. A late-career advisor may presently sit on a lot of committees and be more well-known, but by the time you need their recommendation for jobs/tenure they may have considerably less influence (that happened to me, although it was fine in the end.)Read Feibelman's "A PhD is not enough" - still lots of good advice even though written 30+ years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both programs are very good, the specific PI is going to be much much more important than any generic advice you glean from this thread. Separately, the environs are very different. Stanford is pristine, quiet, safe, boring, isolated, VC-oriented. Berkeley is urban, gritty, dense, exciting, outgoing, academic. For most people it doesn’t really matter but if it does for you this could be important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I received my PhD in applied physics and had colleagues, collaborators, and some published work in this (very broad) field. Although I'm familiar with the programs, my advice is not specific.The question you have to answer first is: why do you want a PhD? Is it to do science for as long as possible? Is it to contribute to the frontier of human knowledge? Is it to participate in an global research community? Is it to land a tenure track job? Or do you not know the questions and their answers (which is fine!)?I'll offer myself as a case study. I knew I wanted to make something tangible (hence device physics / photonics), I knew I wanted to explore the possibility of continuing in academia, and I knew that I would enjoy working in industry. I structured my PhD to go for a high risk/high reward research topic (with the thinking that if it pans out, academia would be viable without having to go through an extended PhD and multiple postdocs, which was off the table for me). I also set up to consult on industry projects, and started poking around the local startup incubators and B-school entrepreneurial offerings. My school (and PI) choice was motivated really by these factors: how I judged the impact of potential research being done by the team, how plugged-in and amenable was the environment to extracurricular work, and how supported I would be to a transition to start-ups/industry.Figure out what you want, and treat your PhD itself as an experiment w/ testable hypotheses. If you're not sure about something, how can you build into the experience a way to find out? Is it a class, a side-project, the local community that can help? There are many factors to take into account when choosing a school because we all weigh those factors differently - once you decide what's really important to you you'll get better-tuned advice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43000792</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ecological and cultural significance of the return of buffalo to their native habitats, particularly focusing on areas in North America. It highlights how the reintroduction of buffalo contributes to the restoration of grassland ecosystems, benefiting other species and enhancing biodiversity. Additionally, the article emphasizes the positive impacts on Indigenous communities, which view buffalo as a crucial part of their heritage and identity, and outlines the broader implications for land management and conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The necessity of vast herds of large ungulates have long been recognized as a critical part of the North American ecosystem. Either bison or cattle will demonstrably work. Regions that have largely been abandoned by cattle ranchers, whether due to economics, environmental destruction, or regulation, have been ecologically devastated in the absence of wild bison to fill the ecosystem gap. Bootstrapping new herds of bison in these areas will transform them in a positive way. In the Mountain West, the introduction of free range cattle in areas that were previously off-limits has had a similar effect.This is related to why eliminating beef agriculture in large parts of North America would have limited impact on ungulate methane emissions. Without replacing them with vast herds of bison, which similarly emit methane, the ecosystems die.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's absolutely amazing news. I've seen them (at a distance) in Yellowstone.The photo of the giant pile of bison skulls invokes such a feeling of pure doom. The fact that this happened not because the animals are a nuisance, but to eradicate the people who relied on them is... insane.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_hunting#19th-century_bis...As per the history books, only ~100 remained at the end. And what I cannot find a definitive answer on is: are the current bison (not the ones for meat) all descendants of those 100?I do wonder, apart from money, how can a sw engineer contribute to this restoration effort?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See the Buffalo Commons [1], one idea to allow a huge area (139000 mi^2) of the dry part of the Great Plains to return to its former prairie and allow free ranging bison.Rural decline can bring amazing opportunities.Tear down the fences to allow landscape connectivity, restore the American Serengeti. Allow sustainable wild bison harvest like the Alaskan fisheries model.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Commons

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the punchline, the USB floppy spec is actually incredibly restrictive and only supports 720K, 1.25MB and 1.44MB formatted capacities. This means, ironically for a spec partially written by a friend of Raymond Chen's, that you can't read the Microsoft 1.68MB DMF floppies used for software distribution with a USB floppy, but it also means that it's impossible to support the older 400K and 800K Mac formats. To be fair, those formats also require a special drive mechanism (the disk spins at different rates depending on which track you're reading), but there's no way to expose them within the USB floppy spec. There's an entirely justifiable argument for manufacturing a separate Mac drive with different functionality and requiring its own drivers.(Edit to fix capacity)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked at Best Buy in those days. EVERYTHING was translucent.But there were some problems. The accessory companies didn't match that Mac Bondi Blue very well. And they didn't match Blueberry, Lime, or Tangerine well either. So you'd have some weird color blue on your mouse, or gamepad, or external hard drive that didn't match up with your iMac.I seem to remember some of the "official" accessories being able to use the right colors, but back then it was such a free for all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do love having a full complement of matching translucent blue accessories (SuperDisk, PD/DVD-RAM drive, FireWire webcam shaped kinda like Orbb from QuakeⅢ with a human-foot-shaped metal stand, etc) to use with my “Blue &amp; White” G3 tower (PowerMac1,1), so it worked on me! :)Nine 2004-era comments now purged from Microsoft's current site: https://web.archive.org/web/20210125145431/http://bytepointe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43002426</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance and benefits of blogging using raw HTML instead of relying on content management systems or website builders. It emphasizes the flexibility and control that raw HTML provides, allowing bloggers to customize their content and design without limitations. The author shares practical tips on how to get started with HTML blogging, including using basic tags, structuring posts, and incorporating multimedia elements. The overall message encourages readers to embrace the simplicity and power of coding their blogs from scratch to enhance their creativity and technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is novice stuff.  I write my blog by modifying the filesystem's binary structure by hand with a hex editor. There is no Javascript or CSS whatsoever and the document uses only elements, attributes, and behaviours that were both described in the original HTML v1.1 DTD and that have continued to appear in every intervening IETF, W3C, and WHATWG issuance since then. Many of the elements are therefore deprecated and currently unimplemented in all evergreen browsers. Nevertheless I live in firm expectation of their eventual reinstatement. The HTTP service is one I nicked from a grad student in my CS department circa 1995, it speaks only HTTP/0.9, and is written in a mixture of ksh and dd, requiring no other utilities. This runs on a SPARCstation 20 from the same era that has been repaired from scavenged parts so many times that the hostname spontaneously updated to "theseus" a few years ago. Fun fact: impurities in the copper I smelted to replace the power supply windings led (as you can no doubt imagine) to induction spikes on the drive rails, and the subsequent fsck erased all blog entries mentioning Jonathan Schwartz. So nothing of value was lost. Readers may be pleased to learn that despite all this I'm not totally retro; since SunOS 4.x is now out of support, the Kodiak is proudly booting NetBSD.The blog itself is, of course, optimised for viewing in Lynx.  In fact it only works in Lynx&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the blog you’re reading now is written in raw HTML, with md-block for markdown, and highlight.js for syntax highlighting.That doesn't sound like raw HTML to me. I write my own blog in raw HTML with a text editor (BBEdit), no JavaScript, and no server-side script either.For good measure, I also write my RSS feed in raw XML with a text editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am curious. How is this raw HTML if you're using markdown?But on the other side, writing in raw HTML is a fascinating topic I've been very intrigued by. http://john.ankarstrom.se/html/ is a very inspiring post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42996322</guid></item><item><title>47.

Since 911 calling bypasses network locks, we'll have a world where everyone outdoors can reach help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting to see all the criticism of things like this on a place like hacker news.Starlink has repeatedly been pooh-poohed. It's impossible, it'll never work, no one will want to use it.If you have ever travelled internationally the potential game changing nature of Starlink would be immediately apparent.This is a test. If nothing else, spacex is known to iterate. Starlink satellites have intentionally low lifetimes in space, they are all going to be replaced relatively soon with later generations.Yes, Biden and the FCC successfully fought Starlink, they got the awards for rural connectivity revoked, and the appeal of the revocation also kept the award revoked because starlink supposedly couldn't provide rural connectivity. So at least on paper starlink has "failed" to meet the needs of rural folks.The FCC "concluded that Starlink had not shown that it was reasonably capable of fulfilling Rural Digital Opportunity Fund requirements to deploy a network of the scope, scale, and size required to serve the 642,925 model locations in 35 states for which it was the winning bidder."You'd sort of expect hacker news folks to be interested in the science of potential benefits of this sort of thing (even if they doubt it'll ever happen). T-Mobile is betting pretty clearly that starlink WILL be able to deliver messaging via a space based backhaul.And rumor has it that starlink is bringing in some real money even if the govt has determined its not technically feasible so there is some market validation of their ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/PPrgQ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42996003</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The below section resonates: lately YouTube has figured out I am in my mid-twenties and considering for the first time how best to save money for a secure/stable future.The number of ADs I see now not so subtly implying that I can expect to “lose big” or “rent forever” if I don’t subscribe to QuestTrade/WealthSimple/…It’s just frustrating to know that someone put time and thought into making me and a million other folks in my “demographic bucket” feel anxious and worried.I’m not sure how best to address this sort of thing and I suppose I can buy my way out of most internet ads if I want to so I acknowledge we all play a part in this market.But some types of advertisements need to be highly regulated I would include Gambling, Pharmaceuticals, Alcohol on that list. But a broader class of non-luxury goods which are being advertised via a very negative framing of the consumers current situation are a social externality. They contribute to real health problems in the population and in my view that is reason enough to examine regulation.&gt; A marketer I know has a mantra, that successful sales are all about dissatisfaction - making people aware just how their situation sucks, and then offering a way to relieve the pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first comment (now) quibbles about the definition of advertising.The second comment (now) quibbles about the use of the word cancer. (there is benign cancer).Advertising (whether it uses tracking or not) can be defined as the intention of convincing someone rather than providing information. Intent is to convince. PROPOGANDA.The intent is for the target/prey/victim to be unable to distinguish the truth value.So here we have a first problem. Is the intent of the first comment on HN"Most of the arguments .. are not about 'advertising' ..."made to help me understand the article better? Or are they made with the intent of causing to me doubt the article (or even not to read it).The same question can be asked about the second question. Ad infinitum and nauseaum.THAT is STAGE 1 social cancer. I can no longer trust the intention of posts on HN.STAGE 2 is that I can no longer trust the INTENTION of any media.Do I want a recipe for cookies? Use the "garrble" to search. Can I really believe that this recipe has ever been made by the person/bot/AI that created it?STAGE 3. Human societies and Communities are founded on trust. The ability to come to a common understanding of a situation and act collectively.  STAGE 3 is when communities and societies no longer function.The internet has STAGE 2 cancer and some STAGE 3. Since our society in the US depends on the internet ....Well you cannot trust anything I say, I could be an AI for all you know. And probably my definitions are wrong, my understanding of stages of cancer is faulty, etc.Here is my 2cents. The article vastly underestimates the damage and dangers, but is definitely worth a read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here I was perfectly happy with how things are. Alas, thanks to the advertisement now I've realized all the imperfections of my life that can only be remediated by the advertised products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999561</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article compares the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, two iconic gaming consoles from Atari. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each system, discussing factors such as graphics quality, game library, backward compatibility, and overall user experience. The Atari 2600 is noted for its pioneering role in the video game industry and a vast array of classic titles, while the Atari 7800 is praised for its superior graphics and built-in backward compatibility that allows it to play 2600 games. The piece aims to help readers decide which console might be the better choice for retro gaming enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

(These games are a lot easier to play when you don't have to wait for the on screen response.)The other thing is the original paddle controls are a lot more fun for games like Circus Atari or Night Driver than a gamepad.If you don't like the classic joystick, then between the Commodore and Atari extended line of joysticks, you can find a suitable alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alas, the 7800 had better graphics but was hobbled by keeping the original TIA sound chip from the 2600.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42962274</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;An undergraduate student, G. M. D. Pourzanjani, has upended a longstanding data science conjecture that has persisted for 40 years. This conjecture, concerning the effectiveness of a particular statistical method for analyzing data sets, has significant implications for how researchers approach data science and machine learning. Pourzanjani's work demonstrates that the traditional approach may not always hold true, prompting re-evaluation of existing methodologies and highlighting the potential for new insights in the field of data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Krapivin made this breakthrough by being unaware of Yao's conjecture.The developer of Balatro made an award winning deck builder game by not being aware of existing deck builders.I'm beginning to think that the best way to approach a problem is by either not being aware of or disregarding most of the similar efforts that came before. This makes me kind of sad, because the current world is so interconnected, that we rarely see such novelty with their tendency to "fall in the rut of thought" of those that came before. The internet is great, but it also homogenizes the world of thought, and that kind of sucks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok, big shout out to monort [0] for the link to the video [1].This is just a quick overview from a single viewing of the video, but it's called "funnel hashing". The idea is to split into exponentially smaller sub arrays, so the first chunk is n/m, the second is n/(m^2), etc. until you get down to a single element. Call them A0, A1, etc., so |A0| = n/m, |A1| = n/(m^2) etc., k levels in total.Try inserting into A0 c times. If it fails, try inserting into A1 c times. If it fails, go down the "funnel" until you find a free slot.Call \delta the fraction of slots that are empty (I'm unclear if this is a parameter that gets set at hash table creation or one that's dynamically updated). Setting c = log(1/d) and k = log(1/d) to get worst case complexity O(log^2(1/d)).This circumvents Yao's result by not being greedy. Yao's result holds true for greedy insertion and search policies and the above is non-greedy, as it's cascading down the funnels.There are probably many little hairy details to work out but that's the idea, as far as I've been able to understand it. People should let me know if I'm way off base.This very much reminds me of the "Distinct Elements in Streams" idea by Chakraborty, Vinodchandran and Meel[2].[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43007860[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQNyOU1hyE[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10191&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk by the inventor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQNyOU1hyE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43002511</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liquid capsaicin treatments for bird seed are an effective squirrel repellent.They also illustrate the evolution of this protein: birds have no receptors for capsaicin, while mammals do. Birds eat seeds mostly intactly. Their digestive systems are capable of breaking them down - but it's stochastic and some seeds make it through the bird undigested, being redistributed elsewhere. Obviously, having an agent sow your seeds widely is a fitness advantage, and so seedy plants are ultimately served well even if 90+% of their caloric investment into seeds goes into the birds.Mammals, on the other hand, have teeth - particularly molars. Mammals that eat seeds grind them apart orally before even swallowing. As a result, any seeds ingested by mammals are very likely to be completely destroyed. Plants - peppers, anyway - found a chemical irritant that repels the mammals without even being sensed by birds.I've used one such treatment (with an amusing logo illustrataion - https://i.imgur.com/JAl8vyW.png) to good effect to discourage squirrels at my feeder, so that they stick to my dedicated squirrel bungee with a log of compressed corn instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The human mind will never cease to delight me, what an amazing read ^^&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's one of the best blog posts I've read in a while.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significant pitfalls of firing employees in the tech industry, arguing that such decisions often stem from short-term thinking and a lack of understanding of long-term implications. It emphasizes the detrimental effects of layoffs on company culture, morale, and future recruitment efforts. The author advocates for alternative approaches, such as restructuring or reassessing roles, to retain talent and foster a more resilient workforce in the face of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's such a huge disconnect between people reading headlines and developers who are actually trying to use AI day to day in good faith.  We know what it is good at and what it's not.It's incredibly far away from doing any significant change in a mature codebase.  In fact I've become so bearish on the technology trying to use it for this, I'm thinking there's going to have to be some other breakthrough or something other than LLM's.  It just doesn't feel right around the corner.  Now completing small chunks of mundane code, explaining code, doing very small mundane changes.  Very good at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is entirely built on 2 big and wrong assumptions:1. AI code ability will be the same as is today2. Companies will replace people for AI en masse at a given moment in timeOf course both these assumptions are wrong, the quality of code produced by AI will improve dramatically as model evolves. And is not even just the model itself. The tooling, the Agentic capabilities and workflow will entirely change to adapt to this. (Already doing)The second assumption is also wrong, intelligent companies will not layoff en masse to use AI only, they will most likely slow hiring devs because their existing enhanced devs using AI will suffice enough to their coding related needs. At the end of the day product is just one area of company development, build the complete e2e ultimate solution with 0 distribution or marketing will not help.This article, in my opinion, is just doomerism storytelling for nostalgic programmers, that see programming only as some kind of magical artistic craft and AI as the villain arrived to remove all the fun from it. You can still switch off Cursor and write donut.c if you enjoy doing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My opinion: tech isn't firing programmers for AI. If is firing peogrammers because of the financial environment, and waving around AI as a fig leaf to pretend that it is not really cutting back in output.When the financial environment loosens again, there’ll be a new wave of tech hiring (which is about equally likely to publicly be portrayed as either reversing the AI firing or exploiting new opportunities due to AI, neither of which will be the real fundamental driving force.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43010814</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did something similar but using a K80 and M40 I dug up from eBay for pennies. Be advised though, stay as far away as possible from the K80 - the drivers were one of the most painful tech things I've ever had to endure, even if 24GB of VRAM for 50 bucks sounds incredibly appealing. That said, I had a decent-ish HP workstation laying around with 1200 watt power supply so I had where to put those two in. The one thing to note here is that these types of GPUs do not have a cooling of their own. My solution was to 3d print a bunch of brackets and attach several Noctua fans and have them blow at full speed 24/7. Surprisingly it worked way better than I expected - I've never gone above 60 degrees. As a side efffect, the CPUs are also benefiting from this hack: at idle, they are in the mid-20 degrees range. Mind you, the noctua fans are located on the front and the back of the case: the ones on the front act as an intake and the ones on the back as exhaust and there's two more inside the case that are stuck in front of the GPUs.The workstation was refurbished for just over 600 bucks, and another 120 bucks for the GPUs and another ~60 for the fans.Edit: and before someone asks - no I have not uploaded the STL's anywhere cause I haven't had the time but also since this is a very niche use case, though I might: the back(exhaust) bracket came out brilliant the first try - it was a sub-millimeter fit. Then I got cocky and thought that I'd also nail it first try on the intake and ended up re-printing it 4 times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the same price ($1799) you could buy a Mac Mini with 48gb of unified memory and an m4 pro. It’d probably use less power and be much quieter to run and likely could outperform this setup in terms of tokens per second. I enjoyed the write up still, but I would probably just buy a Mac in this situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d really love to build a machine for local LLMs. I’ve tested models on my MBP M3 Max with 128GB of ram and it’s really cool but I’d like a dedicated local server. I’d also like an excuse to play with proxmox as I’ve just run raw Linux servers or UnRaid w/ containers in the past.I have OpenWebUI and LibreChat running on my local “app server” and I’m quite enjoying that but every time I price out a beefier box I feel like the ROI just isn’t there, especially for an industry that is moving so fast.Privacy is not something to ignore at all but the cost of inference online is very hard to beat, especially when I’m still learning how best to use LLMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999297</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of keyword arguments (kwargs) in Python programming, explaining how they allow for flexible function calls by accepting an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. It covers the syntax for defining functions with kwargs and demonstrates their practical uses, such as enabling default values and simplifying code by avoiding the need for multiple parameters. The article also provides examples to illustrate how kwargs can improve code readability and maintainability while emphasizing their importance in writing efficient Python functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43006536"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just don't understand why some people are so fascinated by this. Can you all admit that this is not at all practical? I swear C++ folks like it for the sake of it. No other engineer do this. Only antiques people or whatever.Can you imagine an engineer that is adamant on using his mystifying bespoke tool instead of just using a ruler. "But what if I have to measure it in the 4th dimension!?".I was expecting something simple but good Lord, its kwargs. Not some magical asynchronous runtime.inb4 there are still corner cases so you can't just say "users don't have to know the implementation details so only one person has to suffer". I bet money this abstraction is leaky.Why can't you just do this at the language level like any sane person?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is all, as the title suggests, good fun, but I wouldn't use it for any real code. Instantiating the parameter struct on a separate line adds only a small amount of extra boilerplate at the call site, in return for which it's a million times easier to read than any of these tricks.   FooArgs fooArgs;
   fooArgs.y = 4;
   foo(fooArgs);   // Didn't set .x so it has default value

Three lines instead of one seems like a lot of overhead, but in practice you would only bother for a function that takes loads of arguments so the extra overhead is really much smaller.----Smaller points:Are the fields in FooArgs really initialised if they're not explicitly set? I can believe they are, after all it's brace initialisation. But IMHO that code isn't super obvious. I'd be more comfortable if they had default member initialisers, i.e., "int x = 0; int y = 0;" in FooArgs. In my version above, you really do need these (unless you remember to brace initialise).It took me a while to see why they bothered to have a string template parameter for TypedArg in the first usage. It prevents mixing up two arguments: if TypedArg didn't have that, then you could call foo(y=3, x=2) and it would compile but have the effect that the parameter x would be 3 and y would be 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are willing to use macros anyway, you can make the following work in C++ today:   foo($(bar)=10, $(baz)="hello");

In fact you could 10 years ago when I implemented it[1]; in fact it allows significantly more than just named arguments (named tuples!), but please, consider it as some sort of art and not really something that should be anywhere close to production.[1] https://github.com/gpderetta/libtask/blob/a5e6e16ddc4e00d9f7...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43006536</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Moreover, once it [Threads] was developed, the infrastructure teams were given only two day’s notice to prepare for its production launch. Most large organizations would take longer than two days just to draft a project plan involving dozens of interdependent teams, let alone execute it. At Meta, however, we quickly established war rooms across distributed sites, bringing together both infrastructure and product teams to address issues in real-time. Despite the tight timeline, the app’s launch was highly successful, reaching 100 million users within just five days, making it the fastest-growing app in history.Kind of more impressive to have kept this ability to ship fast than anything else. A lot of work is needed to not let the bureaucracy increase and stop the lawyers or other functions from creating approval gates everywhere. Or at least to be able to have war rooms that can get it done so quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I was at FB (it wasn't Meta then), I saw what a superpower the infrastructure is there. Product engineers build things of a scale in days. While I was there, I got to be tech lead for several different teams (2x distributed dbs, 1x Dev Efficiency, 1x Ads), some of which are called out by name here.Shout out to the HBase and ZippyDB teams! This is the first public acknowledgment that ZippyDB was converged upon.It's also super cool to see the Developer Efficiency pushes called out. 10,000 Services pushed daily, or every commit is so impressive.When I left FB, I couldn't find anything close. So, I'm building the infra that I was missing as a startup.  Batteries Included. https://www.batteriesincl.com/ https://github.com/batteries-included/batteries-included/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it interesting how they describe the PHP web front end as a "serverless" or "function as a service" architecture. I guess it's a matter of perspective. It's a service that has a monolithic codebase with lots of endpoints deployed to it. I guess from the perspective of the maintainer of one of those endpoints it's "serverless" but that abstraction (like all abstractions) has leaks: the teams responsible for the top endpoints and those working on shared libraries can't treat the infra as a given, but rather need to be acutely aware of its limitations and performance characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43008920</guid></item><item><title>7.

It took me 2 months of non-stop brute forcing to figure them out but eventually I figured them out. One of the things they could do is play sound and the test to check if they work when the technicians were installing them was to play the imperial march. When I showed it to the technicians, one of them said "Oh, you copied the floppy drive guy?"I had no idea what he was talking about until he showed me. Lesson learned: it's the internet, you are never the first.But damn, this is impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you love the sound of the Floppotron, chiptunes and metal, I can heartily recommend Master Boot Record. https://masterbootrecord.bandcamp.com/album/hardwarez https://soundcloud.com/masterbootrecordmusic/doom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wondered what happened to it. The YouTube channel used do be quite active, with a new song about every month, but it has definitely slowed down since the Floppotron 3.0, and the last update is now nearly 2 years old.Only 8 songs have been released on the Floppotron 3.0, compared to about a hundred on the 2.0, why so much effort designing and building such a machine not to use it and also make money?Or maybe, and that's actually what I am interested in, is it featured anywhere else? Live performances? Collab albums? etc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43007628</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses issues with NVIDIA's RTX 5090 graphics card, specifically problems related to the power connector melting or burning. Reports have emerged from users experiencing failures due to overheating and other failures associated with the connector design. The piece highlights the potential risks and concerns for consumers and may impact NVIDIA's reputation in the market as users seek reliable hardware for high-performance gaming and workloads. It also outlines responses from NVIDIA regarding the matter and potential solutions being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;12vhpwr has almost no safety margin. Any minor problem with it rapidly becomes major. 600W is scary, with reports of 800W spikes.12V2x6 is particularly problematic because any imbalance, such as a bad connection of a single pin, will quickly push things over spec. For example, at 600W, 8.3A are carried on each pin in the connector. Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connectors are typically rated to 8.5A -- That's almost no margin. If a single connection is bad, current per connector goes to 10A and we are over spec. And this if things are mated correctly. 8.5A-10A over a partially mated pin will rapidly heat up to the point of melting solder. Hell, the 16 gauge wire typically used is pushing it for 12V/8.5A/100W -- that's rated to 10A. Really would like to see more safety margin with 14 gauge wire.In short, 12V2x6 has very little safety margin. Treat it with respect if you care for your hardware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would love to get some insight from Nvidia engineers on what happened here.The 3 series and before were overbuilt in their power delivery system. How did we get from that to the 1 shunt resistor, incredibly dangerous fire-hazard design of the 5 series? [1] Even after the obvious problems with 4 series, Nvidia actually doubled down and made it _worse_!The level of incompetence here is actually astounding to me. Nvidia has some of the top, most well paid EE people in the industry. How the heck did this happen?1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb5YzMoVQyw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Derbauer and Buildzoid on YouTube made nice informative videos on subject, and no it is not "simply a user error".

&lt;p&gt;The article on Bernstein Bear discusses the importance of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in providing financial assistance to individuals and families, particularly the elderly, disabled, and survivors of deceased workers. It emphasizes the various benefits offered by the SSA, including retirement, disability, and survivor benefits, while outlining the eligibility criteria and application process. Additionally, the piece highlights the significance of staying informed about Social Security rights and options to ensure that citizens maximize their benefits effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pro tips from an SSA hacker.- Ignore the SSA conversion algorithms that don’t use dominance frontiers. Also ignore the dominator tree generation algorithms that aren’t Langauer-Trajan. Reason: you’ll want to have a dominator tree (ie immediate dominators) anyway for a bunch of SSA optimizations. So, you’ll want Langauer-Tarjan. And if you have that, then using dominance frontiers to generate SSA is just easier.- CPS isn’t really anything like SSA. Don’t believe that hype. Any claim in PL of two languages or forms being equivalent is not falsifiable because any two Turing complete languages are going to have some transformation between them, so really these papers are just saying “hey look I invented a translation that we all knew was going to be possible and I like my translation for aesthetic reasons”. Working with CPS is nothing like working with SSA.- The best way I know of representing Phi in your SSA IR is a Pizlo special. I haven’t written it up except by implementing it (JavaScriptCore uses Pizlo SSA). Here’s the idea. Phi takes no arguments (no block arguments and no value arguments). Each Phi has a shadow variable (in addition to the implicit SSA variable it assigns to). Phi just loads the value out of its shadow variable and assigns it to its implicit variable. Then I have a second instruction called Upsilon that takes two args: an input variable and a Phi. It loads the input variable’s implicit value (just as any SSA use would) and stores it to the Phi’s shadow variable. The result of using this IR is that you have zero coupling between your CFG and the SSA graph. It makes CFG transforms much much easier to write. It also means much less special casing of Phi, in practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone suggest simple to implement algorithms for SSA destruction? I find Cytron's destruction easy (paired with copy propagation), but the more recent ones are difficult to implement directly from the papers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks helpful. I would love to find a simple method of generating SSA that can deal with goto statements.A paper that was suggested to me (not mentioned in the linked blog post) is:"Practical Improvements to the Construction and Destruction of Static Single Assignment Form",

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a lawsuit filed by Thomson Reuters against the company OpenAI, alleging that OpenAI's AI models unlawfully used Thomson Reuters' copyrighted legal data to train their technology. The lawsuit highlights concerns about intellectual property rights in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Thomson Reuters argues that their data is invaluable and should not be utilized without compensation, raising broader questions about the legality and ethics of using copyrighted material in AI development. The case reflects ongoing debates around copyright law and the influence of AI on the legal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/mu49I&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the full decision, which (like most decisions!) is largely written to be legible to non-lawyers: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.721...The core story seems to be: Westlaw writes and owns headnotes that help lawyers find legal cases about a particular topic. Ross paid people to translate those headnotes into new text, trained an AI on the translations, and used those to make a model that helps lawyers find legal cases about a particular topic. In that specific instance the court says this plan isn't fair use. If it was fair use, one could presumably just pay people to translate headnotes directly and make a Westlaw competitor, since translating headnotes is cheaper than writing new ones. And conversely if it isn't fair use where's the harm (the court notes no copyright violation was necessary for interoperability for example) -- one can still pay people to write fresh headnotes from caselaw and create the same training set.The court emphasizes "Because the AI landscape is changing rapidly, I note for readers that only non-generative AI is before me today." But I'm not sure "generative" is that meaningful a distinction here.You can definitely see how AI companies will be hustling to distinguish this from "we trained on copyrighted documents, and made a general purpose AI, and then people paid to use our AI to compete with the people who owned the documents." It's not quite the same, the connection is less direct, but it's not totally different.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross “meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute.”Yep. That's what people have been saying all along. If the intent is to substitute the original, then copying is not fair use.But the problem is that the current method for training requires this volume of data. So the models are legitimately not viable without massive copyright infringement.It'll be interesting to see how a defendant with a larger wallet will fare. But this doesn't look good.Though big-picture, it seems to me that the money-ed interests will ensure that even if the current legal landscape doesn't allow LLM's to exist, then they will lobby HARD until it is allowed. This is inevitable now that it's at least partially framed in national security terms.But I'd hope that this means there is a chance that if models have to train on all of human content, the weights will be available for free to all humans. If it requires massive copyright infringement on our content, we should all have an ownership stake in the resulting models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43018251</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey Seth and Ayo - congrats on this launch. 
While I think there’s certainly room for improvement, which I’ll address below - this demo makes me feel that you both can keep grinding and succeed with this.
The main feedback I have is similar to others who asked how this is better than Cursor running with a react native codebase and iOS simulator running on the side. 
I read your response about being better at iOS/android specific things could be the case (for example, making it really nail payments and subscriptions could be useful) - but it is definitely going to be a tough battle. 
If someone can only use your platform and reliably have a react native codebase (version controlled on GitHub), with working Supabase auth, and fully synced with Expo (so basically almost ready to go)- that would be pretty cool! 
I also think there’s room for you guys to add value around some of the other annoying parts of launching a native app. 
If your app was able to automatically make App Store creatives and essentially publish the app for me with some user-promoting - that would be sick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is this different from just using Cursor on my react-native codebase? Cursor in agent mode means: no copy paste, implements features and fixes errors iteratively, knows my codebase and adheres to existing patterns. If I need changes, I just ask Cursor and preview live app changes locally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your title is honest, and your description of the limitations is honest. It is also pragmatic to allow you to try it without registering. This is the way to success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43015267</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that technology perceived as "boring" is often the most mature and reliable, contrasting it with more exciting but potentially unstable innovations. The author emphasizes that mature technology, such as established operating systems and hardware, provides stability and efficiency, allowing users to focus on productivity rather than troubleshooting issues. The piece encourages embracing these dependable tools, suggesting that their reliability is what ultimately drives progress in technology rather than constant pursuit of the latest trends.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO boring tech is great because it lets you focus on the actual tech of your product. I run a SaaS app and I'd like to think we do alot of cutting edge things in various places, as it relates to the actual product. For things that are "behind the scenes" like databases, backend fraemworks, etc, etc, I prefer to keep all that stuff as boring and as stable as possible. For me working solo on a project, my time is very limited. So I would much rather work on interesting new features for my product than having to touch crap that my customers don't care about. Because at the end of the day my customers don't know and don't care that I use Node vs Deno or Bun, or that I use NPM instead of pnpm, or that I'm not on the latest version of node or Postgres. They don't know all that but they do know how well my app works or what features it has.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see your point here, but I want represent a counterpoint to this line of reasoning, from my personal experience. I've been in a lot of situations where someone simply wants their way--in this case they want the organization to choose their personal software preference--and so they call it the "boring" choice.By calling it boring, they characterize their _preference_ as the majority accepted, mature, obvious decision and anything else is merely software engineers chasing shiny objects. The truth is almost always more nuanced. Both solutions have pros and cons. They trade-off different values that resonate more or less with different people.So, please be careful with the "it's boring and therefore obviously better" argument. Don't let it be a way to summarily dismiss someone else's preferences in favor of your own--without a deeper discussion of trade-offs. Otherwise it's no better than any other condescending attempt (ex. I'm in charge, so we are doing it this way. No one ever got fired choosing IBM/Microsoft/..) to win an argument without having to present real arguments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would only add "stable" to what "boring" tech is.  Notably, though, not "stable" as in "doesn't crash."  But more as in "doesn't change."I think you typically see this with older, established, things.  But there is nothing guaranteeing it.  And, indeed, it is often the result of specific action on the stewards of a technology.This can often be couched in terms of backwards compatibility.  Which is a clear action one can pursue to get stability.  However, it can also be seen in greatly limiting scope.  As an example, we love talking about scale, but that doesn't mean you have to design and build for scale you will never see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43012862</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The TinyX project on GitHub provides a minimalistic implementation of the X Window System designed for Tiny Core Linux. It aims to deliver a lightweight and efficient graphical environment suitable for resource-constrained systems. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and guidelines for building and installing TinyX, making it accessible for developers looking to integrate or customize X for use on small footprint devices. Additionally, the project emphasizes simplicity and modularity, allowing users to add only the necessary components for their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

The Linux kernel still runs static binaries built in mid-90s.Judging from the feature list, TinyX hits a very sweet spot for otherwise underpowered or obsolete machines. You can of course spend €50 and get a RasPi that can handle a more complex / demanding stack, but also you can take advantage of the spare power, or just appreciate the architectural simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thread at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36498484&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While the original codebase is MIT, any changes here are GPLv3.What’s the argument on why to change to a less permissive license?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43004435</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of thoughtful design in the physical controls of cars, emphasizing how intuitive and user-friendly controls enhance driver experience and safety. It highlights the balance between aesthetics and functionality in control layouts, suggesting that good design should minimize distraction and allow for seamless interaction. The piece also explores the impact of evolving technology on vehicle design, advocating for a focus on the human element in control systems, to ensure that drivers can operate vehicles effectively and confidently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the author for putting thought into how to design digital controls, in contrast to the "just put whatever garbage on a touch screen" strategy most carmakers do today.However, I still question the benefit of this complex, modal control (you have to press a single knob to "cycle between" multiple modes). My ancient, 2016 car features three knobs. This luxury allows me to, without looking, adjust any of three settings (temp, fan, air location), as well as a button which does each seat heater, without any "check what mode it's in, tap, look at the tiny screen, tap again if necessary" step.True, in this trim, my car does not have a thermostat mode, which in theory is useful, but it is so trivial to modulate the temperature based on "do I feel cold, hot or comfortable right now" and reaching over to twist one of the controls anyway, and even in the other car I have which has this mode, I frequently need to adjust things anyway, except in that car some of the functions require multiple mode changes on the touch screen and looking away from the road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, hi, creator of the SmartKnob (mentioned in the article) here - I'm continually blown away by how much UX discussion it has generated over the years!One of the things I regret a bit about the prototype and demo I originally shared is that I used a press action and the screen as a modal/menu interface. The screen makes for a snazzy demo video, and works great for interfaces where you have the user's full attention (like a smart home control panel) but I think there's a lot more potential for just the haptics, paired with other dedicated buttons to switch to specific (i.e. not a menu of) modes, like this later demo I built using the haptic feedback for a video timeline jog tool: https://youtu.be/J9192DfZplk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos for to the author for the work put into this and the intelligence functions are interesting.  I do have a couple concerns though.A. Trying to design down to two knobs makes each knob multi-modal.  This removes a lot of muscle memory benefits requiring a glance at a screen, a small screen that is now partially covered by your hand while operating the knob.  Haptic feedback might be able to help you know what mode you're in without looking but now you have a lot more to memorize to use it while keeping your eyes on the road which may begin to defeat the simplicity benefits.B. Haptic feedback... will this work with gloves on?  (will you feel it, will it sense your touch)A lot of manual systems now have 3 knobs, not much more than the 2 presented here, which will always do the same thing each time you reach for them.  My concern would be how long it would take the user to be familar with the interface without looking.  One quick thought, I would be inclined to think that feedback through a large screen not covered by your fingers might have advantages.It's a great study on UI consistancy however, esp around how to program the detents, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43017010</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;Indigenous engineers are leveraging artificial intelligence to help preserve their cultural heritage and promote language revitalization. By developing tools that utilize AI, these innovators aim to safeguard traditional knowledge and practices, ensuring that their cultures remain vibrant and accessible for future generations. The integration of technology and native traditions showcases a commitment to innovation while honoring ancestral roots, helping to bridge the gap between modern advancements and historical significance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am one of these people! I am one of a handful of people who speak my ancestral language, Kiksht. I am lucky to be uniquely well-suited to this work, as I am (as far as I know) the lone person from my tribe whose academic research background is in linguistics, NLP, and ML. (We have, e.g., linguists, but very few computational linguists.)So far I have not had that much luck getting the models to learn the Kiksht grammar and morphology via in-context learning, I think the model will have to be trained on the corpus to actually work for it. I think this mostly makes sense, since they have functionally nothing in common with western languages.To illustrate the point a bit: the bulk of training data is still English, and in English, the semantics of a sentence are mainly derived from the specific order in which the words appear, mostly because it lost its cases some centuries ago. Its morphology is mainly "derivational" and mainly suffixal, meaning that words can be arbitrarily complicated by adding suffixes to them. So baked into English is word order that sometimes we insert words into sentences simply to make the word order sensible. e.g., when we say "it's raining outside", the "it's" refers to nothing at all—it is there entirely because the word order of English demands that it exists.Kiksht in contrast is completely different. Its semantics are nearly entirely derived from triple-prefixal structure of (in particular) verbs. Word ordering almost does not matter. There are, like, 12 tenses, and some of them require both a prefix and a reflective suffix. Verbs are often 1 or 2 characters, and with the prefix structure, a single verb can often be a complete sentence. And so on.I will continue working on this because I think it will eventually be of help. But right now the deep learning that has been most helpful to me has been to do things like computational typology. For example, discovering the "vowel inventory" of a language is shockingly hard. Languages have somewhat consistent consonants, but discovering all the varieties of `a` that  one can say in a language is very hard, and deep learning is strangely good at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm an Australian indigenous and have been slowly working on this problem in my own way for a few years.https://github.com/australia/mobtranslate.com/In it's current iteration the homepage is just running dictionaries through OpenAI. (my tribes dictionary fits in a 100k context window)My old ambitions can be found somewhat here -&gt; https://github.com/australia/mobtranslate-serverThat being said, the OpenAI models do a fantastic job at translating sentences so I've put my own model research further to the back.

(and kind of how language evolves anyway) (the noun replacement seems to work great, but grammar is obviously wishy-washy)(At this point, I just rushed to get my tribes dictionary crawlable so hopefully it will be in a few models next training phases)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fwiw this is the original usage of llms. The whole context awareness came about for the purpose of translations and the famous ‘attention is all you need’ paper was from the google translation team.Say what you will about llms being overhyped but this is the original core use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42969993</guid></item><item><title>16.

With the B580 falling inbetween the 7600 and 7600 XT in terms of pricing, it seems a bit unfair to only compare it with the former.- RX 7600 (8GB) ~€300- RTX 4060 (8GB) ~€310- Intel B580 (12GB) ~€330- RX 7600 XT (16GB) ~€350- RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) ~€420- RTX 4060 Ti (16GB) ~€580**Apparently this card is really rare plus a bad value proposition, so it is hard to find&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loosely related question:What prevents manufacturers from taking some existing mid/toprange consumer GPU design, and just slapping like 256GB VRAM onto it? (enabling consumers to run big-LLM inference locally).Would that be useless for some reason? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly tangential: Nvidia has over 22.5K patents: https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Nvidia+Corporation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43014408</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the workings of Copyover MUD servers, a type of multiplayer online role-playing game that facilitated interactive storytelling and social interaction among players. It explains the server architecture, including how data was managed and shared between players, and highlights the unique features that defined the Copyover MUD experience, such as real-time communication and character persistence. The piece also reflects on the impact these servers had on the development of online gaming and community dynamics during their peak.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That was an amusing post to see pop up here, as I believe I came up with the "copyover" name when I copied Melvin Smith (aka "Fusion") idea about "hot reboot" from his "MUD++" code base to the popular Diku-based MERC/Envy etc. bases -- that was 2000 or probably earlier. Whether Melvin originally got the idea from somewhere else I don't know.That version just used exec, and closed all files but network descriptors already logged in, the mapping of fds -&gt; login names was saved in a file. When the new copy started up, it would log the users on existing file descriptors. Today, using explicit file descriptor passing (so you don't accidentally keep files open) or a long-running proxy would be preferable.Back then C/C++ were often used by the developers, and we were at best CS students. There were surprisingly few segmentation faults, but I remember a few mysterious memory corruptions...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a fun blast from the past. One of my first real programming experiences was working as a (the) programmer on a MUD and I remember learning about this technique somewhere (I think just reading about how forking worked) and then figuring out how to implement it on our MUD.It felt absolutely magical to be able to hot deploy changes without kicking everyone off of the server - but felt even more magical to have gotten it to work.The MUD community was a fun early introduction to open source. People (many of them probably "kids" like I was at the time) sharing various patches and features. It felt so cool to release something and have other people use it and provide feedback. Like the author says - at some point the MUD itself became a lot less interesting than the programming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually run a MUD that stills uses this copyover method (primarily C code) for major code changes and migrations. We have about 100 players online at any given time! We've actually built in some more modern automatic copyover triggers and hooks related to recovering from crashes, capturing backtraces, performing database migrations, and sending/receiving systemd signals (among a lot of other modernization upgrades).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43007769</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of vocational training and skilled labor in revitalizing a sense of purpose and community in the workforce. It argues that by honoring and promoting trades and hands-on work, society can strengthen its economy and national identity. The piece highlights the need for a cultural shift that values craftsmanship and encourages young people to pursue careers in trades, thus fostering pride in work that directly contributes to society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My father was a machinist for 25 years and then went into education and training for skilled trades, very much screamed about this for most my life. When I dropped out of college, he tried to get me to just enter an apprenticeship for a trade. It’ll be dirty, uncomfortable, sometimes painful, he said, but you’ll leave your work when you go home, and if you’re dedicated and half-good at it, you could eventually have your own business and crew before the physical stuff catches up to you. By then the lack of experienced tradesmen here will have turned into an crisis and I would be in an enviable spot. Here I am, 25 years later, worried I didn’t listen.Hypothetically, I wonder how viable it is to switch to a vocation like electrician or HVAC in your 40s-50s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish education wasn't so split between "academic" and "vocational" (for lack of better terms).In high school for my A levels I was able to take both Maths, Physics and Politics (with an academic focus) and Metalworking and Photography (with a more practical hands-on focus). I loved this, and feel like this was incredibly useful to me later in life.But for some reason beyond school level you are mostly forced to choose between academics and hands-on work (at least in the UK). With the hands-on pathways being looked down on by much of society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm glad the "heavy" part of this is not understated. The big iron is out there, surprisingly cheap, and it usually stays put for quite a while because it is a damn bitch to move. Tear down a wall, and put it back later. And make sure your floor won't cave in.If you ever get yourself into serious hobby machining, get ready for the average density of all your possessions to double.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43016248</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential implementation of trailing commas in SQL syntax, drawing comparisons to other programming languages that allow this feature. The author argues that using trailing commas can enhance code readability and maintainability by simplifying modifications, such as reordering or adding items in lists. Additionally, the piece highlights the challenges and considerations surrounding the adoption of this feature in SQL, including backward compatibility and the implications for existing codebases. Overall, the author advocates for the benefits of incorporating trailing commas into SQL standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43010365"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel the problem. When coding (not only in SQL) you often have to add something to the end of a list, and it is annoying that the end of the list is always special. You can't just copy some line and move it there. Also when moving things around you always have to take extra care at the end.So, my solution for this was always  SELECT a
       , b
       , c 
  FROM ...

instead of:  SELECT a,
         b,
         c,  -- people want to allow trailing comma here
  FROM ...

Leading commas also are also very regular and visible. A missing trailing comma is a lot harder to see.Before people start to mess with the standard, I'd suggest to maybe just change your coding style - and make the start of the list special - instead of the end.I'd suggest going for a lot less trailing commas - instead of allowing more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please god. I don't believe in you but maybe someone else does and will think me a kindred spirit worthy of mercy. Let me have trailing commas. There is no reason not to. It's backward compatible, easy to implement and would make the world so so so much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I'm sure that 99% of the people who are requesting trailing comma support care about select lists. And CREATE TABLE for the rest. Yes, the SQL standard has a huge surface area of custom syntax (rather then most programming languages which have a smaller number of composable atoms), which makes adding "consistent" syntax changes a challenge, but it doesn't mean you need to boil the ocean. Just get trailing comma select lists into a version I'm likely to use in the next decade and I will love you forever!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43010365</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article seems interested in suggestion Japan abandon its unique approach and adopt the approach used by other nations. That is silly.Japan is one of the foremost funders of deep research. It funds large physics experiments. It has a long history of semiconductor innovations. MEXT scholarships have proven a brilliant method to attract smart men and women from around the world.Here in Touhoku I've met so many bright international students on MEXT scholarships doing research within those exact project-funded teams. Switching to person-focused funding would be silly, do you really think a smart guy from Congo is going to be able to win funding? That Japan has a system where the product/team can focus on an established topic, then backfill with smart researches, is a strength not a weakness.Of course Nature is in the business of publishing papers, not science. So it makes sense they would be blind to the reality of science: you measure it in results not papers. The academics I know are all focused on achieve specific goals, they rarely talk about the papers in the way the Canadian Acedemics I know did back home. Think "I want to automate boar trap monitoring so that farmers do not need to check it everytime, and so that non-boars do not get trapped". That is the sort of highly practical research you get when a supervisor knows their field and knows their country. It might not pay off in papers, but it will pay off for Japan as a country.The world should be taking lessons from Japan, not the other way around. Team based funding. Scholarships for bright students from any country. Deep funding for physical research other than just ITER and LHC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[stub for offtopicness][see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43018086 for why]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43016353</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of relational quantum mechanics (RQM), which posits that the properties of quantum systems are relational and depend on the interactions between observers and systems rather than being intrinsic to the systems themselves. It explores the implications of this view for understanding quantum measurements, the nature of reality, and the role of the observer in quantum mechanics. The article analyzes various interpretations and criticisms of RQM, positioning it within the broader context of quantum theory and philosophical debates surrounding the interpretation of quantum phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;RQM is an interesting viewpoint on QM that I have not encountered before, even though it was apparently introduced in 1996.It says that the physical world is a collection of discrete events, doing away with continuous time. It also says that every event involves two systems, in that each event takes place in one system relative to another system.The idea seems a little strange but the article gives a more intuitive example. It doesn't make sense to talk about the absolute velocity of a particle, only its relative velocity with respect to a reference frame.But RQM takes it further. It brings to mind the old question about "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it." I guess RQM would say that this question isn't even wrong.The article quickly becomes too technical for me to understand, so I'm still confused about some aspects. For instance, if each event only involves two systems, how is it that we can have a whole population of systems (eg scientists) eventually coming to a consensus about some phenomenon (eg the value of some physical quantity?) It seems necessary to have a unified global system coordinating the whole thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ double (a) variables only take value at discrete interactions and (b) the value a variable takes is only relative to the (other) system affected by the interaction.”Layperson here. Can I read this as saying yes to locality, no to realism, and violation of causality since this only depends on who measured it, another interaction could interpret cause and effect  differently?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gotta put in a plug for QIT, which is very similar, but I think a little easier to understand:https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9512022and a more accessible version that I wrote a long time ago:https://flownet.com/ron/QM.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43006350</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this to be a fascinating dive into a potentially serious safety concern. I was impressed how simple the mitigations could be based on the recommendations in the report. I find the evidence credible for an attempt to burry the issue, but honestly I don't understand the motivation. At this stage I feel Boeing and the FAA could really stand to gain some good press from being extra proactive about such issues. Especially when the proposed mitigations seem like they would be relatively easy to implement, and should not be expensive for airlines from what I can see. It seems like the source being the engine manufacturer and consequently having the potential of affecting other jets including potentially the airbus A320 would only improve the incentives for Boeing to get out ahead of this, and demonstrate a safety culture. Does anyone understand the motivations that could lead to the response we have seen from the FAA and Boeing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a issue that may also affect Airbus aircraft, but so far, it has only caused problems on two Boeing planes. Like MCAS, it was not disclosed to pilots, prompting the FAA to recommend design changes and notify flight crews.https://simpleflying.com/boeing-cfm-international-update-737...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tl;dw: when a particular engine design used by the 737 MAX (but also other Boeing and Airbus planes) ingests a bird, if there's enough damage, it starts burning oil before the cabin bleed air intake. The cockpit and cabin have air supplied from different engines. Since the cockpit is relatively small, if the cockpit engine was damaged, smoke would fill the cockpit quickly, reducing the pilots' visibility and requiring them to don air masks. Bird strikes only happen at takeoff and landing--times when pilots don't have time to be fiddling with masks and seeing through smoke and trying to shut off the damaged engine. Regulators in the US and EU don't seem especially concerned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42994590</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These sorts of "fun" things are only a good idea if your software is already good. Otherwise they'll just make your users hate your product even more ("what the hell did you spend your effort on!?")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once shipped a product whose app icon within the app disappeared if clicked, revealing a square “monitor” with a small version of Breakout you had better start playing with your left/right arrow keys because the game started upon appearance.EDIT:In a user's guide I introduced diagrams of calculations with points for scalar values, vertical bars for vectors, and then square 2-D grids to represent matrices, which I referred to as "waffles". With "waffle", referenced by page, in the index at the back of the guide.I wondered if anyone would register the mild ridiculousness, but I had people coming up to me in conferences later laughing about matrix waffles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my absolute favorite pieces of software of all time is "Toot!", the Mastodon client on iOS. It's because it exemplifies this type of development extremely well, with most interaction in the app having some kind of fun little thing attached to it. Favorite a post? It starts an animation from the start turning the entire post gold, which persists and IIRC shimmers occasionally. Boost a post? It pops it out and moves the post up the screen before putting the post back. There are lots of little fun things it does, and it just makes it so fun to interact with. We need more software that embodies this type of design, letting things be more fun or whimsical, instead of super serious or "corporate fun" (e.g.: Notion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42978825</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" explores a novel approach for sequence-to-sequence tasks using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors propose an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input sequence to generate context vectors, and the decoder uses these vectors to produce the output sequence. This method demonstrates significant improvements in tasks such as machine translation and speech recognition, highlighting the effectiveness of neural networks in handling variable-length input and output sequences. The paper details the model's design, implementation, and results from experimental evaluations, showcasing its potential for advancing natural language processing and related fields.&lt;/p&gt;

It's an interesting read, and is also being discussed on HN [1].... [T]hese researchers are working long hours to put themselves out of a job. They need AI agents that can think ahead, so engineers train agents to forecast. They hold out training data before 2024, instructing models to ponder for hours to predict events in 2025. Then, they apply the same trick as before, distilling pondering into a gut reaction. Forecasting ability is a broad foundation. The researchers build specialized ML research skills on top of it, training U3 to predict the results of every ML paper and ML experiment ever recorded.[0] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KFJ2LFogYqzfGB3uX/how-ai-tak...[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43004579&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While interesting, the title is obviously a bit misleading.&gt; Our results on a temporally held-out test set of questions resolving after December 25, 2024 show that for both of the models that we employed our method on, Phi-4 14B [15] and DeepSeek-R1 14B [14], we find accuracy improvements of between 7–10% over the base versions of these models as well as the same models fine-tuned with randomized outcome labels as a controlSo 7–10% improvement for small models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B and Phi-4-14B, approaching GPT-4o.It would be interesting if the same holds for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B which in my experience is far superior to to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B in almost every way, yet still runnable without DC class GPUsThe Ridge Plots of brier scores is probably a good hint if your application chan benefit based on it's tail dependence?IMHO this paper is all about making small models work better, and nothing suggests anything about frontier models or LLMs in general.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Artem here, co-founder of NewsCatcher (YC S22), our data has been used for research.Danny and team our old friends who are using our free/super-low pricing for academia and researchers.AMA, or feel free to email artem@newscatcherapi.comhttps://www.newscatcherapi.com/free-news-api&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43014918</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that people complain about most when it comes to using DAWs on Linux is that 90% of the plugins in the world are not available (at least, not without some relatively technical magic such as yabridge).It is therefore quite curious to see people get all excited about a DAW on another "platform" where at least 90% of the plugins in the world are not available, and in all likelihood are even less likely to ever become available than they are on Linux.There's certainly a role for a tool like this in education and for people who so far have no realized that they really need to have Pigments or fabfilter for their project. And yes, people do exaggerate the extent to which a specific plugin is needed. Nevertheless, the lack of ability to run essentially any of the existing 3rd party plugins would, were it a native DAW, be viewed as completely crippling.The webaudio modules "standard" offers some hope here, and I suspect that within 2-5 years, plugin toolkits like JUCE will allow you to build not just as "windows/VST3" or "Linux/LV2" or "macOS/AudioUnit" formats, but also "wasm/webaudiomodule" (or something like it). However, given how easy the various Linux options already are with JUCE, and how few plugin developers choose to use them, I have to wonder if the massively larger size of a "browser platform market" would be enough to get them to add another platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is deeply impressive, and of course the first thing I'm doing is sharing it with some mates. The technical completeness of this, the fact that you can do this sort of thing in the browser at all - that to me is mindblowing (I'm 52 and remember when marquee tags were a bit of a stretch...).But... like other commenters - there it stops, and I'm just not quite sure why.The audience is probably me. I'm an avid Ableton user - I pay a bloody fortune for it, I upgrade it every year, I am happy to support their development because it's an insanely - insanely - good piece of software that does everything I need it to do. I'm also now completely embedded in the clip view, so going back to a linear view just isn't a possibility for me.More to the point though - this clearly isn't aimed at people who know nothing about what they're doing. It's very non-amateur and clearly very, very powerful. But at the same time it isn't aimed at me, either - as someone who does know what they're doing, I'm thinking "um, VSTs?" or "clip view?" or "live performance / latency issues?" or whatever.So... who is the audience? Maybe there is a middle ground of people who don't have the means to fork out for a good desktop DAW. Maybe teenagers who are wanting to learn the principles without the spend. Maybe because it'd be very cool for collaborating? I just don't know.Nonetheless, it's an insane demonstration of what can be done in a browser these days and for that I massively doff my cap - amazing work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no such thing as DAW inside a browser. DAW is mostly about the lowest latency possible unless it's for the sole purpose of sound creation (synthesis/sampling). This would allow it to bear the name Digital Audio Rework Station (DARwS) In all other cases lowest latency, ASIO drivers etc. are a must-have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42988913</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the release of FLAC 1.5, an update to the popular free lossless audio codec. It highlights various new features and improvements in this version, including enhanced compression performance, better support for modern audio formats, and several bug fixes. The update aims to provide users with improved efficiency and usability when encoding and decoding audio files. Additionally, the article shares insights into the ongoing development and community engagement surrounding the FLAC project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing I'm excited about is decoding chained Ogg FLAC files.Some software wouldn't work correctly with FLAC-based Icecast streams if they used libFLAC/libFLAC++ for demuxing and decoding. Usually these streams mux into Ogg and send updated metadata by closing out the previous Ogg bitstream and starting a new one. If you were using libFLAC to demux and decode - when the stream updated, it would just hang forever. Apps would have to do their own Ogg demuxing and reset the decoder between streams.Chained Ogg FLAC allows having lossless internet radio streams with rich, in-band metadata instead of relying on out-of-band methods. So you could have in-band album art, artist info, links - anything you can cram into a Vorbis comment block.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s nice although probably not of much use to most people: iirc FLAC encoding was 60+x realtime on modern machines already so unless you need to transcode your entire library (which you could do in parallel anyway) odds are you spend more time on setting up the encoding than actually running it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, FLAC is now published as RFC 9639 [0].[0]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9639.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43012751</guid></item><item><title>31.

Something that could hold weather forecasts, family calendar events, reminders, pictures, etc. I like the matte look of e-ink.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could the folks at E Ink not afford a stock photo of a mall to Photoshop their product into for their press release?

Im sure there are some very smart and talented people working at Neuralink.
They should go work for someone else as their boss has shown himself to be a revolting person and the kind of leader who seeks to actively harm people who inconvenience him.This kind of behavior is not befitting of a company that will need to cultivate an incredible amount of trust from customers before they buy into the idea of a brain implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Noland suffered a spinal cord injury in a swimming accident and became paralyzed below his shoulders.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the phenomenon of hallucinatory thoughts experienced by individuals nearing death, examining the psychological and neurological factors that contribute to these experiences. It discusses how such hallucinations can serve as a coping mechanism for the dying, offering comfort or resolution. The piece also delves into the implications of these experiences for understanding consciousness and the mind, suggesting that they may reveal deeper insights into human perception and the nature of reality at the end of life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My father, at one point, imagined himself on a Greek island. “Ouzo!” He’d offer from his hospital bed.He was an avid fisherman and his last words were, distinctly, “Big fish.”Yet, he was mostly unconscious for his last day. I spent time talking with him as he slept, massaging his hands and feet. Later we had a party for him and played music. Around 10 at night he began to die (the breathing changes). At the very end he opened his eyes, looked at my mother, sister and me, and passed.It was a beautiful death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About eight hours before my father died he was having a conversation with his unseen mother, who died when he was 14.I asked him "Who are you talking to?" and got a rather rude response, not like him, "My mother" in a tone you give a five year old "go away kid you are bothering me".The International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) is worth checking out if you have interest.  I've never had a NDE, however I've spent a lot of time in their library in Durham North Carolina.https://iands.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even in the best of cases, our perceptions and interpretations of those perceptions are often dramatically flawed. Add on top of that neural atrophy, loss of oxygen, accumulation of senescent cells, poor clearance of waste products ... and what comes out is often going to be gibberish, as the remaining working parts of the mind attempts to construct a coherent narrative from the broken fragments of sensory input and failing memories.I got interested in consciousness 35 years ago or so when I read Oliver Sacks' "The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat". Although the various people depicted in the stories had some physical deficit due to a trauma of some kind, it vividly demonstrated how we rationalize our way through the world more than we reason our way through it. Our conscious mind is much more of a facade than we typically imagine.When people say, "Well, LLMs are just generating token N+1 from the previous N tokens, they really aren't thinking", I counter with this: we have been having this discussion -- are you at all aware of the stream of words coming out of your mouth, or are you hearing them the same time that I am?Yes, sometimes we have deliberate thought where we rehearse different lines of reasoning before uttering something, but 98% of the time we are spewing just like LLMs do. And when we do engage in deliberate thought, each of those trial sentences again just appears without consideration; we are simply post-hoc picking the one that feels best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999788</guid></item><item><title>35.

I've had mostly experience with IncrediBuild in the past, currently SN-DBS, but colleagues are looking into FASTBuild. Though my personal favorite is bazel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The funny thing about the name of the tool is that it's essentially named after a PHP linter I wrote while working at VK, called NoVerify. I did an internal poll for the best name, and noverify won, because the way to skip the checks done that linter was "git push --no-verify"...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like there are some infelicities documented that really should be fixed:* fix that silly "got another sha256" bug, it really shouldn't be hard* optimal job count should be infinite from the perspective of the client's `make`, but the daemon should only send jobs to the servers based on how many jobs they are willing to perform in parallel. Possibly split out the "upload blobs" part from the "actually run the build" part?* You should detect compiler version differences, which is essential for reliability. This is nontrivial (wrapper scripts, internal headers) but good solutions exist if you're willing to hard-code what compilers are supported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43007336</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the nuances of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic and highlights that many programming languages and compilers do not strictly adhere to this standard, leading to discrepancies and unexpected behaviors in calculations. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these limitations and the potential pitfalls of relying on floating-point representation in programming. The author provides examples and insights into how different environments may handle floating-point operations, ultimately urging developers to be cautious and informed when working with numerical computations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that the C standard explicitly disclaims correct rounding for these IEEE 754 functions (C23§F.3¶20).Also, there's a group of people who have been running tests on common libms, reporting their current accuracy states here: https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/papers/accuracy.pdf (that paper is updated ~monthly).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; All the standard Maths libraries which claim to be IEEE complaint I have tested are not compliant with this constraint.It is possible to read the standard in the way that they still remain compliant. The standard, as of IEEE 754-2019, does not require recommended operations to be implemented in accordance to the standard in my understanding; implementations are merely recommended to ("should") define recommended operations with the required ("shall") semantics. So if an implementation doesn't claim that given recommended operation is indeed compliant, the implementation remains complaint in my understanding.One reason for which I think this might be the case is that not all recommended operations have a known correctly rounded algorithm, in particular bivariate functions like pow (in fact, pow is the only remaining one at the moment IIRC). Otherwise no implementations would ever be complaint as long as those operations are defined!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's really hard for me to think that this is a good solution. Normal users should be using Float64 (where there is no similar solution), and Float32 should only be used when Float64 computation is too expensive (e.g. GPUs). In such cases, it's hard to believe that doing the math in Float64 and converting will make anyone happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43008048</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I originally wrote this guide for my daughter, then 12 years oldI like the idea of this as an introduction for a child to web development, but I feel like it (in isolation) is wanting. One of the most jarring bits of this page is that there is an almost immediate jump from this page to MDN, which is drastically too much for most 12 year olds. There is a lot of "do this, and then do that" style of instructure, but not very much child-friendly explanation as to why to do that. Most things described here are trivial to people who are familiar with the subject, but not anything obvious or natural or intuitive without the necessary context or experience.Further, there is a significant push into HTML semantics before describing the simplest workflow of creation -&gt; publishing that may lose the target audience's attention; I feel that describing a process more abstractly and then expounding on the details may be more helpful if you're teaching children how to make a website (websites are documents on another computer that you can ask for, this is an example of a very simple document, the document goes on a computer that talks to other computers and responds to their requests for documents, other computers then can see the document when they are responded to, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made this html editor with instant preview and it turned out useful when I show friends how make their very first html page:https://no-gravity.github.io/html_editor/Originally, I made it for myself. To quickly do HTML/CSS/JS experiments. And I still use it for that use case.Often when I show it to non-developer friends, I can see how they light up to coding for the first time. I think it is because it is so accessible. No signup, no setup, no long page load. Everything is instant, and they see each change the moment they type it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really good article - this is the kind of thing I would link to a person that wants to build a website. I'd hate to be a noob developer, and having to learn to build a react site as my very first thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43008315</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author’s experience of replacing a React frontend with a Go-based solution in their project, detailing the motivations behind the switch, which included factors like performance and ease of maintenance. It outlines the challenges faced during the transition, such as the learning curve for Go and the differences in handling state management compared to React. The author highlights the benefits of the new system, including improved speed and reduced complexity, and concludes with reflections on the decision-making process involved in choosing technologies for web development.&lt;/p&gt;

The signup page don't fit in the screen and have empty scrollable space around it. Every click inside the dashboard is a spinner on the whole screen with waiting for page reload. Even icons are showing their alt-texts while loading. These are all smells of just low-experience web application, but it's relieving to say React didn't scale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was slightly worried it would be one of those “render to canvas” frameworks (which are an accessibility nightmare and are ever so slightly broken), but that’s not the case here!

&lt;p&gt;On February 22, 1985, Operation Beluga was launched by the Soviet Union as a secretive mission aimed at gathering intelligence and establishing a presence in the Arctic region. This operation involved extensive planning and coordination among military and research teams to bolster Soviet claims over disputed territories and to enhance surveillance capabilities in the strategically vital area. The article highlights the geopolitical context of the operation, its implications for Cold War dynamics, and its impact on Arctic exploration and territorial claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advancements in Kotlin Multiplatform tooling, highlighting a strategic shift in its development to improve functionality and user experience. It outlines specific updates and features designed to enhance multi-platform project support, streamline workflows, and foster a more robust ecosystem for developers. The piece emphasizes the importance of feedback from the community and sets the stage for future enhancements, reinforcing Kotlin’s commitment to becoming a leading choice for cross-platform development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still don't understand where Jetbrains is going with Fleet. Is it a platform to prototype ideas for their IDEs? Is their long-term goal to replace their IDEs with Fleet? Is it just a standalone product?So far, it seems like they're very slowly recreating their IDEs from scratch in Fleet while continuing development on the IntelliJ Platform and related IDEs, doing twice as much work for nothing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fleet was a strategy to counter vs code. As such it did not work that well. It's not feature complete enough to consider as an intellij alternative and a bit too different for vs code users to take serious. So, easy to see why they are pulling the plug on that.Vs Code of course is the wider ecosystem of plugin compatible editors based on the vs codium platform. This includes a lot of the recent AI editors, and several non vs codium based editors that can integrate the plugins (e.g. vi).The core issue is that Fleet is outside of that ecosystem and doesn't have the community or user adoption to get that fixed. It's a chicken egg problem that's hard to fix. It's being pulled two directions. On one hand you have existing intellij users who use that to do most of their development. And on the other hand you have people that are using vs code and depend on a lot of its plugins. Fleet is a bit of an empty room for both groups of users. None of my more serious projects load correctly in fleet. I've tried it a few times and it's just missing too much stuff for me to take it seriously. And I bet VS Code users would be equally unhappy.Fixing that would involve bringing over the majority of features from intellij and vs code, and recreating those in fleet. Which of course wasn't really happening given that it's being positioned as a closed source platform.IMHO keeping Fleet closed source was the mistake that doomed the whole effort from day 1. In short, they were on their own and not really able to pull that off. Google is understandably focusing on supporting intellij, which at least has an open source core. Providing an open source core for intellij in 2009 was the key enabler that allowed them to move from eclipse to intellij. Google embraded it in 2013. Some of the older people here might remember that Android Studio started out on the Eclipse platform. Eclipse support ended in 2015. Open source is what made that transition possible.Which of course raises the question what the whole point of a closed source Fleet was given that users, plugin developers, and major partners like Google are all focus on the open source ecosystem around intellij. And the rest of the ecosystem is vs code based.Answer: there is none. Hence this foregone conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been long user of JetBrains' products - and love them. I even use ReSharper in Visual Studio (which I still consider better IDE, but for Linux / Mac - JetBrains is my choice, and heck, sometimes even Rider/CLion/RustRover/GoLand on Windows too - especcially GoLand).But... but... I've always wanted (and willing to pay) a single IDE with any plugin that works in it - not just so many different versions...I'm a multiple programming language user - mostly C++, but also Python, Go, Rust, C#, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43015387</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the extensive public weather data provided by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is crucial for creating local weather forecasts accessed through smartphones and TV. It emphasizes that this wealth of data enables accurate and timely predictions that private companies cannot replicate on their own.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;NOAA is a crown jewel of the American experiment. Agencies like this don't exist to turn a profit — they are there to serve the public interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NOAA is fantastic, I was alpine climbing in the very bottom of south america near El Chalten and NOAA is pretty much the only place to get a reliable forecast down there. Fantastic service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm extremely skeptical of the entire premise of DOGE. There are vast changes being made to very large organizations, in very short timespans, with the claim that those making them know what they're doing. But the timespans in question - days to weeks at most - mean that there's no time to review anything. So those making changes do not, cannot, be making decisions based on reviews of available evidence, because they haven't given themselves time to review the evidence. Which in turn means that when they claim they do, they're either delusional or lying.Chesterton's Fence [1] would also seem to apply here, but I mostly think it's not even getting that far. DOGE isn't doing an audit (if it was, there would be auditors, not talented young programmers) and then taking action. DOGE is executing already planned actions, while pretending to be an audit, and helping itself to a great deal of access and data along the way.1. https://theknowledge.io/chestertons-fence-explained/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43018643</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A spokesperson at MongoDB said: "The rise of MongoDB imitators proves our document model is the industry standard. But bolting an API onto a relational database isn't innovation – it's just kicking the complexity can down the road. These 'modern alternatives' come with a built-in sequel: the inevitable second migration when performance, scale, and flexibility hit a wall."I think the reason that a there are so many MongoDB wire compatible projects (like this postgres extension from microsoft, and ferretdb) is because people have systems that have MongoDB clients built into their storage layers but don't want to be running on MongoDB anymore, exactly because "performance, scale, and flexibility hit a wall".If you can change the storage engine, but keep the wire protocol, it makes migrating off Mongo an awful lot cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've said it as a joke many times that PostgreSQL can be a better NoSQL database than many actual NoSQL databases just by creating a (text, JSONB) table.You can do actual searches inside the JSON, index the table with JSONB contents etc. Things that became available in MongoDB very very late.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't see the point of this compared to Postgres' native JSON support.And with things like this in the source https://github.com/microsoft/documentdb/blob/a0c44348fb473da...I'd definitely stay away from it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43012294</guid></item><item><title>46.

The article is talking about Gluons, which apparently are 99% of the mass of the universe.

Because I read this article, and I read the (better, but still lacking) Bloomberg Law article it links/rewrites, and I still have no idea what's happening.The law firm says the surgeon made false claims. (Which claims? Were they false?)The surgeon reacted with some twitter grandstanding saying she was on the side of the women she cares for who are battling cancer. (Noble, but irrelevant. She can tell the truth for a good cause or lie for a good cause. Which did she do?)UHC's spokesperson makes a big show of saying there are "no insurance-related circumstances that would ever require a physician to step out of surgery" and they would "never ask or expect that." Happens all the time actually, in part because if you don't work on the insurance company's schedule and answer their calls, you may not be able to talk to them for weeks, and your patient is denied in the meantime. But is that what was happening here? Apparently nobody thought to ask or include that information.The implication of this news item is that UHC has hired a shakedown operation to chill criticism on social media. Big if true. But it seems to really matter whether the people on either side are telling the truth. Somebody should report that out. Alas, I guess "big company vs plucky surgeon in social media spat" is a simple script that requires no work, we don't need to be curious about who the hero(ine) and the villain are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also discussed on /r/medicine if that piques anyone's curiosity,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1igp35p/follow_up... ("Follow up: The doctor who was pulled out of surgery to call UHC because they were denying her patient’s stay got a threatening letter from UHC for talking about it on social media", 181 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naturally. I'd say they'd be willing to kill to keep their reputation up, but that's already their business model so...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43015713</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Bootstrapping Trust" discusses the challenges and implications of establishing trust in digital environments, particularly in the context of decentralized systems and online interactions. It explores how traditional mechanisms for building trust, such as central authorities and reputation systems, can fall short in modern applications. The author advocates for innovative approaches to bootstrap trust among users by leveraging technology, community engagement, and transparency. Emphasizing the importance of user-centric design and participatory models, the article ultimately aims to inspire discussions on creating more reliable and trustworthy digital spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet even a provider that keeps true to its promise can suffer a security breach and be compromised.2-Party Relay:&gt; This splits “who you are” from “what you do”, meaning neither party can tie your identity to your browsing.Ok, but... don't users have to reply on their provider’s pinky-promise that the two parties won't cooperate with each other and share their separate data, thereby connecting the dots? After all, the two parties are already cooperating to an extent, so why can't they cooperate even more, either voluntarily or at the command of some hostile government?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've found that this decoupling (multi-party) approach is a good way to improve privacy in a bunch of networking contexts -- here's a paper we wrote a few years ago with colleagues at Fastly and Cloudflare on the topic:https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2022/papers/hotnets2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have never seen any of these two-hop designs (which have been increasingly popular recently) explain why--or frankly even mention that!--Tor was/is somehow wrong for believing its three hops is the minimum required number of hops to achieve the goal of anonymity. Without such an explanation, we frankly must assume that these designs are broken out of the gate due to, at bare minimum--without even having to analyze the situation much--the principle of Chesterton's Fence.(Irritatingly, this article does link to an option from Tor's documentation, claiming its design is equivalent to a particular mode of Tor's hidden services... but, in addition to being a feature for the opposite side of the service, said documentation explicitly says that feature is "non-anonymous"; and, even still, includes a dire warning about then reusing the directory? Somehow, this feels worse than merely not contrasting their design to Tor at all, as most of these designs seem to do.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43016574</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge" provides a comprehensive overview of the ImageNet competition, focusing on its impact on the field of computer vision and deep learning. It discusses the dataset's development, the challenges faced by participants, and the advancements in image classification and object detection techniques that emerged as a result of the competition. The authors highlight various algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and emphasize the significant improvements in performance metrics, ultimately showcasing how the challenge catalyzed research and innovation within the AI community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The proliferation of harmful AI capabilities has likely already occurred. Its naive to not accept this reality when tackling this.  A more realistic approach would be to focus on building more robust systems for detection, attribution, and harm mitigation.The paper makes some good points - it doesn't take a lot of data to convincingly emulate a writing style (~75 emails) and there is a significant gap in legislation as most US "deepfake" legislation explicitly excludes text and focuses heavily on image/video/audio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have the dread that in a relatively short amount of time
the personal traits in peoples writing will over time decrease
and may essentially end.All our written interaction will have been polished and enhanced
by one LLM or another into a uniform template.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess there's 3 players in the games that often get invoked in discussions about AI cogsec:- the corporation running the AI- the user- the AI, sometimes - depending on the particular conversation's ascription of agency to the AIIt seems the downstream harms are of 2 kinds:- social engineering to give up otherwise secured systems- 'people engineering' - the kind of thing people complain about when it comes to recommender systems. "Mind control", basically, y'know. [0]Things like r/LocalLlama and the general "tinkerer" environment of open source AI makes me wonder if it wouldn't be rather trivial in some sense for users to build the same capabilities but for personal protection from malign influences. Like a kind of user-controlled "debrief AI". But then, of course, you might get a superintelligence that can pretend to be your friend but is actually more like Iago from Othello.But is that really a likelihood in a situation where the user can make their own RLHF dataset and fit it to the desired behavior? Generally I'd expect the user to get the behavior they were looking for. Plus, like immune system memory, people could continually train new examples of sleights into it. I guess maybe there could be a hint of the "Waluigi problem", perhaps.[0] I think it does the people who are distressed about it a disservice to saturate all their news channels with reports about how they are utterly incapable of outwitting an algorithmic super intelligence. But that's a different discussion altogether&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43014573</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository titled "Doom on Google Sheets" showcases a creative project that enables users to play the classic video game Doom directly within a Google Sheets document. The project utilizes Google Apps Script to integrate the game mechanics into the spreadsheet interface, allowing gameplay through cell manipulation. The repository includes instructions for setup, gameplay controls, and an overview of the project’s development process, making it accessible for both casual gamers and programming enthusiasts interested in exploring the intersection of gaming and spreadsheet applications.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm sure there is a way to actually run frame-by-frame Doom with only cell equations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't ever looked into these Doom emulators, but at this point my impression is that Doom is some kind of natural and inevitable epiphenomenon that can be provoked in any computing environment with just a little prodding.Like a rainbow from sunlight, Doom is always already there once you set up a few nand gates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Google Sheets does not support true color rendering.True color just means you're not indexing your colors with a pallete.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent leak of YouTube users' email addresses, primarily affecting content creators and viewers. It outlines the implications of the breach, highlighting concerns over privacy and potential phishing attacks. The piece also emphasizes the importance of protecting personal information online and advises users to enable two-factor authentication and review privacy settings to safeguard their accounts from similar incidents in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

For those who didn't make it toward the end of the article: the leaked emails didn't cost them anything (except their time and ingenuity), and they received 10k as the bug bounty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Here's a POC of the exploit in action: This video has been removed for violating YouTube's Terms of ServiceThat's hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see a lot of noise made about responsible disclosure, its drivers, and its rewards.  What I don't see is talk about how this is one more datapoint against centralized permanent identities.Every time I see a service purporting that it works best only with a single link to your Real Identity™, I'm reminded that the vendors only abstractly care about actually protecting the user, and then only sometimes.Imagine being able get immediately three or four steps closer to doxing anyone interacting on YouTube.  That's the actual impact of this bug IMO.  It's good that this was fixed, but I don't think this class of bug goes away anytime soon.  What do we need to do to get vendors and big companies to realize that this sort of design is landmines waiting to happen?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43024221</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Year I Didn't Survive" by Bess Stillman reflects on the author's personal struggles and mental health challenges experienced during a particularly difficult year. Stillman candidly discusses her feelings of despair, the impact of these struggles on her daily life, and the journey toward healing and self-acceptance. She emphasizes the importance of seeking help, the complexities of mental health, and the resilience required to navigate such hardships. The piece ultimately serves as an exploration of vulnerability, growth, and the ongoing process of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My son had cancer during COVID, though he was fortunate enough to beat it into remission (with the help of a huge care team).I was active duty military, and he is also non-verbal and autistic.The things she talks about, how focused she was and how hard it is to do any of that now, I've been experiencing exactly the same things. I find it hard to do anything, put anything together, etc. after 3 years of managing his care closely, being at his bedside all hours, having to scream at nurses to call away a code because he couldn't breathe (anaphylaxis), and a ton of other things. All of this while working 50+ hours a week, including remotely from his bedside.It's like I burnt out that part of me. Maybe I'm slowly healing? But I don't feel like it. I get minutes or hours when I can hit that stride again and it's absolutely terrifying to realize that I can no longer keep it up.I don't know that this comment adds anything to her story. I just felt like I understood her on a level that's hard to communicate and had the urge to share that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sisyphean is the word I’ve come back to a lot myself since my wife took her life on November 6, 2024. Feeling like I’m now trying to live for both of us, grasping at ways of honouring her memory despite the incredible love we had being unable to “save” her, and somehow not at all myself anymore, but having to keep moving forward feels hopeless beyond belief.I lost my dad suddenly just two months prior, and my grandma shortly before that, but the loss of your partner (and in this manner after she refused help and I watched helplessly as she spiralled in her last year) eclipses any grief or pain I had experienced before or could have even imagined.But I wanted to show a little appreciation for the OP and others on here sharing their devastating losses. Knowing love inevitably turns into grief but that that is a more universal experience makes me feel a little less alone. Small blessings but at points like these, we take whatever morsels we can get.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's weird how a series of big things happening in a short period of time changes who you are as a person, and not always for the better.When I failed to stop an acquaintance from killing himself a few years ago [1], it really fucked me up. I barely knew the guy, but I couldn't stop myself from feeling guilty over it, and I still have nightmares about it.It led to a severe funk of depression that I still haven't gotten over, and it's led to poor sleep, poor performance at work, an increased irritability towards pretty much everyone, and I'm not completely convinced that that will ever stop.I've seen therapists, taken various medications for depression and PTSD, trauma dumped onto pretty much anyone who will listen, and I think I'm a worse person now than I was in 2021.I guess the likelihood of an event like this happening approaches 1 as you get older, but it doesn't mean it's not terrible.[1] Written in some detail here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29185822&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43020983</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I have been authoring the various Drive Stats reports for the past ten years and this will be my last one. I am retiring, or perhaps in Drive Stats vernacular, it would be “migrating.”Thank you for all these reports over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not a best practice, but the last 10 years I've run my home server with a smaller faster drive for the OS and a single larger disk for bulk storage that I choose using Backblaze Drive Stats. None of have failed yet (fingers-crossed). I really trust their methodology and it's an extremely valuable resource for me as a consumer.My most recent drive is a WDC WUH722222ALE6L4 22TiB, and looking at the stats (albeit only a few months of data), and overall trend of WDC, in this report gives me peace of mind that it should be fine for the next few years until it's time for the cycle to repeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've owned 17 Seagate ST12000NM001G (12TB SATA) drives over the last 24mos in a big raidz3 pool. My personal stats, grouping by the first 3-4 SN characters:
- 5/8 ZLW2s failed
- 1/4 ZL2s
- 1/2 ZS80
- 0/2 ZTN
- 0/1 ZLW0
All drives were refurbs. Two from the Seagate eBay store, all others from ServerPartDeals. 7/15 of the drives I purchases from ServerPartDeals have failed, at least four of those failures have been within 6 weeks of installation.I originally used the Backblaze when selecting the drive I'd build my storage pool around. Every time the updated stats pop up in my inbox, I check out the table and double-check that my drives are in fact the 001Gs.. the drives that Backblaze reports has having 0.99% AFR.. I guess the lesson is that YMMV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43013431</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel method for covertly transmitting arbitrary data using emojis as carriers. It delves into the technical aspects of this "smuggling" technique, where different combinations of emojis can encode information, potentially circumventing traditional data transmission protocols. The author provides insights on the implications for data privacy and security, highlighting both the innovative nature of this approach and its potential applications in communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 years or so ago I shocked coworkers with using U+202D LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE mid in filenames on windows. So funnypicturegnp.exe became funnypictureexe.png
Combined with a custom icon for the program that mimics a picture preview it was pretty convincing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to abusing Unicode!  You can use a similar technique to this to overflow the buffer on loads of systems that accept Unicode strings.  Normally it just produces an error and/or a crash but sometimes you get lucky and it'll do all sorts of fun things! :)I remember doing penetration testing waaaaaay back in the day (before Python 3 existed) and using mere diacritics to turn a single character into many bytes that would then overflow the buffer of a back-end web server.  This only ever caused it to crash (and usually auto-restart) but I could definitely see how this could be used to exploit certain systems/software with enough fiddling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cute but unnecessary - Unicode includes a massive range called PUA: the private use area. The codes in this range aren’t mapped to anything (and won’t be mapped to anything) and are for internal/custom use, not to be passed to external systems (for example, we use them in fish-shell to safely parse tokens into a string, turning an unescaped special character into just another Unicode code point in the string, but in the PUA area, then intercept that later in the pipeline).You’re not supposed to expose them outside your api boundary but when you encounter them you are prescribed to pass them through as-is, and that’s what most systems and libraries do. It’s a clear potential exfiltration avenue, but given that most sane developers don’t know much more about Unicode other than “always use Unicode to avoid internationalization issues”, it’s often left wide open.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023508</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a summit where representatives from various countries convened to address AI safety and regulations. Notably, the United States and the United Kingdom declined to sign a proposed AI safety declaration aimed at establishing global standards for responsible AI development and use. The refusal is attributed to concerns over the implications for innovation and national security. The summit highlighted differing priorities among nations regarding AI governance, emphasizing the challenges of reaching a consensus on safety measures in this rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;

Like yes, we are able to think of thousands of hypothetical ways technology (even those inferior to full AGI) could go off the rails in a catastrophic way and post and discuss these scenarios endlessly... and yet it doesn't result in a slowing or stopping of the progress leading there. All it takes is a single group with enough collective intelligence and breakthroughs and the next AI will be delivered to our doorstop whether or not we asked for it.It reminds me of the time I read books in my youth and only 20 years later realized the authors of some of those books were trying to deliver a important life messages to a teenager undergoing crucial changes, all of which would be painfully relevant to the current adult me... and yet the whole time they fell on deaf ears. Like the message was right there but I did not have the emotional/perceptive intelligence to pick up on and internalize it for too long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI isn't like nuclear fission.  You can't remotely detect that somebody is training an AI.  It's far too late to sequester all the information related to AI like what was done with uranium enrichment.  The equipment needed to train AI is cheap and ubiquitous.These "safety declarations" are toothless and impossible to enforce.  You can't stop AI, you need to adapt.  Video and pictures will soon have no evidentiary value.  Real life relationships must be valued over online relationships because you know the other person is real.  It's unfortunate, but nothing AI is "disrupting" existed 200 years ago and people will learn to adapt like they always have.To quote the fictional comic book villain Toyo Harada, "none of you can stop me.  Not any one of you individually nor the whole of you collectively."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All this "AI safety" is purely moat-building for the likes of OpenAI et. al. to prevent upstarts like DeepSeek.LLMs will not get us to AGI.  Not even close. Altman talking about this danger is like Musk talking about driverless taxis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023554</guid></item><item><title>6.

Just added it to my "Postgres Is Enough" gist:https://gist.github.com/cpursley/c8fb81fe8a7e5df038158bdfe0f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; OpenAI helper: If you have an OpenAI account, the interface can query OpenAI to help you understand your query plan and optimize your SQL queriesHow good are LLMs at optimizing queries? Do they just give basic advices like "try adding an index there" or can they do more?I guess it would need to cross the results of the explain analyze with at least the DDLs of the table (including partitions, indexes, triggers, etc), and like the sizes of the tables and the rate of reads/writes of the tables in some cases, to be able to "understand" and "reason" about what's going on and offer meaningful advices (e.g. proposing design changes for the tables).I don't see how a generic LLM would be able to do that, but maybe another type of model trained for this task and with access to all the information it needs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The screenshot section in the README seems to be empty.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Prophet of Parking" explores the life and ideas of a prominent figure in urban planning who advocates for innovative approaches to parking management. It highlights the impact of effective parking solutions on city design, traffic flow, and the environment. The piece delves into the complexities of parking policies and their implications for urban development, emphasizing the need for a shift in perspective to create more sustainable and accessible urban spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite excerpt, where rationale overcomes ideology:&gt; Indeed, Shoup worked hard to make his ideas palatable across the political spectrum. Are you a conservative? People should pay for the services they consume. Are you a progressive? All this unnecessary driving can’t be good for the environment. Are you a libertarian? Clearly, the solution to scarcity is prices and markets. Are you a socialist? Let’s stop privatizing the public realm by turning it into a free parking lot. As a result, the typical shoupista gathering is an oasis of peaceful coexistence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oregon eliminated burdensome parking regulations in most larger cities and: it's fine.Many home builders still add parking to new projects because there is market demand for it - and they are also competing for tenants or buyers against existing housing which has parking.But there is now the flexibility to do some projects without parking, which really helps at the affordable end of the spectrum, and is a good fit for more walkable locations.BTW, Nolan Gray, cited as the author, has a book out himself that's really approachable and good reading if you're interested in cities: https://islandpress.org/books/arbitrary-lines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny (and sad) to me that people who are familiar with congestion-solving pricing schemes for something like AWS services act so unable to see parking and road networks as containing the same dynamics.I'm working on solving the problem because my life is actively being ruined by mismanaged parking.I think low enough of my own skills and capacities, and yet.https://josh.works/parkingUnfortunately 'parking' is just a component of a larger mobility network that, in America, is mismanaged to better accomplish ethnic cleansing. I wish I were kidding, I wish I were wrong.A book has been written titled: 'the slaughter of cities: urban renewal as ethnic cleansing'It sorta ruined my ability to function as peacefully as before in segments of society common in the greater united states.Edit: the 2nd of Donald shoup's 3 part fix was 'spend all collected money on the curb where it's collected'.This piece, mixed with the proper clearing price for maintaining a 10% availability of parking spaces means parking could possibly provide for really substantial and beautiful upgrades to the area.Feels like lots of times the conversation forgets that beautiful things will be added if parking gets managed rightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43026920</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical significance and revival of punch card knitting, a technique that utilizes perforated cards to control knitting machines, allowing for complex patterns. It highlights how this method was once prevalent but has diminished over time due to changes in technology and craft practices. The piece emphasizes efforts to preserve this vanishing culture through archiving and education, showcasing the intersection of technology, art, and tradition in textile arts, and calling attention to the importance of keeping such craft histories alive for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently bought an old Brother knitting machine (KH940) which is electronic but with a community of hackers adding third-party firmware and hardware on it [0]. There are also lots of models that read punch cards [1] and knit that purely mechanically (and later models electronically). They are a marvel of engineering that has essentially died out, only Silver Reed and Taitexma produce new models as far as I'm aware and they are often not as featureful as the old machines (SR has no garter carriages that Brother machines had 40 years ago for example).[0]: http://www.ayab-knitting.com/
[1]: https://alessandrina.com/2015/09/03/brother-kms-punchcards-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A long time ago, I remember hearing about some castle or manor house or something like that which was being restored. There was a set of custom rugs, which, while intact, were badly faded. Somehow, they still had the original set of punch cards on hand that ran the looms, and though the machines were long gone, they were able to figure out the pattern and have a complete new set of rugs made, 100+ years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My local public library owns a computerized version of one of these, and I've been itching for a chance to use it for a full-scale project.That said, based on my small amount of experimenting with it, I have to say I'm not surprised that the home models are hard to find anymore. They're a relic of a bygone era when home knitting was a means to an end, so having a tool to help you get to a specific practical outcome much more quickly was something a lot of people would be interested in already. And that, in turn, creates an opportunity to make products for the subset of that subset of people who still want to make it fancy.But most knitters nowadays do it because they enjoy the physical process of knitting by hand. So tools like this arguably defeat the purpose of the hobby for a lot of people. The only person I've met who had any interest in actually owning one (instead of getting to play with someone else's, as I want to do) was a visual artist who happened to use textile as one of her media.And now, in the Internet age, there are online services such Wildemasche that will do custom jacquard knits for you. Just upload a file with your pattern and they'll take care of the rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43024540</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely amazing game. In my personal circle, literally everybody and their family had either played the game or at the least knew the main themes of the music. IIR it was also a bit cheaper than many other games.I personally think the bizarre setting, art design, and great soundtrack (perhaps a top-3 ever in gaming) did a lot to overcome a lot of the awkwardness of the gameplay. It was an experience you wanted to have, it was original, and the concept was almost 80's arcade pure. The ambience provided the reason to want to be there.If you were to reframe the game without those things, I'm not entirely sure it holds up as well.But 20+ years later I can walk into a room with my friends, start whistling the theme and everybody will join in.What a joyful game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked this quote:&gt; I worked on the basic concept on my own. I found that if I started to listen to others, the concept tended to become diluted and unfocused. However, once the basic concept was decided, it was helpful to have open discussions with the team. There were many more ideas that were not used in the game, but I still got something out of all the different ideas that were brought up even if I didn't use them as they were presented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Originally, I wanted to eliminate the time limit and let the player simply roll the katamari to make it bigger. But, I couldn't figure out how to make the game fun without a time limitBetter level design (than in the original Katamari Damacy) is the answer. See Carmageddon as an example. Despite having a time limit and technically being in a race against other drivers, you can just go off course and explore the level, picking time bonuses as you do that. It's fun because the levels are full of secret areas and there's always something to explore. The other drivers are just dumb enough to not be a problem, and will also go off course if you do. Or you can play it as a racing game and ignore all that, no problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43015585</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most interesting part to me was this: "He’d been telling a version of that same story every single day for months and months during development—to us, to his friends, his family. He was constantly working on it, refining it. Every time he’d get a puzzled look or a request for clarification from his unwitting early audience, he’d sand it down, tweak it slightly, until it was perfectly polished."I did the same thing for 12 years as CEO of Postmates and I still do it when I work on new ideas. I thought it was something I just did. But reading this I have to assume it is more common.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always am skeptical about this idea that "great marketers make great products". I mean of course marketing is important to sell stuff, and of course people want to think that they have a major contribution into the success of their company, but...Take the iPhone. My first iPhone was a 3G. I did not buy it because Steve Jobs convinced me: I bought it because a friend had one, I tried it and it was actually pretty cool. I had tried a PDA before, and did not feel like buying one. No storytelling there, just a product that was a better fit at a better time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "An iPod, a phone…are you getting it?"Honestly, the response from the audience in the hall seemed to suggest we were not getting it. We were expecting multiple devices.Fortunately Jobs delivered the punchline quickly then and moved on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990103</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of scraping data from League of Legends, specifically focusing on obtaining match and player statistics. It provides insights into the tools and libraries used for web scraping, including Python and Beautiful Soup, and outlines the challenges faced during the scraping process, such as navigating through HTML structures and API limitations. Additionally, it highlights the importance of ethical considerations and data usage in game analysis, providing a guide for aspiring data analysts in the gaming field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on something like this back in 2016, I'm not sure how much things have changed since then. I used dynamic binary instrumentation to deal with the field encryption. Basically, manually map the executable into executable memory on Linux (as if it were a shared library). Begin execution at the packet switch, but before executing a block of code, disassemble it until a conditional branch, and modify it according to some heuristics to remove the at rest encryption. The original block of code wasn't executed since it might not fit into the original block size, so new blocks were mmap'd for this. Malloc/Free were hooked and replaced with wrappers over glibc's free/malloc, but with bookkeeping so that the memory can be freed after execution of the packet switch. atexit was just replaced with a noop. That all just dealt with the encryption, but there were also randomized packet id's and field orders. Those problems were dealt with by using manually written heuristics based on the packet id's which were actually interesting. Packet handlers with references to text strings (even hashed ones), etc were a gold mine here because they made static detection of packet id's simple. If there was no text string, many of the offsets could be auto detected just by parsing a replay and running small snippets to determine which offsets actually "made sense" for the field that was being searched for. For example, if there was a gold gain packet, the amount of gold gained shouldn't be out of an expected range, or else the offset is likely not corresponding to that field. Once all of the high volume code blocks had been instrumented, replays were able to be parsed in 2-3 seconds (along with generating the desired data aggregations). This is all from memory so it's possible there could be a minor mistake or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always heard that "security through obscurity" is discouraged because, well, there's no stopping someone from digging in and figuring it out. However in this case it seems somewhat successful in that the author was not able to decrypt the packets directly.The article says that "while it might seem feasible to reimplement these functions in Python without running the client, several factors make this approach impractical" and then lists some reasons like the lookup tables changing, chunk layouts getting shuffled, etc.Is that all it takes to thwart decrypting the packets? Even though, presumably, you have access to all those lookup tables and chunk layouts somewhere in the client? Is it just too much effort to piece together how it works? I'd be curious to hear more specifics on how exactly Riot was able to make reverse engineering this so impractical.Great article!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really something cool, and it is exactly what I was looking for. To give a context, I worked on some data science-inspired studies [1] about LoL, and the future research direction is to provide a formal modeling for the games and analyze them through it. While I had a little success by getting aggregated data from websites such as uol.gg, the granularity is not fine enough to do very interesting analysis.[1] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103516&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43024173</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took a few tries, but I got Wolfram Alpha to compute its velocity compared to the speed of light[1].I started with:    sqrt(1-((1/(1+120 PeV / (neutrino mass * c^2)))^2))

but it simply said "data not available". So I changed:    120 PeV to 120e15 * 1.602176634e-19 kg m^2 s^-2
    neutrino mass to 1.25e-37kg
    speed of light to 299792458 m/s

and finally it gave a numeric result:    0.999999999999999999999999999999999999829277971

(that's 36 nines in a row). Pasting it in Google says the value is "1", which is… not far off.If you want details about the way this is calculated, I dug up the formula from an article I'd written about particle velocities in the LHC, back in 2008[2]. For comparison, their 7 TeV protons were going at 0.999999991 × c.[1] https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sqrt%281-%28%281%2F%281...[2] https://log.kv.io/post/2008/09/12/lhc-how-fast-do-these-prot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ars Technica has an article, as well, with some additional context/explanation.https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/most-energetic-neutr...And an interesting, somewhat related, video from PBS Space Time exploring how supernovas act as particle accelerators (but don't quite explain particles like this one or the 'Oh My God' particle):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sSNWIJbV3Q&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article references the "Oh-My-God particle, the most energetic particle yet encountered.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never made anything fancy, but I never made anything for the web that I can't run locally. If I can't just sync the changed files to the web server and overwrite the DB (which for my use cases takes seconds), I'm not interested. If it needs to be in the domain root, I'm not interested. A bunch of files using relative paths and a config that checks for running on localhost and points to the local DB or the production one, respectively. That's it (okay plus the domain and a few other things so cookies etc. work, but describing it would take longer than making it), that's all I want out of the web kthxbai. I'm basically stuck in 2000 and I love it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From something I wrote in 2021 [0] and based on my experience working on a "browser-based OS" in 2013:    What we need is to have a device-transparent way to see our *data*. We got so used to the idea that web applications let us work from "dumb terminals" that we failed to realize that *there is no such thing as a dumb terminal anymore*. With multi-core smartphones, many of them with 4, 8, 12, 16GB of RAM; it's not too hard to notice that the actual bottlenecks in mobile devices are battery life and (intermittent and still relatively expensive) network connectivity. These are problems that can be solved by appropriate data synchronization, not by removing the data from the edge. 

    One of the early jokes about web2.0 was that to have a successful company you should take an Unix utility and turn it into a web app. This generation of open source developers are reacting to this by looking at successful companies and building "self-hosted" versions of these web apps. What they didn't seem to realize is that **we don't need them**. The utlities and the applications still work just fine, we just need to manage the data and how to sync between our mobile/edge devices and our main data storage. 

    If you are an open source developer and you are thinking of creating a web app, do us all a favor and ask yourself first: do I need to create yet-another silo or can I solve this with Syncthing?

[0]: https://raphael.lullis.net/thinking-heads-are-not-in-the-clo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the localfirst idea but I don't love web browsers. They're the platform everyone has to have but shoehorning 40 years of UI development and products into them seems like a mistake.I can see why local UI development fell out of favor, but it is still better (faster, established tooling, computers already have it so you don't have to download it). I can't help but feel like a lighter weight VM (versus electron) is what we actually want. Or at least what _I_ want, something like UXN but just a little more fully featured.I'm writing some personal stuff for DOS now with the idea that every platform has an established DOS emulator and the development environment is decent. Don't get me wrong this is probably totally crazy and a dead end but it's fun for now. But a universally available emulator of a bare bones simple machine could solve many computing problems at once so the idea is tempting. To use DOS as that emulator is maybe crazy but it's widely available and self-hosting. But to make networked applications advancing the state of emulators like DOSBox would be critical.Actually local first, maybe the way forward is first to take a step back. What were we trying to accomplish again? What are computers for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021677</guid></item><item><title>14. 5G networks meet consumer needs as mobile data growth slows</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bandwidth</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For VoIP applications, one-way mouth-to-ear delay should ideally be less than 150 ms for natural conversations [1].Other factors, such as jitter, transmission delay, queuing delay, etc., also impact quality. However, if the delay occurs mid-transmission (e.g., due to network congestion or routing inefficiencies), there’s little that can be done beyond optimizing at the endpoints.[1] https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Latency_(audio)#Telepho...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK so someone has noticed that you "only" need 15MBs-1 for a 4K stream.  Jolly good.Now let's address latency - that entire article only mentioned the word once and it looks like it was by accident.Latency isn't cool but it is why your Teams/Zoom/whatevs call sounds a bit odd.  You are probably used to the weird over-talking episodes you get when a sound stream goes somewhat async.  You put up with it but you really should not, with modern gear and connectivity.A decent quality sound stream consumes roughly 256KBs-1 (yes: 1/4 megabyte per second - not much) but if latency strays away from around 30ms, you'll notice it and when it becomes about a second it will really get on your nerves.  To be honest, half a second is quite annoying.I can easily measure path latency to a random external system with ping to get a base measurement for my internet connection and here it is about 10ms to Quad9.  I am on wifi and my connection goes through two switches and a router and a DSL FTTC modem.  That leaves at least 20ms (which is luxury) for processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Could maximum data speeds—on mobile devices, at home, at work—be approaching “fast enough” for most people for most purposes?That seems to be the theme across all consumer electronics as well. For an average person mid phones are good enough, bargain bin laptops are good enough, almost any TV you can buy today is good enough. People may of course desire higher quality and specific segments will have higher needs, but things being enough may be a problem for tech and infra companies in the next decade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43027266</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW, if you're like me and have been wanting to target WASM bytecode directly for ages without any of the heavy existing toolchains, but unable to put the separate pieces of the spec together yourself: the core maintainer of this library is co-authoring a book for that[0]. I decided to take the risk of giving the early access version a try and it's really nice and accessible.I'm mentioning it because it implements a toy language using Ohm to explain how WebAssembly works (gee wonder why). So it actually includes a mini-Ohm tutorial.Funny enough, since WASM bytecode is designed to be compact, and speccing out parsers tends to be a more verbose business, the book technically ends up spending more words on implementing the parser than on WASM itself (all with the goal of developing a mental model for WASM though, which it succeeded at for me so this is not a critique).[0] https://wasmgroundup.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm particularly impressed with the visual PEG debugger tool, here: https://ohmjs.org/editorPEGs are extremely difficult to debug when things go wrong because you get a MASSIVE trace (if you're lucky) to sift through.  This tool has rewind/playback controls to dig into what the PEG rules are doing.Previously, the best I'd seen was cpp-peglib's online parser, here: https://yhirose.github.io/cpp-peglib/Edit: and now having read through comments here, Chevrotain's PEG tool looks really impressive, although it doesn't use a simple PEG syntax for the input: https://chevrotain.io/playground/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am jealous of kids these days learning the theory of parsing. There are so many great resources out there! Ohm in particular looks great, attention to detail, care for the theory. Makes me wish I had a project to try it out.I am a big fan of PEG parsers. They do come with their set issues and difficulties but I always found them great to work with. My to go tool (also a PEG parser similar to Ohm) used to be pegjs now https://peggyjs.org/When I needed speed, or a more classical take, I would use jison. But I think today I would have to find a good reason not to build a hand made parser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42982755</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an Analogue Pocket, which works really well, but the fact that it uses an FPGA is essentially meaningless to me. Is there really any significant difference compared to software emulation?I know how they're different, I understand the mechanics of it, I just don't understand why it's not possible to make a software emulation that is as good as FPGA emulation. Or maybe it is possible. I always felt like doing it in software would be a lot more flexible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool, thanks for the writeup. Love how thorough you were, one of my first thoughts was whether you could hook it up to a gamecube and it was already done in the blog post :).One cool advantage of real cartridge compatibility I hadn't really thought about is that lets you not have to think about memory mappers (I'm mostly familiar with NES's dozens of different mappers, not sure if GB carts work the same way) and other custom cartridge hardware since you're just "emulating" up to the cartridge boundary. I guess this means even crazier hardware like the camera/rumble/sewing machine would "just work" with an original cartridge without any special support right?I guess that doesn't save too much for this though if it supports loading ROMs. For that do you still end up having to emulate all the different mappers in the FPGA?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you for the nice project and write-up! I love stuff like this!I visited the comments earlier and was discouraged to find that most of them were of the flavor of, "why does this exist?" From people who have obviously never attempted 1% of an audacious project like this. It exists because it's cool sure looked to be a fun cross-domain learning experience, like what else do you need?BTW, I have submitted to Hack-A-Day's tip line so don't be surprised in there's an article there about it in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43027335</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intersection of data visualization and art, emphasizing the importance of aesthetic presentation in enhancing the understanding of complex information. It explores various techniques and methods for effectively visualizing data, highlighting how visual representations can communicate insights more clearly and engagingly than raw numbers alone. The piece also reflects on the creative aspect of data visualization, encouraging practitioners to blend artistic principles with analytical skills to create compelling and informative visual narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; And creating art is about more than just precision. It's about evoking emotion, telling stories, and sparking curiosity. It's about making people think and feel.For sure, the best artists are the ones who take their whole perception of stuff, with the feelings and everything else, and put it directly in someone else's brain. I would maybe say that some data visualization is supposed to do that, particularly data journalism, but definitely not all data visualization.I think not all data visualization is art in the same sense that not all writing is literature, and in fact almost all isn't, because it's more like "I am in a shared info network with my boss/colleagues/clients/readers, and we need to communicate as rapidly and directly as possible, so we've agreed on a shared visual language that is higher bandwidth." Emails are slightly less exciting to read than a novel but like a million times faster to write per word.Which is kind of sad. It would be fun to hone that skill and there is no room for that at my job.(Side note, it seems like everyone always says that the pie chart problem is about lengths vs angles... but isn't it just that one chart has a shared baseline and the other doesn't? Taking the middle out [donut chart] to emphasize arc length doesn't actually solve the problem. Conversely, a stacked bar is more like a pie chart than a bar chart, except with a weird aspect ratio if you only have one stacked bar).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the rise of the generative AI backlash, I once saw a take along the lines of "data visualization doesn't count as art because you write it with code: art only counts if you put sweat and tears and labor into it."I was too baffled to respond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the framing of data visualization as a balance of trade-offs. It's not just about picking the "best" chart type, it's about knowing why you're making the choices you are&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43025645</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emerging trend of launching satellites into very low Earth orbits (VLEO) to enhance global internet coverage and improve data transmission speed. It highlights the technological advancements that make these lower orbits feasible, such as reduced latency and increased efficiency. The piece also addresses the challenges associated with VLEO, including issues with satellite functionality due to atmospheric drag and the need for innovative designs to manage these obstacles. Furthermore, it explores the competitive landscape among companies willing to invest in this new frontier of satellite technology, aiming for faster and more reliable communication networks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort of like a Bussard ramjet, but using solar power rather than nuclear fusion.Something that bothered me, until I looked up some numbers: the air a VLEO satellite scoops up is presumably more or less at rest wrt the Earth below it--there could be wind and effects of the Earth's magnetic field, and so forth, but for practical purposes it would be coming at the VLEO satellite at about 18,000 mph, or 8 km/s.  In order to produce thrust, it has to exit the back of the satellite at a significantly higher speed.  It turns out that ion thrusters have an exit speed of 20--50 km/s.  So I guess it's feasible.More info in this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere-breathing_electric_... --which says the exit speed of this kind of ion thruster is 55 km/s (as tested in a vacuum chamber).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "The other major application of being in VLEO is that you are closer to the ground for communications. That is particularly useful for space internet services, like SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently beams the internet to receivers on the ground from higher orbits. By using lower satellites in VLEO, the antennas can act like mobile phone towers and beam the internet straight to your phone. "Going direct to a cell phone is a challenging task to do from space," says Tim Farrar, a satellite communications expert in California. "These lower [orbits] could enable a direct-to-cell constellation."Starlink direct-to-cell satellites are already in a VLEO orbit shell, distinct from the rest of the constellation. They use electric propulsion (like all Starlinks) to counter drag, though it is not air-breathing electric propulsion (the theme of the OP).- "The higher luminosity of these DTCs compared to regular Starlinks is partly because they circle Earth at just 217 miles (350 kilometers) above the surface, which is lower than traditional Starlink internet satellites, whose altitude is 340 miles (550 kilometers), the study reported. [...] There are now over 100 DTC satellites in low Earth orbit, including 13 that were launched last week. Following successful testing of the first batch of DTCs, in March SpaceX requested an amendment to their license with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that would allow them to operate up to 7,500 DTCs in LEO."https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-direct-to-cell-satelli...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why not just a large constellation of weather balloons with a satellite payload? You have to deal with wind patterns, but that's probably a solvable problem with enough of them. Much cheaper to launch and they don't regularly and necessarily burn to ashes!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991062</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential of WebAssembly (Wasm) to supplant traditional container technology in software development and deployment. It highlights Wasm's efficiency and speed, enabling applications to run directly in web browsers and on various platforms without extensive overhead. The author argues that as Wasm evolves, it could alleviate some limitations of containers, such as resource usage and complexity in orchestration, ultimately leading to a more streamlined approach for developers. The post also examines current trends and use cases where Wasm may offer distinct advantages over containers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The main thing holding back wider adoption is a lack of system interfaces. File access, networking, etc. But it's just a matter of time before these features get integrated."But then you've got to figure out and prevent all the security holes that can be introduced by adding file access, networking, etc. That's what killed the Java write-once, run-anywhere promise. Maybe put the whole thing into a container? Oops, looks like the container wasn't replaced after all (though perhaps it could be simplified).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WASM solves a different problem to containers. Where WASM does well is in running sandboxed code efficiently, because that's where it started out. I think WASM will likely take over as the standard for shipping things like Functions-as-a-Service implementations, and other forms of plugins, where one host application/server of some kind wants to efficiently run pieces of untrusted logic.Containers don't solve that problem. They aren't a particularly good security boundary, and they are much heavier weight, in terms of bytes and startup costs, than WASM binaries, because they are deeply integrated into the OS for networking, etc. However, when what you need to do is ship a binary with a bunch of accoutrements, dependencies, files, etc, and then run multiple processes, multiple threads, and use more of the OS primitives, containers are an ergonomic way to do that, and that suits Infrastructure-as-a-Service much more closely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; WebAssembly is a true write-once-run-anywhere experience. (Anywhere that can spin up a V8 engine, which is a lot of places these days.)This is true if your wasm code is purely computational, but if it interacts with the outside world it’s a different story. Each V8 runtime has a subtly different interface, so code that runs on cloudflare V8 might not run in Bun or Deno. Not to mention if you want to support WASI too, which is a different set of bindings even though it’s still WebAssembly.Love or hate Docker, part of its success was that POSIX was already a fairly established standard and there weren’t a lot of vendors driving it in different directions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43020684</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I don't use DeaDBeeF as my primary music player anymore, back when I did, I wrote a plugin for using VgmStream with DeaDBeeF around 10 years ago, so I could more easily listen to video game soundtracks directly from the game files. For whatever reason, I have continued to maintain said plugin despite that I only use DeaDBeeF to test updates to it.It's not on the plugins list because I haven't bothered trying to get it there. I don't think that list existed when I wrote this. I approached the author about upstreaming it instead, thinking it would be a good compliment to the builtin Game_Music_Emu plugin for emulating various old video game and computer audio chips. They seemed a bit upset that people didn't want to maintain external plugins, but actually I didn't really mind doing so. Maybe I should look into getting it on that list some day.Either way, if streamed video game music formats are up your alley and you like DeaDBeeF, then shameless plug: https://github.com/jchv/deadbeef-vgmstream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other fun music players:- https://foobar2000.org- https://volumio.org- http://rhythmbox.org- https://amarok.kde.org- https://cmus.github.io- https://museeks.io- https://fooyin.org- https://audacious-media-player.org- https://www.clementine-player.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels like music players are becoming a thing for old geezers, like everything that requires you to have your data on a local disk.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "sustainability makeover" reads like it can in principle be recycled, and if we really want to we can make it from plants (though we likely wouldn't).I don't have access to the full paper, but "Flexible and soft, the resulting material can be completely chemically recycled using heat and degraded by acid" doesn't inspire confidence that it would actually degrade well in nature. At least from that short description it does at least sound economically viable for deliberate recycling. At least with the right incentives.They call it "bio-sourced material". Now I don't have a chemistry degree, but my amateur understanding is that most of the synthesis chains available here ultimately derive from oil. For example you can get DHF by catalyzing 1,4-butanediol on cobalt or aluminum oxide. Wikipedia lists a number of ways 1,4-Butanediol is made industrially, but they all boil down to oil product, natural gas, or the occasional "we mostly make this from oil, but sometimes ethanol is used instead". The most "bio-sourced" of those is via Butadiene, where wikipedia claims "While not competitive with steam cracking for producing large volumes of butadiene, lower capital costs make production from ethanol a viable option for smaller-capacity plants."It reads like a nice material, but as usual temper your expectations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has there been any research into some layered degradable solutions, where the first layer can handle water but not sunlight and the second layer can handle sunlight but not water and as soon as they, by friction, separates they start degrading by the elements?Not handling sunlight might not be ideal, but it is something instead of seeing our seas and beaches slowly turn into dumps and our bodies into plastic containers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why recycling plastics is desirable.  Plastics are made from hydrocarbons, right?  So putting them in the ground amounts to carbon sequestration, which is good?  What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999598</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of reproducibility in NixOS, discussing the operating system's ability to create consistent environments through its package manager, Nix. It examines the strengths and potential limitations of NixOS regarding system configuration and package management, particularly in scenarios involving dependencies and system updates. The author reflects on real-world experiences and perspectives, ultimately questioning whether NixOS can truly guarantee a fully reproducible system across various contexts and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989666"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Our most important finding is that the reproducibility rate in nixpkgs has increased steadily from 69% in 2017 to about 91% in April 2023. The high reproducibility rate in our most recent revision is quite impressive, given both the size of the package set and the absence of systematic monitoring in nixpkgs. We knew that it was possible to achieve very good reproducibility rate in smaller package sets like Debian, but this shows that achieving very high bitwise reproducibility is possible at scale, something that was believed impossible by practitioners4I think people in this thread are focusing on the wrong thing. Sure, not all packages are reproducible, but the project is systematically increasing the percentage of projects that are reproducible while ALSO adding new projects and demonstrating conclusively that what was considered infeasible is actually readily achievable.&gt; The interesting aspect of these causes is that they show that even if nixpkgs already achieves great reproducibility rates, there still exists some low hanging fruits towards improving reproducibility that could be tackled by the Nix community and the whole FOSS ecosystem.This work is helpful I think for the community to tackle the sources of unreproducible builds to push the percentage up even further. I think it also highlights the need for automation to validate that there aren't systematic regressions or regressions in particularly popular packages (doing individual regressions for all packages is a futile effort unless a lot of people volunteer to be part of a distributed check effort).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this debate comes down to exactly what "reproducible" means. Nix doesn't give bit-exact reproducibility, but it does give reproducible environments, by ensuring that the inputs are always bit-exact. It is closer to being fully reproducible than most other build systems (including Bazel) -- but because it can only reasonably ensure that the inputs are exact, it's still necessary for the build processes themselves to be fully deterministic to get end-to-end bit-exactness.Nix on its own doesn't fully resolve supply chain concerns about binaries, but it can provide answers to a myriad of other problems. I think most people like Nix reproducibility, and it is marketed as such, for the sake of development: life is much easier when you know for sure you have the exact same version of each dependency, in the exact same configuration. A build on one machine may not be bit-exact to a build on another machine, but it will be exactly the same source code all the way down.The quest to get every build process to be deterministic is definitely a bigger problem and it will never be solved for all of Nixpkgs. NixOS does have a reproducibility project[1], and some non-trivial amount of NixOS actually is properly reproducible, but the observation that Nixpkgs is too vast is definitely spot-on, especially because in most cases the real issues lie upstream. (and carrying patches for reproducibility is possible, but it adds even more maintainer burden.)[1]: https://reproducible.nixos.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would note that stagex is 100% reproducible, and full source bootstrapped.Every artifact is reproduced and signed by multiple maintainers on independently controlled hardware and this has been the case since our first release around this time last year.https://codeberg.org/stagex/stagex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989666</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for optimizing Foreign Function Interface (FFI) performance in Ruby on Rails applications, focusing on "tiny JITs" (Just-In-Time compilations). It highlights how small, targeted improvements can significantly speed up the execution of FFI calls, thereby enhancing overall application performance. The author provides insights into specific techniques and best practices for developers to implement, ensuring efficient interaction between Ruby and underlying C libraries. Overall, the piece emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning FFI operations to achieve faster application responses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to deal with a lot of FFI to enable a Java Constraint Solver (Timefold) to call functions defined in CPython. In my experience, most of the performance problems from FFI come from using proxies to communicate between the host and foreign language.A direct FFI call using JNI or the new foreign interface is fast, and has roughly the same speed as calling a Java method directly. Alas, the CPython and Java garbage collectors do not play nice, and require black magic in order to keep them in sync.On the other hand, using proxies (such as in JPype or GraalPy) cause a significant performance overhead, since the parameters and return values need to be converted, and might cause additional FFI calls (in the other direction). The fun thing is if you pass a CPython object to Java, Java has a proxy to the CPython object. And if you pass that proxy back to CPython, a proxy to that proxy is created instead of unwrapping it. The result: JPype proxies are 1402% slower than calling CPython directly using FFI, and GraalPy proxies are 453% slower than calling CPython directly using FFI.What I ultimately end up doing is translating CPython bytecode into Java bytecode, and generating Java data structures corresponding to the CPython classes used. As a result, I got a 100x speedup compared to using proxies. (Side note: if you are thinking about translating/reading CPython bytecode, don't; it is highly unstable, poorly documented, and its VM has several quirks that make it hard to map directly to other bytecodes).For more details, you can see my blog post on the subject: https://timefold.ai/blog/java-vs-python-speed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Between Rails At Scale and byroot's blogs, it's currently a fantastic time to be interested in in-depth discussions around Ruby internals and performance! And with all the recent improvements in Ruby and Rails, it's a great time to be a Rubyist in general!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Rather than calling out to a 3rd party library, could we just JIT the code required to call the external function?I am pretty sure this is the basis of the LuaJIT FFI: https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.htmlI think LuaJIT's FFI is very fast for this reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43030388</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art language models by utilizing a method called "prompt tuning." This technique optimizes a small set of parameters while keeping the underlying model weights fixed. The authors demonstrate that prompt tuning can achieve competitive results compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, with significantly less computational cost and data requirements. They also explore different strategies for selecting prompts and illustrate the effectiveness of their approach across various tasks and benchmarks in natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked a bit into this a few years back and found it quite interesting. Despite them calling them "Tiny Pointers" I would say it's closer to a open addressing hash map. You have a specific key, and then you can "allocate" an entry in the hash map. This gives you back a "pointer". You can then later use the original key and the pointer together to determine the index of the entry. There's also a slight chance that the allocation will fail (similar to a hash collision in a hash map). The "trick" here is that two different keys can end up having the exact same pointer (because we're always dereferencing with the key). This makes them more compact.I was struggling a bit to come up with good use cases for it. Their examples are all around combining them with existing data structures and they show that the space complexity is smaller, but it wasn't completely clear to me how feasible this would actually be in practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Didn't Python's compact dictionary implementation do this a decade ago?"The dict type now uses a “compact” representation based on a proposal by Raymond Hettinger which was first implemented by PyPy. The memory usage of the new dict() is between 20% and 25% smaller compared to Python 3.5." -- https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-com..."Note, the sizeof(index) can be as small as a single
byte for small dicts, two bytes for bigger dicts and
up to sizeof(Py_ssize_t) for huge dict." -- https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-December/1...The "tiny pointers" are in the _make_index method in the proof of concept code. -- https://code.activestate.com/recipes/578375-proof-of-concept...      @staticmethod

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest blocker for me to switch to using jj currently is https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/3949 which is that it doesn't have a `core.fileMode` option equivalent. What this means in practice is that it's unusable from WSL when your repo is on an NTFS filesystem. It gets confused by NTFS's lack of executable permission bit and makes spurious changes/commits.It's a small thing, but while jj adds some convenience, it doesn't add enough (for me) to offset the inconvenience of changing my workflow to not use WSL. (Another relatively minor inconvenience is its inability to use your SSH configs. So if you have multiple key pairs and need to use specific ones that aren't jj's default pick, an ssh-agent is the only way.)That said, I would 100% recommend jj over git for any new programmer who hasn't yet had to contort their brain already into the git ways. All the things that git's UI does a great job of obscuring and presenting in a confusing way, jj presents in a straightforward way that makes sense and is easy to remember.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workflow-wise I was struggling a bit to figure out how to work with the bookmarks in jj not moving along.I now have a bit of a new strategy:- When starting up a branch, right up the "final commit message", along with a bunch of notes on what I think I need and other TODOs- While working, when I want to checkpoint some work, I use jj split to chop up some chunk of work, describe it, and then edit up my TODOsthis way the tip of my branch is always this WIP commit describing my end goal, I can find it, and I can add a bookmark to it.Instead of git "I add changes over time and make my commit graph move forward", it's "I have a final commit node and add commits _behind it_". Been working well enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for this! Just yesterday I decided to finally start really using jj with real work, whereas I had only fiddled around with it a few times while following tutorials over the past year.One suggestion - reverse the direction of the arrows: q-&gt;r rather than q&lt;-r&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43020180</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article from Tom's Hardware discusses a significant trend observed in CPU performance, noting that for the first time in 20 years, PassMark reports a yearly decline in average CPU performance across its benchmark results. This decline reflects the challenges faced by the industry, including supply chain issues and increasing focus on power efficiency rather than sheer performance. The article explores the implications of this trend for consumers and the broader tech market, while also analyzing the potential reasons behind these changes in CPU performance dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t believe these numbers mean what they think. Their sample size has dropped dramatically since the previous year, from 100k to 25k for laptops and from 186k to 48k for desktops. Given that all the data comes from people choosing to run the benchmark, I wonder what population has suddenly left the data, and if that is significant.Also consider that the CPU is only one component of this benchmark. The article itself says that Windows 11 performance is worse than Windows 10. This might be another instance of “What Andy [Grove] giveth, Bill [Gates] taketh away.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could be several things, ranging from mundane to very concerning.- People are downgrading their computers.- Windows 11 is more bloated and slower, decreasing the test scores.- All the security mitigations are making everything slower but they've been masked by hardware improvements in the past. Now there isn't much in terms of that so we start the slow descent to death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's because many new Windows PCs have Snapdragon ARM processors which are slower than x86 processors (but have much better battery life).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43017612</guid></item><item><title>33.

They've had DECADES to polish this experience (in general for any educational content), at least under the premium tier and I've given up all hopes of them ever getting this right.Off the top of my head, such a platform could:    1. Encourage and foster great discussions (and support markdown!)
    2. Have a "community notes" kind of feature to highlight outdated info, errata, related talks etc.
    3. Expose brand new conferences and lesser known ones
    4. Allow people to share curated lists
    5. Likes/dislikes restored
    6. View count tracking from across multiple sources (some confs host on their site before YouTube upload)
    7. Support for interactive viewing of decks, source code etc.
    8. Speaker profiles (w/ verification)
    9. Automation to help conferences/speakers/etc. to submit/update content they own/keep things in sync

We have This and Sapling (mercurial) for alternative git.
Back in 2014 up til 2018 we used mercurial , development workflow is a lot smoother and better in DX wise vs git but soon after bitbucket decided to cut mercurial we have no choice but to use Git since there is literally no opensource or cloud service mercurial `hub` in existence.What you need for your CVS to be popular is not having a new CVS that do a thing a little bit different and better vs Git but to have a good GitHub alternative. In Git world there we have Gitea  - which is very easy to setup and experience is much better than github , and gitlab for bigger orgs. Plus a good IDE support.Sapling and JJ need something like that - built in or selfhostable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021515</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been one of those people with one account for media, purchases and subscriptions and another one for iCloud. The purchases account, referred to as secondary in this document, is shared with family members (i.e., they use this same account and credentials for purchases too). Family members in turn have their own individual iCloud accounts.I’ve never tried doing Family Sharing with this setup because it seemed confusing — it wants to use the iCloud account as the primary one whereas I’ve always added credit to the purchases account (taking advantage of some Apple Store Code discount offers).Now, I have some credit balance on my purchases account, but I do see the “Migrate Purchases” option in settings even though this document says it won’t be available until I:&gt; Spend any balance remaining on your secondary Apple Account.If this is enforced during migration or prevents me from migrating, I’d have to wait for a year or so to use up that balance. Apple really should’ve included account balance transfer as part of the migration.To add to this mess, I actually have two purchases accounts across two different countries (i.e., one purchases account for one country and another one for a different country). I’ve only purchased free items in one of those accounts. This works, with some inconvenience, while I don’t touch my iCloud account at all.I’m really interested in getting this sorted out (using one account per family member and using Family Sharing), but it looks like I may run into more problems.If anyone here did read all the way till here, I’m open to suggestions on simplifying this as well as warnings and gotchas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now it would be great if Apple allowed associating more than one country for my purchases to my apple id, i.e. based on having credit cards issued by banks in different countries. 
Seems that for Apple does not exist the concept of living between to countries (expats, dual citizens, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It worked! I haven't felt this thrilled with an Apple update since my iPad Pro became powerful enough to run a calculator!But really, OMG, finally. I tried the process and it worked. Goodbye, legacy account I've been dragging along with me for the last decade!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43019737</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Sprocket Fox discusses the concept of IDO (Initial DEX Offering), a fundraising method for new cryptocurrency projects on decentralized exchanges. It highlights the benefits of IDOs, such as increased accessibility, reduced entry barriers for investors, and a more democratic approach to fundraising compared to traditional methods. The piece also covers key considerations for projects looking to conduct an IDO, including the importance of community engagement, transparency, and providing a clear roadmap to ensure investor confidence and success.&lt;/p&gt;

For everyone else, seems really unlikely that the people you interact with will have setup a malicious attack for your watch brand.  I don't think wardriving smart watches is a thing.I'd only suggest that if the watch supports putting a credit card on it that you rethink doing that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great writeup, didn’t expect “bad authentication” to actually be zero authentication, that’s absurd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get a little nervous about my Pixel watch. None of those watches have been updated since November and there are likely some juicy CVEs hanging out on them.https://developers.google.com/android/ota-watch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992368</guid></item><item><title>38.

Off by at least 6 orders of magnitude.What's interesting is that these materials can be used as sensors, building small voltages/sending small currents when deformed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expectation: "This will have innumerable applications in medical, energy, and robot applications!"Reality: It will be used for sex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always wondered how "living slimes" made their way into various low level video game sewer systems.Now I can see it...this stuff dumped down the drain, mixed with refuse and the occasional decomposing organic material...who knows what it could produce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42986241</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand.You're authoring in TSX and serving JS to browsers, so there's clearly a build step.  How is your model different from e.g. vite serve?How does it get deployed?  Are the files translated to vanilla JS on request, or are they translated ahead of time and cached (in other words, a build step)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Then the app can be started up for local development:
&gt;
&gt; deno -A --watch src/main.tsSure looks like a build step to me?Anyway I'm fine with one easy Deno build step, but Deno already has a fantastic web framework that supports SSR, so how is this different to Fresh?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry, slightly confused. From JSX docs:&gt; The difference is that the precompile transform analyses your JSX statically and stores precompiled HTML strings if possible. That way a lot of time creating JSX objects can be avoided.So if there are compilation errors, who is stopping me from running without the build?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43029089</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "query compilers" in database systems and identifies the lack of a necessary tier for optimizing query execution plans. It emphasizes the importance of integrating this missing tier to enhance performance, simplify code, and provide better optimization strategies for various query executions. The author outlines the challenges faced by current systems and proposes potential solutions to improve query compilation and execution efficiency. Overall, the piece serves as a call to action for further exploration and development in the area of query compilation architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author striked out the part about CedarDB not being available -- which is true -- but Umbra is available as a docker container[1] for some time now. The "Umbra paper" linked also contains an artifact[2] with a copy of Umbra as well as some instructions on how to control the back-ends used etc. (Cranelift is not available as an option in the docker versions however)I kind of disagree with the assumption that baseline compilers are easy to build (depending on your definition of baseline). A back-end like DirectEmit is not easy to write and even harder to verify. If you have a back-end written for your own IR you will likely have to write tests in that IR and it will probably be quite hard to simply port over codegen (or run-) tests from other compilers. Especially in the context of databases it is not very reassuring if you have a back-end that may explode the second you start to generate code slightly differently. 
We're working on making this a bit more commoditized but in our opinion you will always need to do some work since having another IR (with defined semantics someone could write a code generator for you) for a back-end is very expensive. In Umbra, translating Umbra-IR to LLVM-IR takes more time than compiling to machine code with DirectEmit.Also, if it is easy to write them, I would expect to see more people write them.Copy-and-patch was also tried in the context of MLIR[3] but the exec-time results were not that convincing and I have been told that it is unlikely for register allocation to work sufficiently well to make a difference.[1]: https://hub.docker.com/r/umbradb/umbra[2]: https://zenodo.org/records/10357363[3]: https://home.cit.tum.de/~engelke/pubs/2403-cc.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tradeoff in SingleStore is interesting. By default and unlike eg postgres, parameterized queries are planned ignoring the values of the parameters. This allows caching the compiled query but prevents adapting the query plan - for the example in the post SingleStore would pick one plan for both queries.But you can opt out of this behaviour by wrapping each parameter in NOPARAM (https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/sql-reference/c...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author pans meta-tracing and shows a graph of TruffleRuby having really crazy runtime behavior. However, it looks extremely suspicious - like the kind of thing you'd see if there was a memory leak and the garbage collector was running constantly.Most people seem really excited about the results coming out of Graal and TruffleRuby seems to have some really impressive results in general, so the graph is surprising. It's also missing a bunch of details, so it's hard to speak to its voracity - for example, what are the different versions of the runtimes, what flags were used, on what hardware?As a counter example, there's a different (admittedly old) result where TruffleRuby beats cruby on the same benchmark by 4.38x. https://eregon.me/blog/2022/01/06/benchmarking-cruby-mjit-yj...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42996656</guid></item><item><title>41.

I've hit some of these bugs including the registry issue. Thank you for open sourcing it.I've used a combination of ProxyCommand directive in ssh config + a script it calls w/ the `%h` (host) to unpack what the correct instance-id is (like @galanwe). For the proxycommand, you can embed an `aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key` for pushing a key valid for 60s followed by activating the SSM session.The downside is it adds ~20-30s delay in connection due to the API requests, but if you're making repeated rapid requests to same instance, I recommend looking into ssh's ControlPath, ControlMaster and ControlPersist to keep a longer lived session that's re-used for client re-connections (ref: https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/12/11/using-ssh-multiplexing...)[Edit to add that I've hit the registry bug myself]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was wondering if it's possible to use sshuttle with SSM but didn't realize SSM had its own mixing protocol.An SSM client library is super helpful for embedding the tunneling into the client app. At a previous employer, we'd access jumphosts from AWS Session Manager and GCP Identity Aware Proxy and were looking to embed that connection flow into some cli management utilities to ease use. At the time, we ended up starting the tunneling processes separately inside the code but it would have been much nicer and easier with a library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43007982</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the relationship between efficiency and horizontal scalability in software systems, arguing that they are often at odds with each other. The author explains how horizontally scalable systems tend to prioritize distribution and redundancy, which can lead to inefficiencies, while efficient systems might be more constrained and less scalable. Through various examples and analyses, the piece explores the trade-offs that developers face when designing systems, emphasizing the need for balance based on the specific requirements of the application. Ultimately, it highlights the importance of understanding these concepts to make informed architectural decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

Computers have gotten a lot faster, even if the clock speed is not that much faster. A single modern CPU core turboing at ~5Ghz is going to be significantly faster than a 20 year old cpu overclocked to ~4.5Ghz.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds of a Google Paper from 2023 titled Towards Modern Development of Cloud Applications [0]Good read.I ended up putting together a "practical" example of a modular monolith [1] which meets the spirit of the paper and wrote about it here:  https://chrlschn.dev/blog/2024/01/a-practical-guide-to-modul...The goal is to run everything in-process locally, but as modular, separate processes remotely with each node assuming a "role" or a "slice" of the whole.  Local DX is great while retaining a lot of flexibility on how to deploy and scale.[0] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593856.3595909[1] https://github.com/CharlieDigital/dn8-modular-monolith&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two kinds of efficiency:  (i) computing efficiency,  (ii) developer efficiencyIf you are doing everything on one machine you can keep everything in RAM,  if you have more than one machine you're going to have to serialize all the data that passes between the machines and send it over some communication link which is never going to be as fast as reading it out of RAM.The simple case is that there is not a lot of coordination needed between the machines but the coordination overhead can easily be worse than O(N) where N is the number of machines.Developer efficiency may be more important than computing efficiency in many cases.  Hadoop, like Bitcoin, blindsided the distributed systems community because it was so much worse than MPI [1] but MPI applications were being developed by PhD students and postdocs and with Hadoop you could replace your  grep ... | awk ... | sort ... | uniq | grep ... | awk ...

pipeline with a simple Pig script with no talent at all and have it run pretty fast by most people's standards on a huge dataset...  Even though the MPI geniuses could get it to run 1000x faster.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43028200</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love these old stories.Back in the 80's in Southern California, I remember making weekly trips to the local "Software Bank" shops, wherein thousands of floppy disks full of shareware and other goodies was traded, record-shop style, in a kind of local swap mart.  It had a very solid social aspect - often there were other kids like me, browsing the wares, flipping past endless rows of 5.4" (and later 3.5") floppy disks, looking for interesting and new software to hack around with.I really have a lot of nostalgia for those days - it was a time when computing was young and special and quite adventurous.  Of course, we are still special and adventurous, just not so young.Recently, during a dumpster diving mission, I found myself in the posession of 3,000 brand new/unused pre-formatted 3.5" floppy disks, which I have been slowly distributing among my circles to anyone who needs them.  However, the space they occupy is needed and the pace of distribution is too slow .. so I've been considering making a floppy-based 'zine, just for the fun of it.Trouble is, what to put on the 'zine, how to craft it to make it interesting, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of "intensional joy," which is the joy derived from meaningful experiences and connections rather than mere external achievements. It discusses how intensional joy is tied to one’s intentions and values, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and mindfulness in cultivating happiness. The piece encourages readers to reflect on their own values and pursue activities that align with them, fostering a deeper sense of fulfillment and joy in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of resisting authoritarianism by adopting a proactive stance against potential injustices and oppressive measures before they are implemented. It emphasizes the necessity of collective action and moral responsibility to challenge systems of power that seek to undermine freedoms. The author argues that anticipating and refusing to comply with unjust laws can serve as a powerful form of protest, and highlights historical examples of individuals and groups who have successfully resisted authoritarian regimes through such preemptive actions. Overall, the piece advocates for vigilance and active resistance in the face of growing authoritarian tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I highly recommend Timothy Snyder's Bloodlands, if you have the stomach for it. It's an absolutely brutal book that made me appreciate truly liberal democratic governance, for all its many flaws. Things could get so much worse, and often do, under autocrats, even in our current world. Even if they don't quite match the suffering of Belarus, Poland and Ukraine under the power of autocrats.When I was younger I never had the patience to learn from history.  Now that most of my life is about understanding people rather than understanding code, I can't get enough history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of amazed this was let on the front page of HN. I've seen so many political posts sunk to the abyss the past few weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's the only way to resist. That, and vocally and vociferously insisting on the rule of law. Timely post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021333</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the implementation of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions in computing to enhance performance by processing multiple data points simultaneously. It outlines the benefits of SIMD in various applications, including multimedia processing and scientific computations, and provides insights into the architectural considerations and programming techniques associated with utilizing SIMD effectively. The text emphasizes the importance of leveraging SIMD capabilities in modern processors to achieve significant speedups in data-intensive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

So I scaled down my ambitions a little.Array languages and SIMD are a match made in heaven.  This should be the paradigm of choice for high-performance programming, but it's unfortunately pretty obscure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's about the author's language named Apple[1], took a few seconds since Apple Array System unfortunately sounds like some MacOS framework.For people prefer C-like syntax, there is ispc[2], which supports x86 AVX and ARM Neon programming via LLVM.[1] https://github.com/vmchale/apple[2] https://github.com/ispc/ispc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my blog posts was posted and got some comments. This is a more refined take in the vein of "C is Not Suited to SIMD"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990701</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;BYD, a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced that it will provide advanced self-driving technology comparable to Tesla's in all of its models at no additional cost. This initiative is part of BYD's strategy to enhance its competitive edge in the EV market by making sophisticated driving assistance features accessible to a broader range of customers. The company aims to capitalize on the growing demand for autonomous driving capabilities while positioning itself as a strong rival to established players like Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was in Mexico City two weeks ago and a few uber drivers were driving BYD Dolphins.
 I was impressed. At a $14k price point, I can’t imagine better value for money. I got sucked into research and there are no near term plans for expanding to the US market.
It’s too bad. They’re expecting to sell 500,000 units in Mexico this year. With the current (lower) emissions standards, I’m optimistic such affordable EVs will make a big difference to air quality in the coming years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch Out of Spec for reviews of the latest Chinese EV tech including ADAS and battery swapping...https://outofspecstudios.com/I was floored by what they are producing in China. It is a shame that these cars are not reaching more of the world and raising the competitive bar. I get the government subsidy and lower labor costs issues, but the tariffs are retarding competition, propping up prices, and hurting consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are US EVs 2-3x the cost of BYD EVs? Do US consumers not want cars at that price point, is it regulation, is to labor/material costs, or some combination thereof?It seems like if there was a $15-$20k EV in the US market, it would be a no-brainer "around town" second car.Instead we get $30k Model 3/Y's or $80k EV SUV/Vans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43018989</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to resign from their position as the project lead of the Asahi Linux project. The author reflects on their experiences, accomplishments, and challenges faced within the project, emphasizing the importance of community support and collaboration in open-source development. They express gratitude towards contributors and the community, outline the reasons behind their resignation, and highlight the project's ongoing commitment to Linux on Apple Silicon hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one).This sounds so rough. I can't imagine pouring your heart out into this labor of love and continue to have to face something like this. Back in the early days of Quora, when it used to be good, there used to be a be nice be respectful policy (they might still have it), I wonder if something like that would be helpful for open source community engagement.Regardless, major props to Marcan for doing the great work that he did, our community is lucky to have people like him!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person can be in a tough spot personally and then things seem to spiral out of control around them because that just cannot be 100% isolated from professional stuff or other spheres of life. It seems like this might have happened to Hector based on the post. We've all been there and that part is completely understandable.&gt; I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community.The abrasiveness though is the reason people react that way. Not everyone is going to respond with "hey that was abrasive, that's not how we do things, here is a better way to phrase it". The majority will simply shut down or start forming cliques in the background. I can't completely blame them either. Here is Hector threatening to launch a shaming social media campaign on kernel devs:&gt; https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/208e1fc3-cfc3-4a26-98..."If shaming on social media does not work, then tell me what does, because I'm out of ideas."That's not ok. Even if he feels he is right and they are wrong. People will create cliques and talk behind your back if you act that way. People will look on Rust community after this and say "Remember that time when _they_ where threatening kernel devs with social media drama?". It's not right but that's the perception that will last.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marcan links to an email by Ted Tso'o (https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250208204416.GL1130956@mit.ed...) that is interesting to read. Although it starts on a polarising note ("thin blue line"), it does a good job of explaining the difficulties that Linux maintainers face and why they make the choices they do.It makes sense to be extremely adversarial about accepting code because they're on the hook for maintaining it after that. They have maximum leverage at review time, and 0 leverage after. It also makes sense to relax that attitude for someone in the old boys' network because you know they'll help maintain it in the future. So far so good. A really good look into his perspective.And then he can't help himself. After being so reasonable, he throws shade on Rust. Shade that is just unfortunately, just false?- "an upstream language
community which refuses to make any kind of backwards compatibility
guarantees" -&gt; Rust has a stability guarantee since 1.0 in 2015. Any backwards incompatibilities are explicitly opt-in through the edition system, or fixing a compiler bug.- "which is actively hostile to a second Rust compiler
implementation" - except that isn't true? Here's the maintainer on the gccrs project (a second Rust compiler implementation), posting on the official Rust Blog -&gt; "The amount of help we have received from Rust folks is great, and we think gccrs can be an interesting project for a wide range of users." (https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gccrs-an-alternative-c...)This is par for the course I guess, and what exhausts folks like marcan. I wouldn't want to work with someone like Ted Tso'o, who clearly has a penchant for flame wars and isn't interested in being truthful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43036904</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This app seems to require a server.  Invoke the app, and it presents a login screen, with links to "register" and to "use custom server".I suppose an alternative design would be to be on-device storage first, and then have an optional sync to a server (or laptop/desktop).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a missing "product" for [easy] "self-hosting" in the cloud?  (Or does it exist?  Or will it only apply to a narrow kind of user?)Like I think there should be some way to "one-button-click" install "self-hosted" apps in the cloud, tied to my personal account (and maybe with auth tied to that account).  And I pay the usage fees for the cloud (hopefully on a per-request kind of basis, not an always-on server instance).Is this a thing that I don't know about?  Or is the market too narrow to be useful?  (Otherwise, why doesn't it already exist?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another interesting self-hosted tracker is https://ryot.io/.Demo: https://demo.ryot.io/_s/acl_vUMPnPirkHlTCode: https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot(PS: they opted to go in a direction where it also includes some media-related features -- like tracking movies or books you've seen/read -- but this can be disabled).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43034329</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Kagi's implementation of Privacy Pass, a feature designed to enhance user privacy and security while browsing. By using Privacy Pass, users can bypass captchas without compromising their personal information. The feature enables users to prove they are legitimate without revealing identifiable details, thereby streamlining their experience on websites that require captcha verification. Kagi emphasizes their commitment to user privacy and the benefits of adopting Privacy Pass for a more seamless and secure online experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat! It's rare to see that a service you use actually does something that benefits the user rather that itself. An unexpected, but a really pleasant surprise.I wish this extension would integrate better with the browser by automatically understanding the context. That is, if I'm in a "regular" mode it'll use my session, but if I'm in a "private browsing" mode (`browser.extension.inIncognitoContext`) it'll use Privacy Pass to authenticate me, without me having to explicitly do anything about it.(I don't use Orion, as there's no GNU/Linux version.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So....is this privacy through assumed lack of logging?  Not trying to be a dick, just legit don't understand a part of this.User A asks kagi for tokens.  Kagi says "sure, here's 500 tokens".  If kagi then logs the 500 tokens it just gave to user A, it now will know if any of those tokens is redeemed at a later date, that they're assigned to user A?Of course if Kagi just doesn't retain this data, then yeah all is good because the token itself is only marked as valid, not valid and given to user A on date Y, but....that's it right?  Or am I misunderstanding something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've read the post and saw the references, but can anyone easily explain how it works? Can the server not just store whatever is generated to link it back to the user using it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43040521</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've started switching back to LibreOffice because the situation with MS Office nagging me to save my files to the cloud, or to use "connected" AI experiences, keeps getting worse.(The connected experiences, including Copilot, can be disabled with a dialog hidden deep in Office's Trust Center, but even that's confusingly worded. It's unclear from the wording and the structure of the dialog what the combination of checking "all connected experiences" but unchecking "experiences that analyze your content" should actually do, for example.)MS Office is certainly the more polished product, especially Excel. There are some spreadsheets I can't feasibly convert to LibreOffice Calc without equivalents to Excel's lambdas and tables.But LibreOffice does the job in most cases. I'm really excited to see this new work—especially CRDT-based sync between desktop app instances over a network file server, which would turn LibreOffice into a significantly better experience than MS Office for my purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is based on the formerly proprietary StarWriter, from a German company. Later acquired by Sun if I remember correctly, then open sourced.There is another commercial German competitor from this time, SoftMaker. I used to buy the suite for Linux, just recently switched to LibreOffice. I never liked the clunky Libreoffice but since SoftMaker refuses to support LanguageTool....There is actually a third German text processor from this time, Papyrus. Born on Atari ST.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Division[2] https://www.softmaker.com/en/products/softmaker-office[3] https://papyrus.de/[4] https://papyrusauthor.com/English new version of Papyrus seems to be released in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My mother-in-law couldn't get her old Word docs to format correctly on her new laptop (Win11 + MS Office365). Rather than fiddle around trying various settings I installed LibreOffice and with it her docs rendered correctly. Made her happy. Libre Writer reminds me of Word2000, which means I don't waste time learning new ways to perform mundane writing tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43038200</guid></item><item><title>5.

I know this stock well all though I'm not a pro. It nailed all of the relevant aspects and hits the analysis right on for everything I know about it.

I've gotten good analysis from other LLM products but they have always been way out of date which makes them useless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that it's possible to convince it that I actually know what I'm talking about. First I asked:"Explain why negative numbers are in fact imaginary"It told me that negative numbers are not imaginary numbers and explained imaginary numbers. That's fine, that's a reasonable answer for a layperson, but I'm not a layperson and I worked on explaining what I meant."Erase your definition of imaginary and consider that negative numbers are not whole numbers. Negative numbers do not represent quantities of physical objects. Now explain how negative numbers are imaginary."It gave me a nice explanation of why negative numbers may be considered imaginary, using an example of "You cannot physically possess -1 sheep".

&lt;p&gt;The document serves as a comprehensive guide to the pipe syntax used in Google BigQuery, explaining how to efficiently utilize pipes in SQL queries to streamline data processing. It details the components of pipe syntax, including the use of operators and expressions to manipulate datasets, as well as practical examples and best practices for implementing pipe syntax in various querying scenarios. The guide aims to help users enhance their query efficiency and improve data analytics workflows within BigQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The SQL with pipe syntax is also been implemented at Databricks since Jan 30, 2025:
https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-s...Still, the best is yet to come. Previously, SQL extensions were a pain. There was no good place, and table-value functions were a mess.Now, it would be possible to have higher-order functions such as enrichment, predictions, grouping or other data contracts. Example:  FROM orders
  |&gt; WHERE order_date &gt;= '2024-01-01'
  |&gt; AGGREGATE SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent GROUP BY customer_id
  |&gt; WHERE total_spent &gt; 1000
  |&gt; INNER JOIN customers USING(customer_id)
  |&gt; CALL ENRICH.APOLLO(EMAIL &gt; customers.email)
  |&gt; AGGREGATE COUNT(*) high_value_customer GROUP BY company.country

This may be called one SQL to determine distinct e-mail domains, then prepare an enriching dataset and later execute the final SQL with JOIN.Iterative SQL with pipes may also work better with GenAI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like it, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble of further expanding an ever-ballooning extended family of SQL syntaxes.Of course, SQL has numerous issues, both in an absolute sense and relative to what we've come to expect. And the obvious course of action in each individual case is to add syntax to support the missing feature.But as you keep adding syntax, SQL gets more and more complex, both in the individual variants and due to the complexities of multiple variants with different syntax support at different times.A transpiling approach makes more sense to me. I'd like the sql implementors to focus on source maps and other things to better support plugging in external, alternate syntaxes (is a standardized mechanism too much to ask for?).Then individual projects/people/efforts can choose the SQL syntax variant that works for them, and it can be one that evolves separate from the host db.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PRQL is a similar idea, and it compiles to SQL: https://prql-lang.org/    from invoices
    filter invoice_date &gt;= @1970-01-16
    derive {
      transaction_fees = 0.8,
      income = total - transaction_fees
    }
    filter income &gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42998904</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the famous "Marshmallow Test," an experiment from the 1960s that measured children's ability to delay gratification. It explores the implications of the test for parenting styles, suggesting that nurturing environments that promote self-control can lead to better long-term outcomes for children. The piece also emphasizes the importance of teaching emotional regulation and resilience, while acknowledging that factors like socioeconomic status and family dynamics can influence a child's ability to delay gratification. Ultimately, it serves as a guide for parents to foster skills in their children that contribute to success and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Think about Japan, where kids are often taught to wait quietly for meals or giftsAuthor got the country and items correct but not associated correctly. In Japan, kids pass the marshmallow test with flying colors but fail the same test if it's a gift. In America kids generally pass the gift test (hypothesis is that they're used to waiting for presents on Christmas).source - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-culture-affec...another source - https://www.colorado.edu/today/2022/07/21/new-take-marshmall...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Another thing I’ve noticed is how much modeling matters. My daughter watches everything I do. If I tell her to wait and then lose my patience two seconds later because the internet is slow, what’s the lesson there?"As a father of 3 kids, I can confirm 100% this is true. Once you understand that, your life changes completely. You realize there is somebody in this world, who will model their life after yours. 
What kind of example you give them is up to you.Suddenly, "be the change you want to see in the world" gets a whole new meaning !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My mom has this very interesting theory: A parent needs to be by a child's side for the first 6-7 years of their life and devote all their time to it. Which is what she did with me. My dad stepped up for the challenge and provided for both of us. My mom had one goal: to make sure that I'd stay curious. She taught me how to read at the age of 4, signed me up for piano lessons(I haven't played piano at all nearly 3 decades later but I can still read notes), she made sure I'd be interested in different cultures, which subsequently pushed me to learn a few languages(which is the biggest contributor to the fact that I am doing very well for myself by a huge margin, forget software engineering, speaking English was the one thing that truly opened up the gates for me). Which on a slightly lower level did exactly what the article says. For contrast, I was old enough to witness and evaluate the extreme opposite - my mom's brother and his wife, who had children when a dog would have sufficed their needs. Their children were pushed aside, no one ever spent any time with them, whenever they started crying, someone jumped over to the toy store, get a bag of toys and shove them in their face so they would shut up. To such an extent that their rooms were filled with unopened toys and I'm not talking about 1 or 2 in a box, I'm talking dozens if not hundreds of toys still in their boxes. Last time I saw these children, they were &gt;10 years old and they had no clue how to use a fork and a knife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43033463</guid></item><item><title>8.

For many people this is a lot easier to understand, and even matches how it is typically used, where Q and R are manually tuned until it “looks good” and never changed again. Moreover, there is just one gain to manually tune instead of multiple quantities Q and R.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43029314</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the interesting phenomenon where integer addition can closely approximate floating-point multiplication, particularly in the context of computer science and numerical computing. It discusses how both operations handle values differently, yet under certain conditions, the results of adding integers can align with multiplying floating-point numbers. The piece delves into the mathematical foundations and practical implications of this relationship, informing readers about the potential impact on algorithm efficiency and numerical stability in various computational applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most significant bits of a floating point representation are basically a logarithm of the number. Logarithms have this relation between multiplication and addition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the core trick in the Fast Inverse Square Root[0], as made famous by the Quake III source code.It uses a shift (equivalent to dividing)  and a subtraction in integer-land to estimate x^(-0.5) in float-land.[0]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat. Of course it works for the exponent, but that it's not that far off for the mantissa is unexpected. It helps that the mantissa is normalized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992505</guid></item><item><title>10.

It is my #1 fear (cancer wise).  My best friend died 3 months to the day after being diagnosed.  It is both a blessing and a curse how quickly this kills you.  The day before he found out we went on a long walk.  Within a couple of weeks we'd walk around the block, then just sit in his living room and talk for hours.  The bad times lasted about 1 week and the last 2-3 days he was not really there.I really hope this test becomes a reality and is OTC and not too expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspiring pancreatic cancer survivor here.  This is excellent news.  Part of the reason this is such a deadly form of cancer is that there are often no symptoms until it's far too late.  I know that there is a blood marker - CA19 - can indicate issues with the pancreas.  I don't know if this blood test is related to that or anything, but any advancements on this disease are great and sorely needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43035147</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide to utilizing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process for research involving human subjects. It outlines key information regarding the purpose and significance of IRB approval, necessary ethical considerations, and the steps required to submit a research proposal for review. The site emphasizes the importance of protecting participants' rights and well-being and includes resources such as templates, FAQs, and contact information for further assistance. Overall, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to navigate the IRB process effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an academic researcher, it's most frustrating in that it feels like IRB scrutiny doesn't seem to align with risk.I do accounting research. My human-subjects research involves surveying practitioners about their jobs, interviewing them about their experiences, and conducting very simple experiments online that ask them to make decisions. There is virtually 0 real risk to any participants of my studies. IRB does always give my studies "exempt" status, but it still has to be reviewed. And they will pester me about different things like where will store our data (Onedrive is fine, but dropbox is not for some reason). This process will typically take a couple weeks of back and forth.Yet I have a friend who participated in a Kinesiology dissertation study where they were asked to do extremely strenuous physical activity. He fainted(!) at one point from the activity. And it seemed to them that there were relatively few safeguards from that happening. Now, I'm sure that study did have IRB approval, but it really got me thinking... are we really scrutinizing studies optimally?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The answer is no, you don't need permission, but you do incur a legal and ethical risk whenever you do research, and as such, the more you can do to strengthen the legal and ethical arguments in your defense, the better.IRBs are simply a way to say "I had an independent group of ethical and legal authority review my research and they thought it was ok".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is just as confusing and explosives and energetics research.Explosives are regulated by the ATF, but can also fall under regulations of the DOT and the EPA. And if your doing any pulse power z pinch or electronic detanator experiment or research, then that's also regulated.Keep in mind this also has state regulations and ordinance to worry about and its almost like they are trying to get you to accidentally make some mistake that can technically be a felony. And they can visit and do inspections during your hours of operations.Potato cannons, model rockets, and innovation and experiments in your backyard seem to be impossible these days.Do I think safety is important, sure, but I'd argue that the paperwork of regulation has stifled the common man who want to follow the laws.Also see: export control and gpu's&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43038395</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome. I’ve also built a number of services for myself (Pinterest style photo hosting for archival/research purposes, analytics service for my websites, tracker for the books I’ve read, message board for micro communities I’m a part of, etc). I also share them with friends who express interest in them.The costs are minimal (they all run on a shared $4/mo instance + $10/yr domain per project) and I get to control where the data lives, the features I want to have, etc.No need to worry about getting the rug pulled on me because the company got acquired or needs to raise revenue or anything like that. No frustration because a redesign made the UI worse or removed features I cared about.It obviously takes a bit of time upfront, but I see it as a long term investment in my productivity. I use boring, basic, stable technologies so once something is deployed it keeps on humming with extremely minimal involvement on my behalf.I’m basically slowly working on replacing pretty much every 3rd party app I use with something I wrote myself (it’s going to take a while but that’s okay). My grandpa was a carpenter and pretty much every piece of furniture in the house was something he or his friends had made. As software craftspeople, we should strive to do the same with our digital houses.Kudos to the author and anyone else who does this. You don’t hear about these things in the mainstream because there’s no reason for people doing this to shout it from the rooftops, but this is software at its best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Christian's been an awesome Glitch community member for a long time; I had caught Thinkserver when he first posted about it the other day. Generally, over the last 7 or 8 years we've seen super users be inspired to make their own tools like this every few months and it's great! Every single one has good ideas and brings new things to the table, and also there's a lot to learn from the overall trends. (Like, in this case, support for coding on phones, where we're still not very strong.)The other takeaway I got from his original blog post is a little bit of that trepidation you get when you put this stuff out there, where it can be a little nerve-wracking, because you don't want folks to rip it apart or file a million bug reports. fwiw I'm glad folks are being mostly chill about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've recently discovered the joys of vscode-server[0] for this type of use case.Which you can either serve as a WebApp direct from your machine, or tunnel in from another VSCode instance - including a webhosted version from Microsoft[1]I may not do that much coding these days, but I already have found it handy for when I forgot to do a Git push! Just log back in to the Web Environment and everything is how I left it.[0] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a kid in the 80s and early 90s I was fascinated with the process of making video games for my favorite console. But back then I didn’t really know how to research that topic (and much of it - unbeknownst to me - was behind NDA anyway).One day I asked my friend if he knew how these games were programmed. He confidently claimed that they were made in a top secret tool called NPL - The Nintendo Programming Language.Of course that kid didn’t know anything more about it than I did so this was just a wild rumor. Now I know that “NPL” was just 6502 assembly with the correct system documentation and some dev hardware, but kid me didn’t know that. Instead, he spent a lot of time dreaming up what this super secret language looked like.When I checked out NESFab today I instantly saw something that looked very much like what 7 - 9 year old me would have imagined. So thanks for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, this is my project. Cool to see it here again.You might like this article I wrote on the backend:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been working through the accounts of a deceased family member over the past few years. They left a password file that made its way to me so I’m able to log in to most things “as them.” My goal is to harvest anything the family might want as a memory: messages, photos, etc., and to clean up (close) all their accounts to prevent identity theft.A few notes of interesting things I’ve found:Observing inbound mail for over a year is by far the best way to learn where a person has accounts. I found a ton of services that weren’t listed in the password file by seeing “year end summary” or “we’ve updated our terms” emails. And then of course email access is useful to reset the password and get in.No one sends more fucking email than politicians. It’s honestly insane how many emails came in daily to this account from all sorts of a candidates, from all over the country. The email list sharing is blatant and rampant. And without regular pruning (unsubscribing, marking as spam), the volume just grows and grows.Some companies have very handy “close and delete this account” features. Some let you end a paid subscription, but there’s no way to remove the account. In one case I killed a subscription to a paper and then was able to log in as the deceased 4 years later! But many services do prune: in many cases, trying to log in years later failed.When there was not a “delete account” feature, I filed a support request to delete, explaining that the account holder had passed away. When that did not work I filed a legal request to delete personal data, citing the data privacy law of the state in which the deceased resided. That worked well.I ended up paying to keep the deceased’s phone number active for a while because I kept finding accounts that were set to send SMS codes to permit login. The deceased was good about security, which ended up costing me, ha. Notably, the mobile provider never cut off the number or seemed to notice that a dead person’s phone was still active. As long as the bill gets paid, they don’t look too closely I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A side note about closing accounts.I keep a list of services I closed or asked for my account to be removed and forgot. Today you even often have to make an account to take a look at a tech demo, because the author tries to avoid abuse of their AI service key they used for such demo.After about two years many of these services start sending me messages again. Sometimes it turns out that the account is active again.Recently a recruiter send me an email with a standard cold call: "I have a position that will be a perfect fit for you". I asked where she got my contact and how's that position be a perfect fit, trying to get a feel what she actually knows about me. She said she got the my profile from LinkedIn. When I asked her to post me a link to my profile it turned out the profile was closed. Somehow LI kept the profile and shared my details when she used some recruiter features. ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was in the "archive/hoard everything" camp for several years and lately I've taken a very nihilistic approach at life.I die tomorrow, I don’t think you really MUST save my stuff, especially anything digital.

It takes a lot of effort and money to make a mediocre automobile, it takes a lot more to make a high quality automobile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; critical to the company's EV strategyTIL that Nissan has an EV strategy, other than "build the world's first mass-market EV (Leaf), then ignore it for a decade".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO a Honda Nissan merger would have been terrible for Honda.Nissan is clearly an anchor, and acquiring it would have just dragged Honda down .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43026934</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this landing page has so many buzzwords I don't quite understand what the application/project itself is, but I do understand it's universal, runs everywhere and can run anything anywhere.Could someone who knows what it is, give a simpler description? Is it a OS/kernel? Runtime? Orchestrator? Self-hosted platform? Cloud platform?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question for everyone - I've long wondered if it would be possible to use WASM to create a p2p "cloud" to reduce reliance on datacenters?My thought would be to encrypt all data packets prior to shuffling them into the network, and have some sort of incentive for people to keep their devices running on the network to enhance reliability - probably with a blockchain of sorts that serves as the main "map" of content in the network.The dream goal would be to create a digital "data cooperative" that enables opt-in selling of your data/usage habits, with a default setting of total privacy. Ideally this would be backed by the blockchain to close the loop on the incentive for usage.Is there already something like this that I'm not aware of? Are there any areas of research I should look into?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much marketing fluff on the website. How about showing simple example as how is it easier or useful to deploy some service to fly.io , AWS or GCP or maybe a Postgres deployment to Digital Ocean, Render or whatever. I want to use it but before I want to know how can I move my dependency from managed XYZ and easily run/manage my own deployment of databas, services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43022892</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The team found that all of the volcanoes, including dormant ones, have persistent and large magma bodies.I always thought dormant merely means asleep - as in not currently active, but may wake up at any time. This is different from extinct volcanoes, which would actually be expected not to erupt. Crater lake in particular has well established hydrothermal activity, which strongly suggests there is still something going on below and it may erupt again in the future. Any geologists can explain what the surprising thing here is besides the apparent difficulty to distinguish dormant and extinct?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article follows the typical pop-sci presentation of "scientists are gobsmacked by thing that's obvious to laymen," but of course it's really not like that. This is the abstract of the paper:Quantitative estimates of magma storage are fundamental to evaluating volcanic dynamics and hazards. Yet our understanding of subvolcanic magmatic plumbing systems and their variability remains limited. There is ongoing debate regarding the ephemerality of shallow magma storage and its volume relative to eruptive output, and so whether an upper-crustal magma body could be a sign of imminent eruption. Here we present seismic imaging of subvolcanic magmatic systems along the Cascade Range arc from systematically modelling the three-dimensional scattered wavefield of teleseismic body waves. This reveals compelling evidence of low-seismic-velocity bodies indicative of partial melt between 5 and 15 km depth beneath most Cascade Range volcanoes. The magma reservoirs beneath these volcanoes vary in depth, size and complexity, but upper-crustal magma bodies are widespread, irrespective of the eruptive flux or time since the last eruption of the associated volcano. This indicates that large volumes of melts can persist at shallow depth throughout eruption cycles beneath large volcanoes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientists keep talking about the three sisters rising, so clearly there is action happening there. And St Helens keeps erupting, says clearly there is action happening there. It doesn’t seem surprising that the other volcanoes in the area could also be potentially active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42995762</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the cognitive processes involved in how individuals engage with and respond to persuasive messages. It explores the interplay between emotional appeals and logical reasoning in influencing attitudes and behaviors. The authors present research findings that highlight the effectiveness of different persuasive strategies, emphasizing the role of context and individual differences in shaping responses. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of communication strategies and their impact on decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;size of error reduced by 42.7% (from 2.62 to 1.50 semitones) for the trained timbre, which generalized partially to an untrained timbre. Overall, results provide more convincing evidence for the learnability of AP judgment in adulthood beyond the critical period, similar to most perceptual and cognitive abilities.&gt;they learned to name an average of 7.08 pitchesIts worth noting that this does not fall under a standard definition of absolute pitch. Being a semitone out with 7 tones of recognition isn't even closeIts always been true that adults can learn pseudo absolute pitch - ie improved pitch classification compared to an untrained adult. What's up for debate is if you can learn true absolute pitch, which has an error of 0 semitones, and you can name all 12 pitches with a 0% error rateThe slightly amusing thing is that the evidence they have is precisely the opposite of the conclusion - you cannot learn absolute pitch as an adult&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve learnt absolute pitch for a single note - F3I was learning to sing for the first time at age 20. Learning Michael Buble’s cover of the jazz standard Fever with my singing teacher at the time MohiniIt took about an hour of reinforcing the first 5-10 seconds of the start of the song on loopThat was almost 10 years ago - still nail that specific pitch every timeFrom there I can usually sing that scale correctly without reference, but it’s all anchored on the initial interval of F3 down to D#3Accurate relative ear is more important anyway, I don’t sing anymore but if I was learning I’d focus on intervals and scales/modes over anything else———Another helpful interval is just nailing the octave jump, an example is Chet Baker’s You Don’t Know What Love Is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The perception of perfect pitch as this magical, unattainable thing always seemed odd to me. Not surprised this reinforces that it's mostly about memorization and practice.Think of a song you know best, one you've listened to hundreds of times: can you sing it or hear it in your head pretty accurately (edit - not accurate intervals, but accurate pitch)? If so, congrats, you have the capacity for perfect pitch. Learn what note it starts on and you're 1/12 of the way there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43033971</guid></item><item><title>19.

Somewhat surprising.It doesn’t even seem to occur to people that one might pursue a doctoral degree because one is interested in the subject and wants to do research. It’s always talked about as if getting a PhD is just another rung in a long ladder towards… earning a lot of money? Not only that — it’s apparently such an obvious fact that it’s an unacknowledged (though implicitly present) assumption in almost every comment here.The obsession with the ‘STEM’ acronym (well, really the grouping rather than the name) also winds me up, but I better not go there…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good. Academia is done growing. We're in a steady state, which means if you're in grad school, look at your advisor. Look at the other grad students who have him. Look at the work of the grad students who came before you, with this advisor.  Think about the ones that will come after.Only ONE of you will take your advisor's place, statistically speaking.If you an afford to pursue a PHD for the sake of doing the work and getting the education, go for it. If you have to make the PhD pencil out financially, think long and hard before enrolling. And if your ambition is to be a full professor, reread the first paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43036428</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications and potential benefits of the NVIDIA security team’s exploration into the idea of ceasing the use of the C programming language in favor of safer, more modern alternatives. It highlights the inherent vulnerabilities and risks associated with C, such as buffer overflows, and argues for a paradigm shift towards languages that prioritize safety and security, like Ada and Rust. The piece considers how adopting such languages could lead to fewer security issues and enhance overall software reliability, while also reflecting on the challenges and resistance that may accompany this transition within the software development community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42998383"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They used SPARK instead:  SPARK is a formally defined computer programming language based on the Ada programming language,
  intended for the development of high integrity software used in systems where predictable and
  highly reliable operation is essential. It facilitates the development of applications that demand
  safety, security, or business integrity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_(programming_language)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article doesn't say what parts of Nvidia's stack use SPARK. Considering Nvidia is a huge software company with ~30,000 employees, "There are now over fifty developers trained and numerous components implemented in SPARK" doesn't inspire confidence.IMO the realistic path towards formal verification is AI proof assistants that automate the tedious parts instead of forcing you to write your code in a weird way that's easier to prove&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After briefly skimming through their talk they mention they're a third party consultancy company making recommendations on safety for NVIDIA, so "Nvidia Security Team" take it how you will. Also I think these drastic changes moving towards a completely different language always bug me, especially when the syntax is also completely different.Then there's like everything libraries wise and CUDA is all C/C++ if I'm not mistaken. In every large project I'm sure you're eventually going to find some exploit attack vector.
Especially if the focus from what I believe for GPU/CUDA until recently wasn't mostly focused on security rather than performance and those are always trade-offs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42998383</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article details a presentation at FOSDEM 2025 about "Maptcha," an open-source CAPTCHA solution designed to enhance the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. It discusses how Maptcha aims to protect OSM from automated bots while ensuring that user contributions remain genuine and trustworthy. The speaker will cover the technical aspects of Maptcha, its implementation, and the impact it has on the quality and integrity of data within OpenStreetMap, emphasizing the importance of engaging the community in the development and use of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comments in case the demo developer sees this:* The swiping in the demo was a rough for me, on a laptop with Firefox.  One of the tricks was to be sure to release the mouse button before the pointer hits the edge of white rectangle fake screen.  Swiping off the edge without a button-up event doesn't seem to be handled.* At the end of a swipe that registers, after you mouse-up, there's a noticeable lag of sometimes up to approx. one second, during which the card is frozen in place, before it finishes sliding off.* The rotation effect on the card as it's being swiped wasn't intuitive, IMHO.  It doesn't follow the vertical movement in the swipe, and there's no obvious physical metaphor for why it's doing that.  Perhaps especially with the other roughness going on, the rotation confuses things a little bit more; but maybe, if the other behavior was perfect, the rotation would be fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun and potentially useful project, love it! When I tried it though, it was quite often hard to see whether the bounding box is "really" correct, as it hides what's underneath. Maybe some slight opaqueness could help.Also, my first image had no bounding box at all. Being met by "Swipe right if the red shape is correctly outlining a building. If not swipe left", it felt like the wording or the UX could be improved by filtering for images that are guaranteed to have such a box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;playing with the demo at https://maptcha.crown-shy.com/ , I had problems recognizing the outlines, as they often were colored similar to their structure (low contrast). Some examples I couldn't find any outline at all.Also, seeing a rectangular outlined thing from above, it's often impossible to tell if it qualifies as a building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43040382</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like it! Very fun!
Few ideas: 
- The "submit" box isn't clear on whether it needs the name or the suspect id for the first case 
- It would be nice to have a "copy to notes" button in the output
- It would be nice to have some docs on what functions are available / which dialect this is.I think this very valuable, it's so much more easy to learn if you actually have a small project to work on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A great addition to a field where there aren't many offerings: SQL Island (https://sql-island.informatik.uni-kl.de) and SQL Murder Mystery (https://mystery.knightlab.com) come to mind. The mechanism of SQL Noir is close to that of the latter, i.e., an undirected, essentially standalone adventure.
I myself am working on SQLab, a SQL game engine that allows you to augment an arbitrary base with exercises on that base to produce directed, standalone adventures: https://github.com/laowantong/sqlab.
You download a dump of the database (currently MySQL, SQLite, Postgres), and can play under any administrator interface. On the same page there's a link to the long police investigation I designed for my (French) students. If you're a teacher or researcher in the field, the principles of SQLab are explained here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16120.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh this is perfect. I was just looking for exercises to practice my SQL, and detective games are my jam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43041827</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is an unquestionable overreach on the UK's part. If you live in any country that isn't the UK, you should feel the threat from this: the UK government believes that it is entitled to a backdoor on your hardware, even if you've never stepped a foot on UK soil or intend to. Mass surveillance is a threat to everyone, but this is not an instance of that, which has guards against it, like encryption. This is the UK asking for an encryption backdoor to everything, including for phones that never traverse its soil or internet boundaries, or even cross anywhere near FVEY collection devices.This is a dramatic overreach of authority.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep saying this, and nobody believes me, but I'm just going to keep trying:These things happen because so often we focus the privacy conversation on corporations, which is exactly where the governments want it to be.My controversial but strong opinion is that privacy from corporations matters very little, but privacy from governments matters very much.We need to stop allowing the conversation to get distracted by talking about cookies and ad-tracking and whatnot, and always bring it right back to privacy from governments.Yes, corporations and the government are often in cahoots here - but even then we should be talking about how wrong it is for governments to be buying/taking/demanding data from corporations - keeping the focus squarely on the government.The worst thing a corporation is likely to do (other than giving your data to governments) is to sell you something. That's all they want. They collect data so they can make money off you. That's not so scary to me. Governments want to put you in jail (or freeze your bank account, etc) if you get out of line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to be cynical, but if anyone has looked at anything revealed about security agencies in the last few years it's very clear what's happening here - whenever US wants to do something unpopular/straight up illegal, it just asks the UK(or any other partner country) to do it instead. American government can't ask Apple for data on any American citizen, but if UK obtains that data and then it happens to be shared between agencies......that's all fine. It's been happening already for years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43036434</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of telephone lines for residential networking, highlighting how older infrastructure can still be utilized to create effective home networks. It explores various technologies and methods, such as Powerline Ethernet adapters and DSL, that allow internet connectivity through existing phone lines. The piece emphasizes the benefits of this approach, including cost-effectiveness and the ability to extend network coverage in areas lacking modern wiring, while also addressing potential limitations and performance considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's tangential to the topic (though mentioned in the article towards the end) so I'll be lazy and ask the crowd here: What's the current state of the art in powerline networking?I have an application to network a couple of outbuildings. I don't have tremendous bandwidth needs (1Gbps would be glorious, 100Mbps would be fine). I would prefer wired connections for reliability and privacy. I would prefer not to trench and run fiber. The outbuildings already have electrical service from a central panel. Powerline networking might be a good fit.There's a lot of consumer stuff out there. I'd like something a little more geared toward an industrial, commercial, or service provider use. (Analogously, think of the difference between using a dumb Netgear switch versus a managed name-brand managed switch.)Edit: I appreciate the feedback I'm hearing here. This is exactly the kind of stuff I wanted to hear. Sorry to hijack HN for my personal needs like this!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a shame that a lot of telecoms have either ripped out a bunch of the copper wire they had installed themselves or have just not replaced stolen copper after they successfully lobbied the FTC to let them abandon the lines. It'd have been a great way for communities or small groups to set up their own tiny networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EV charging also uses HomePlug. When Ethernet needed to be added to an existing signal line on the EV connector, HomePlug was chosen as the way to do it. Every EV consequentially will need a HomePlug modem to communicate to a charger, so, the world will have HomePlug around for quite some time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42995418</guid></item><item><title>25.

The video runs you through it, even if it doesn't make it any clearer for non-apl'ers.[0] https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not an implementation, but Bill Gosper's hashlife algorithm blew my mind when I first encountered it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HashlifeMy personal favorite has to be the one I made in x86 assembly ~30 years ago. I didn't know about hash life at the time, but still, it ran pretty fast. I seem to remember I used page flipping and moved the start of video memory each iteration. Or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023875</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents Napkin, a tool designed for developers to visualize and analyze the design process of machine learning models. It introduces an interactive interface that allows users to create and manipulate design artifacts, facilitating better understanding and communication among teams. The text outlines the key features of Napkin, including its ability to support various model architectures and enhance collaboration by allowing real-time editing and feedback. It emphasizes how Napkin aims to improve the overall workflow in machine learning projects and reduce the complexity associated with model design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This document reminds me of the kinds of things I wrote at a smaller scale when I'd self-teach math. The usual pattern was:Step 1. I don't know how X works.Step 2. I collect several sources about X and try to understand it.Step 3. I put in a lot of effort to understand X by reading all these sources repeatedly. I try to do exercises, do calculations, etc. I'm desperately seeking the moment it "clicks".Step 4. I finally kinda sorta "get" X.Step 5. I feel, "why didn't anybody simply explain X in this way?" / "why was everybody so overly formal?" / "why was everybody so overly informal?"Step 6. I'm motivated to write a short note about X that makes it (allegedly) easier to understand X.Step 7. I write it, and I realize it's actually hard to weave together a narrative that doesn't over- or under-assume prerequisites, that captures nuance, that has good examples, etc.Step 8. "There are 15 competing standards."Step 9. Find the next topic X and go back to Step 1.The Infinitely Large Napkin is a really cool consolidation of a ton of undergrad/early grad pure math topics. It's so incredibly expansive in its scope and, if it were in book form, I'd have been ecstatic to have it as a 16 year old.But paging through it, I find that they're very much in the style of quasi-formal lecture notes. A lot of topics are mentioned by their formal definition, and it's followed by a very anemic (if any) discussion, sometimes preceded by a very informal (sometimes humorous) introduction. Often such definitions are immediately followed up by a relatively technical exercise that presumes a fully synthesized understanding of material preceding. This can make it very difficult to learn from as a primary/sole source. It does make it fun to flip through, though, when you already have familiarity with the topics.In my view, this isn't the kind of book you work through. It's not "math distilled". Instead, it can serve as a great diving-off point for a new subject, or an inspiration to know where to look further on a given subject, or even a useful document to find a topic that piques your interest. Other books like this are those of yore that were encyclopedic in nature, such as:- VNR Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics (1975–1989) edited by Gellert et al. The math here doesn't get terribly advanced (complex and numerical analysis), but it's a good, expansive treatment to dive into.- Mathematics From the Birth of Numbers (1997) by Jan Gullberg: This is another grand tour of math, albeit "only" to differential equations. It's refreshingly written by somebody who was a surgeon/anesthesiologist and amateur mathematician.- The Princeton Companion to Mathematics (2008) edited by Timothy Gowers. This is a massive book that covers just about everything, up to and including some of the latest problems in mathematics. It's 1000 dense pages. (There's also the Princeton Companion to Applied Mathematics edited by Nicholas Higham.)- The CRC Encyclopedia of Mathematics (1999) by Eric Weisstein. This is an anti-digitization of the Wolfram MathWorld into book form. Expansive, and also famous for some of the drama around its copyright. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many of you upvote this pretenting to find some day the time and spirit to read and learn from it, but perfectly knowing that will never happen. I'm one of them unfortunally, gosh!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technically, napkin is a diminutive of "nape" with the suffix "kin" meaning small[0]. So really the title probably ought to be "An Infinitely Large Nape". Unless the author is going for an oxymoronic use of napkin like "jumbo shrimp".[0] https://www.etymonline.com/word/napkin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999258</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misconception that modern cryptography relies solely on NP-hard problems. It explains that while certain cryptographic algorithms may use hard problems as a basis for security, many cryptographic systems are instead built on foundational mathematical principles and computational complexity that do not strictly classify as NP-hard. The author emphasizes the diversity of cryptographic techniques and the ongoing advancements in the field that extend beyond NP-complexity, highlighting that some cryptographic schemes may even be secure against quantum attacks without relying on NP-hard problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is one cryptosystem that uses an NP-hard problem for its security: the McEliece cryptosystem. The problem used here is decoding a generalized version of an error correcting code, which can be made both NP-hard in theory and in practice if you use the right kind of code. It is reliant on using very specific algorithmic parameters to stay hard, though. However, the versions that are not broken are likely post-quantum ready.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is a bit confusing (to me as a layman), basically as I understand it's saying that the reason we can't form cryptosystems out of arbitrary NP-complete problems is because there exist randomized algorithms that work for 99% of inputs (average vs. worst-case complexity, e.g. why the simplex algorithm works in practice). But there are some things missing:* We know that randomized algorithms exist for NP-complete problems. But couldn't we have some problem in NP that while reducible to e.g. 3SAT always reduce to "very hard" instances?* Conversely, there's no guarantee that there doesn't exist a randomized algorithm for something that's NP-hard (and not in NP), right?The argument along the lines of NP-complete vs NP-hard seems to be a non-sequitur, since the actual distinction is average vs. worst-case hardness right? It may just so happen that all currently known problems in NP are easy "on average", but I don't think that's formally guaranteed.Edit: https://theory.stanford.edu/~trevisan/average/slides.pdf seems to imply that (1) is an open question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author should’ve stayed in the NP class and not drop out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43031372</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be great if we could also go ahead and fix subpixel anti-aliasing for OLED screens. People have been been trying for years to get Microsoft's attention about this issue. [1]The subpixel layout of OLED screens is different than the the traditional layout, so text ends up looking pretty bad. Patching ClearType would be the first step to fixing this issue. I'm surprised that none of the display manufacturers have tried twisting Microsoft's arm to fix this issue. At the present moment OLED screens are the superior display technology, but cannot be used for productivity because of this issue.[1]: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My overriding feeling after reading this is: displaying text is a key job of a web browser. A browser that showed no text would be useless. And yet, after learning that Chromium's text looked wrong on Windows (by far the most important platform for Edge and Chrome), it took 4 years for the Chromium and/or Edge teams to fix it.4 years of user research?3 years to respect the user's ClearType Tuner values?Being a regression from pre-Chromium Edge, this should have been a release blocker on Chromium-based Edge. Instead, text looked bad for 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrome's font rendering issue on Windows has been known for more than a decade. Turns out all you need to do is reading proper gamma/contrast values from register.But they didn't fix it in Skia, so most Skia based projects still have shitty font rendering on Windows.Here is the meta issue tracker:https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40037626&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43036593</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read down pretty far and did not see this basic advice: you need a lawyer. Hire a very good one: they are cheaper than poor lawyers by an order of magnitude.That lawyer will review your agreements, the state laws and the communications with the company and tell you where you’re at. You could all go in together for the lawyer btw if you have the same contract.I bet that lawyer will tell you (if this is in California) that you just need to send a letter saying “cool guys, send the shares, I’ll worry about the taxes. I don’t consent to forfeiture.” But, crucially, I am not a lawyer and I haven’t read your agreements.anyway I would not stress over this, but I would act quickly, don’t sign anything, don’t communicate with the company unt you’ve talked to the lawyer, and know that worst case you will be able to find a loan to bridge this. It may actually be a good candidate for a venture debt firm, but either way the lawyer you hire will probably have some leads.Congrats on the IPO!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is sad and surprising.I’ve been through so many shenanigans during my previous life as a naive startup employee: paid huge amounts of AMT (which took years to recoup via AMT credits), was not offered 83b election, had to write huge checks to exercise ISO, had to pay taxes when exercising NSO, etc., but I had never heard of a company threatening to forfeit the RSU if tax is not wired to them, it’s simply wild, especially when the liquidity is so close.If I was in your shoes and the amount was substantial, I’d consult a lawyer. I hired one to help me facilitate a secondary sale transaction contract and it cost me $4k, money well spent. Tons of them in the Bay Area.I would truly love to know how this will end up for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We are curious if this type of distinction between current and former employees is typical for post-IPO RSU settlements.I'm watching this thread, but just as a reminder that it benefits the company to be as vague and complicated as possible for ex-employees trying to exercise their equity rights. You and your equity are effectively dead weight to the company now and it's in their best interest to get you to forfeit as much as possible. The best time to cash in your equity is always when you are still an employee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43026774</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of the Modified, Exclusive, Shared, and Invalid (MESI) cache coherence protocol, which is essential for maintaining data consistency in multi-core processors. It explains the four states of a cache line, detailing how each state affects the behavior of caches in a multiprocessor system. The site also discusses the importance of the MESI protocol in minimizing latency and ensuring efficient data sharing among processors by preventing stale data access. Overall, the content serves as an educational resource for understanding the MESI protocol's role in computer architecture and cache management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obviously cache snooping is going to be device-dependent, but the way this shows things happening is that if you write an address that exists in another CPU's cache, that the invalidation doesn't happen until that CPU later tries to read the address.  That requires two snoop cycles be dedicated, which is a waste.  The secondary CPU is already listening to the snoop bus, it can/should (and in practice does on basically all devices, AFAIK) be able to recognize that write fly by and free up its cache line preemptively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42995656</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;JesseSort is a lightweight, efficient sorting algorithm designed by user lewj85, implemented in JavaScript. The repository provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm's mechanics, including its performance characteristics and use cases. Users can access the source code, examples for implementation, and test cases to understand its functionality better. Additionally, the project encourages collaboration and contributions from the community, inviting developers to enhance the algorithm or adapt it for their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the idea is that you'll eventually arrange n elements into ideally about √n sorted lists, organized so that the endpoints of these lists are also ordered (the "rainbow" shape). A new element goes on the end of one of those lists or a new list; which one is generally decided by binary search, but the index is saved to speed up the next insertion if it's the same. So a natural run might benefit by having adjacenct values inserted to the same list.Which cases benefit and which don't seems potentially quite erratic. If you have a series of runs that shrink over the course of the array, with increasing start value and decreasing start value, each will become a new sorted list and you end up with O(n) insertion plus a perfect merge. If the runs get wider instead, they'll cross over existing endpoints and end up spattered around before merging.It feels like the paper keeps trying to spin constant-factor improvements as somehow being asymptotically relevant despite acknowledging that mathematically they aren't, for example the fact that log(√n) is only log(n)/2 "would not reflect the sublinear nature of base array length k" and runs hitting the best case "approximately 50% of the time... reinforces JesseSort's average runtime complexity as somewhere between O(n) and O(n log_2 n)". Powersort provably takes O(n + n log r) worst-case time where r is the number of runs; I expect this algorithm is O(n log n) worst- and average-case.However, on random arrays the given benchmarks do improve relative to Python default as the length increases, with faster performance starting a little under a million elements. There isn't a lot of investigation into why this is. I'd be interested to know if the number of comparisons is reduced in particular. Perhaps this algorithm is more cache-friendly with a random input, but this wouldn't be reliable as many inputs can cause the number of sorted lists to scale with O(n) so that the binary searches need to work on a large array.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're going to make a big claim about sort speed, tell me how speed is better/worse for various data. How do the algorithms compare when the data is already ordered, when it's almost (but not quite) already ordered, when it's largely ordered, when it's completely random, and it's in the opposite order. This stuff, as well as the size of the dataset, is what we need to know in practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And what about pdqsort, glidesort, driftsort, ipnsort? New research is always cool, but there's plenty of other research in this space to compare this to&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43040869</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;An industrial designer has developed a versatile drill bit that functions not only as a drill but also as a driver for screws, streamlining the process of hole-making and fastening in various projects. This innovative tool aims to enhance efficiency and convenience for users by eliminating the need for multiple tools.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, a coffee-maker/fax-machine. I’ve used, collected, lost, sharpened, broken more drill bits and drivers than I can count. I’ve never wished for a worse drill bit attached to a worse screw driver.I bet they’ll sell a lot of these to homeowners with deck projects, or small softwood projects, and I bet they’ll work just fine for that.The use case limits how hard they can make these.  Absolutely the philips head will get munged being used as a drill bit, and then it’ll cam out of screws at the wrong time. If your driver bit is much harder than your screws then the screws will get stripped. A stripped screw in something important is worse than a broken driver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50% savings seems very optimistic. If you drill all your holes, switch once, then drive all your screws, there's only a few seconds this thing can possibly save you. Then you consider that it takes a smidge more effort to drill with this sub-optimal bit, and it's really a stretch. There would have to be some aspect of the project's assembly sequence that required you to switch multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given how easy it is to blow out a Phillips head with a drill and a bit that's not perfect, and given how much difference a good 135 degree jobber bit from a reputable manufacturer like Norseman makes, I can't see this being very good at either in a real world scenario.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991776</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't really say enough good things about Vim. I retired early as a staff software engineer because of the work I did using Vim. From hacking silly games in C in high school to now, I've always been able to use Vim and run circles around any "modern" text editor or IDE. I feel like I owe Vim as much public praise as I can give so others can reap the rewards like I did.What really frustrates me is how little people seem to want to invest in their tools, or the outright lies they tell themselves about how much configuration they need to use Vim on a daily basis. My Vim config is 200 lines, and my last commit was 3 years ago. I've invested maybe a few days of my life into configuring Vim and I use it 8-16 hours a day.Vim can do so much on its own. It has autocomplete, fuzzy finding, integration with build systems, file search, navigation using a directory browser, jump to symbol, parse compiler output to jump to bugs, support for gdb and breakpoints, a built in terminal, copy to and from the system clipboard, and with literally 8 lines of code you can get support for every linter, LSP, etc. known to man, fuzzy finding, and git integration that let's you use native git commands with seamless editor integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; sorting and reversing over motionVim can run shell commands as filters over selections as well.Although vim does provide its own `:sort`, you can also sort the current selection like  v{motion}!sort

Which uses the external sort command (coreutils)For reversing,  v{motion}!tac

Which uses `tac` to reverse the order of the lines.This general concept is quite useful in many other ways, since it is quite universal - selection goes to stdin of arbitrary program, stdout of that program replaces selection.For example, if you want to quickly test a function that takes a json string, and you're in a language where instantiating good mock   objects and serialising it takes quite a bit of code, you can quickly make a mock by writing JS code within the string quotes and have the code console.log json and then `vi'!node` will replace it there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Vim configuration is something deeply personal, but I'd recommend as a wise choice always explore first the default settings because assuming those in your workflow gives an huge advantage using any new unconfigured vim environment eg to get out of any of the edit modes &lt;C-c&gt; works by default and is a great choice.
To use CUA alike shortcuts there's already:
```
source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim
```
And finally, is also a good idea to get used to use &lt;Leader&gt; as a prefix for your own shortcuts, in my case I use the space bar as &lt;Leader&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990801</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was once offered an engineering manager position at iridium (which i discussed here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41748519)-- that entire company is a race to reduce the bottom line. They offered me (an engineering manager to 5 engineers) a lower salary than I was offered as a new grad. Also their talent pipeline is quite stale, most of the engineers on my prospective team were at the org for 10-20 years. For such an interesting aspect of technology, it's ashame they can't attract more talent, such an untapped market low earth orbit satellite networks are...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Eccentric Orbits: The Iridium Story" by John Bloom is a must-read for anyone remotely interested in satellites, communication networks, or corporate management. The project achieved several outstanding engineering feats, then fumbled into an almost unrecoverable position, then rose from the ashes into the small niche it holds today.Plus, "Early calculations showed that 77 satellites would be needed, hence the name Iridium", is an eternally cool piece of trivia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My guess is, that similar flaws have been known and exploited for ages. I doubt that iridium was ever truly safe to begin with.
I was recently looking into renting an iridium satellite modem and while doing so, I found a pdf on some shady private intelligence agencies website that documented a tool to intercept calls and messages as well as locating users of the network. The screenshots looked like a late 90s, early 2000s windows ui and talked about special radio equipment that the tool interfaces with.Search for "Iridium Interception System reference manual pdf"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43037623</guid></item><item><title>36.

The whole goal of these deals is to transfer tech and knowhow to the competitors in the US. Threats of tariffs is irrelevant I think as the US also wants to put tariffs on China.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ad interrupted my video today, it was Tom Hanks in a podcast talking about his prostate.The ad was (not so obviously) AI generated; both an AI clone of his voice and an AI-generated face-swap/ lip replacement.This seemed pretty surprising because it was fairly convincing. He looks like he is saying the dialog of the ad.It's surprising because there's no way the creator of the ad got Hanks' approval to use his likeness; meanwhile Youtube is profiting by selling the ad. Seems illegal, yet i'm forced to watch the garbage.The ad in general is part of a similar trend I've been seeing of these AI generated voices speaking fast about prostates or large eggplants (if you know what I mean) used with influencers' or podcasters'  likenesses. I would never click on the garbage, and it's probably a scam anyway.I just scratch my head wondering if this massive company realizes the garbage they are forcing into our lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Robyn: To give YouTube a sense of motion, we created a dynamic red-to-magenta gradient. For the second color, orange and yellow were strong contenders, but magenta felt like the most natural pairing with our new red. Interestingly, magenta doesn't often appear in the natural world, so it symbolizes the imagination and evolution that YouTube embodies. We also placed the gradient at a 45-degree angle with magenta on the right, signifying forward movement.Kinda reminds me of this quotehttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf&gt; There will be rich debates about the socioeconomic implications of Helvetica Light, and at some point, you will have to decide whether serifs are daring statements of modernity, or tools of hegemonic oppression that implicitly support feudalism and illiteracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A comment I made when I started noticing the magenta gradient at the end of the progress bar: it's a bit anxiety-inducing for those who remember needing to degauss their monitors, because it looks almost exactly like when you mess up a CRT with a magnet.(Aside from that: not a fan, it makes the chrome of the video player more distracting.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43031545</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the advantages of using Scala as a programming language, highlighting its features that blend functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It emphasizes Scala's interoperability with Java, concise syntax, and powerful features such as pattern matching and immutability, which enhance productivity and maintainability in software development. The discussion also touches on Scala's strong type system, which helps reduce runtime errors, and its growing popularity in data processing and scalable systems, making it an appealing choice for modern programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best config system I've ever seen used plain old Python to generate static configs. Everyone knows Python. Python is easy to do data munging in, as demonstrated by it's popularity as the #1 data science tool. There's boundless libraries to make Python more functional, use stricter typing, or reduce the amount of side effects it can cause. Even Starlark is just a dialect of Python.You can spend decades building a complicated configuration language, use a bespoke functional language as Mill does, but if you're a single company that can enforce code quality and just wants to get the job done, I feel like everything else is just unnecessary and over-engineered to scratch some academic itch for a "better system" that enforces "purity" at the cost of velocity.I also think that now that LLMs are on the rage, how much context do you think they have for bespoke config language vs Scala vs Python? I think we know the answer to that one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article fails to mention whether Scala can ensure code is deterministic and hermetic. Starlark code is deterministic and hermetic, but the article never mentions this. Unfortunately, Starlark does not have static typing, but I think types would make Starlark one of the best languages today for build configuration.In the Clojure community, there was a huge push for "builds are programs". I somewhat agree with this assertion, but I also think "one should restrict the class of programs a build belongs to". Neither Clojure nor Scala, compared to Starlark, seem to offer a way to ensure builds belong to a deterministic subset of programs.Thus I am still wondering "why Scala?". I have never used Scala, but reading this whole article gives me the impression that Mill is the Scala equivalent of Clojure's tools.build. That is not what I would want in a build system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mill is a fast, scalable, multi-language build tool that supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Python".So, while I understand this tool can resonate in the JVM world, I have no idea why one would want to pull Java into their toolset in order to build Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42997496</guid></item><item><title>43.

There was an HN post about this a few weeks ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42790536&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat idea.  Random initial impressions:* On search listings, make clicking anywhere in the rounded-rectangle for the search hit go to the details view.  (Actually, maybe make the whole rectangle a hyperlink, so people can middle-click and do all the normal browser link things with it.)* On the detail view, there's no obvious button to go back to the search view.  Even if you support old-school browser back feature, which is commendable, you might want to also have a button/link.* On the detail view, the Twitter/X logo button in the upper right corner of the window almost looks like a close-window X like we see on some other sites for going back to the search view.* You might want to make a clear argument for why people should use this instead of a liquidator, eBay, CraigsList, Facebook Marketplace, etc.  (As a buyer, I'm thinking maybe I can find a deal here because there's not many other buyers.  But as a seller who just lost their startup, I'd be thinking what's the easiest way to make these Aeron chairs and standing desks go away, with money a second priority, since there are better uses of my time and storage space.)* You have a spam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dunno about Herman Miller but my local Steelcase dealer (an hour away) was pretty pissed when I showed up wanting repairs for a chair I bought on eBay.(Personally I can't sit in the Aeron,  the mesh causes my hamstrings to explode in pain,  so I could care less that I have a Herman Miller dealer in town.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43037600</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the transition from the WHOIS protocol to the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) in the context of domain name registration data. It outlines the reasons for this evolution, emphasizing improved privacy, security, and data accuracy. RDAP aims to provide a more standardized and efficient way for accessing registration data, addressing limitations of the traditional WHOIS system. The article highlights the benefits of RDAP, including better support for internationalization and enhanced user experience, while encouraging stakeholders to adapt to the changes and embrace the new protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently updating my organization's RDAP system up to the latest ICANN profile so please forgive me if I sound a little salty.What ICANN aren't admitting is that while there was no formal RFC standard to the output of WHOIS ICANN themselves had mandated the output format of the WHOIS output. To go live with your shiny new gTLD you had to pass a test of your whois server output. It was strict enough that we had to remove an extra blank line is the disclaimer at the end of the output.Every whois server I ever checked while writing my org's version supported UTF8.The data has to be publicly available so authentication and encryption doesn't matter. In any case there is currently nothing requiring RDAP servers to authenticate anything.The amount of search ability I've seen in most rdap servers so far is pretty limited.The RDAP output is json but its complicated and there are so many options that realistically everyone is developing to pass the icann profile so no different to whois, and in the end we still live in a post GDRP world so all the useful data is redacted so none of this matters anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using Whois every now and then to ban ip ranges outside the USA where there is suspicious activity coming from.The variety of responses is a lot.  And it seems like you’re not required to provide accurate information other than just one field (ipaddr or something like that). For example I’ll see an allocation that has over a million addresses but in their Whois text they say they’re a /24 network (256 addresses). This happens with Chinese networks every single time so I have to calculate the correct network…(Sorry, commuting right now so I can’t show examples here)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big problem there is no easy and consistent way to query RDAP because there are no clients in Debian or Ubuntu. There is one in the experimental stage [1] in Debian, so perhaps in Debian 14?And yes, I know, there are Perl-Apps [2], Go-Apps [3] and so on which can be installed within minutes. But this extra step (including debugging which happens when compiling/installing from source) isn't going to help RDAP to get traction.[1] https://packages.debian.org/experimental/rdap

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group, where the company is being accused of neglecting the care of elderly patients in its insurance plans, potentially leading to inadequate treatment for serious health issues. The lawsuit highlights systemic issues in how the insurance giant manages care for vulnerable populations, raising concerns about the prioritization of profit over patient well-being. Advocates for the elderly argue that the lack of proper care delivery has resulted in significant harm to patients, prompting calls for accountability and reform in the insurance industry’s approach to senior health care.&lt;/p&gt;

I had insurance (it might have even been UHC, but I'm not 100% sure), so we went to an ophthalmologist's office, to get it looked at.When we get to the office, we find out that just the copay for this was going to be $550.  I was kind of crap at saving money back then, and I had a job that didn't pay great, and I remember I had exactly $578.23 in my bank account at the time, and I still needed to pay my rent.  I had to kind of awkwardly tell my wife "sorry, we don't have the money to have your eye looked at and pay our rent", so we leave without her getting any treatment.About 4-5 months later, I got a better job with much better health insurance, so she went to that same ophthalmologist, and our copay was less than $50.  The entirety of the work that this ophthalmologist did was refer her to a retinal specialist.This means that I was initially going to have paid more than $500 just to get a god damned referral, and just to re-emphasize this, we had health insurance.I remember how upset and frustrated I was with that entire situation; it felt like I was doing things the "right" way by getting a desk job with health insurance and yet I still couldn't afford to get the treatment that my wife needed. It just felt...unfair? Like what exactly was I supposed to do differently here?It didn't really "change" my perspective on this, I had already been in favor of moving to a universal healthcare system, but this thoroughly solidified my perspective on it.[1] Fortunately, it wasn't that, it was an autoimmune thing.  Still not great but better than we initially thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What i  don’t get is that the US system is not only super expensive but also totally clunky. As patient you need to track who is in an out of network, nobody can tell you how much something will cost, provider directories by the insurance are often wrong, hospitals constantly make mistakes, insurance denies valid claims, insurance gives you wrong info, ambulance may 5000 or 0, nobody knows, cash prices may be cheaper than going through insurance . It almost feels like as patient you need to program the system in assembly where you need to know every little detail of the system without any documentation.  Nothing makes sense but everything costs a lot of money.At a minimum there should be regulation (I know it’s a bad word now) to make the system easy to use without costly traps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a problem with "Medicare Advantage", which is an HMO scheme. The Government pays the HMO a flat fee per patient, and they try to minimize expenses.
Don't take that route. For now, "Traditional Medicare" plus a commercial supplement is a far safer deal.However, this may change. See [1], p. 465, which proposes to make "Medicare Advantage" the default."Medicare Advantage (MA), a system of competing
private health plans, is the major alternative to traditional Medicare for
America’s large and growing cohort of seniors. The program provides
beneficiaries with a wide range of competitive health plan choices—a richer
set of benefits than traditional Medicare provides and at a reasonable cost.
Equally as important, the MA program has been registering consistently
high marks for superior performance in delivering high-quality care.
Critical reforms are still needed to strengthen and improve the program for
the future. Specifically: 1. Make Medicare Advantage the default enrollment option. ...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Monzo, a digital bank, has developed a strategy to handle complete cloud outages efficiently. It outlines the steps taken to ensure continuity of service during such events by implementing a "stand-in" system that allows core banking functions to operate independently of cloud infrastructure. The piece highlights the importance of resilience and reliability in banking services, detailing the challenges faced during outages and the lessons learned that contribute to enhancing system robustness for future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I wonder is “have they isolated third party dependencies?” If AWS is hard down, those may well be impacted—in some cases, by their own third party dependencies. You can test turning off your AWS environment, but you can’t really test turning off S3 for everyone…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unrelated tangent: I was reading the article and suddenly realised that I could not identify the font. After a quick search:&gt; Our functional typeface is Monzo Sans, a custom cut of Universal Sans, meaning it’s unique to Monzo. We chose it for maximum readability, with generous dots and curled ends.Intersting choice, but I dig it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems especially relevant given the massive outage that Barclays, another major UK bank just suffered. Barclays was down for around two days with customers unable to spend money at all.I suppose had they implemented a similar system, they would have degraded into a minimum viable banking system rather than the total outage that impacted so many brits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43039347</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses trunk-based development (TBD), a software development approach where all developers work in a single branch (the trunk) rather than using long-lived feature branches. This method promotes continuous integration and reduced integration problems, enabling teams to deliver features more rapidly and with greater collaboration. The piece also highlights best practices for implementing TBD, such as keeping work in progress minimal, frequent merging, and fostering a culture of collaboration among team members. Overall, TBD is positioned as a powerful strategy to enhance Agile development and improve productivity and code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is content marketing for a feature flagging tool called “Bucket.” I’m a big fan of trunk-based development, although I prefer its original name: continuous integration. (Sadly, that name has been coopted by tool vendors.)A better alternative to feature flags is keystone interfaces. It’s very simple: build your new feature without wiring it up to the UI (or API). Test it using automated tests that bypass the UI. When it’s ready, wire it up, manually confirm that the automated tests didn’t miss anything, and release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am strongly opposed to feature flags and conditionals in the code, unless absolutely necessary. If you don't remove deprecated features/branches, your code will end up unmaintainable. If you do remove them, the removal is (in my experience) worse than dealing with merge conflicts. Version control is designed for the exact problem of having multiple implementations exist and merging them as needed. Why roll your own obtuse version control by having all branches in the same file simultaneously when you can just use git to have them exist in parallel universes?There's value in putting a newly completed feature behind a feature flag so you can turn it off instantly in prod. There is much less value in putting dozens of not-yet-functional features behind feature flags that shouldn't be turned on for the next several weeks/months (or maybe never).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; On top of that, once you finally get a feature merged and deployed, it can often happen that there’s a bug causing users to have a poor experience. Since your new feature lives directly in the code, deactivating it requires rolling back the code you merged, building it, waiting for the tests to run, and redeploying the applicationWhy aren’t you using feature flags to gate new behavior/functionality?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999413</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the abrupt termination of a popular text-to-speech (TTS) service on Twitch, which prominently featured the Doge meme's voice for comedic effect. The service had become widely used by streamers, creating a unique and entertaining interaction with their audiences. However, the decision to shut it down sparked backlash from the community who appreciated its humorous contributions to streams. The piece highlights the ongoing tension between tech moderation and user creativity, reflecting on the implications for streamers and the broader gaming culture.&lt;/p&gt;

That's not fun for anyone involved, but it's also not exactly crisis mode yet, and it seems like there are bigger things that this administration is doing to focus our pitchforks on?There's a very real risk of burning out people's ability to be indignant if we get up in arms about every obscure department that suffers moderate layoffs.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have had this lateral thinking game online for a while. The jist of the game is that one player asks a "host" a series of questions in order to reach a full understanding of what happened in a story, based on an initial premise.I have tried in the past at adding AI players but could never get reliable answers. However, as AI  has improved, I decided to give it another go. At the moment it is connected to deepseek v3 with some basic prompts, and it looks to handle the task pretty well. Not yet perfect but it definitely does form an impressive understanding of the stories, and the game itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wording of the questions really impacts the AI answers. For the elevator one,"Did Colin start on a lower floor than 6 to start?" "Yes""Did Colin Press the up button on the elevator?" "I don't know"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried several of these but never really got see the lateral thinking because the solutions were trivial on the first guess. It feels like no effort went into the contents of the mysteries themselves and they were sourced using AI.Which is to say, that they're all extremely shop-worn cliches. I think this shows the false allure of the AI product. The creator's low standards for content take what could be something interesting and a perfectly nice looking site and turns it into something which only superficially appears to be interesting but has no value.I've noticed this a lot with AI-based products: even their creators don't find the experience good, but they are imagining there exists an audience which doesn't value graphics and doesn't value the written word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42994749</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is hindering technology adoption across various industries rather than facilitating it. It argues that reliance on AI can create dependency and discourage innovation, as organizations may prefer to use existing AI tools rather than explore new approaches or technologies. The author emphasizes the importance of balancing AI integration with fostering an environment that encourages experimentation and adoption of diverse technological solutions to drive true progress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No, AI isn't.Any new tech, or version upgrade, or whatever, takes time for people to become familiar with it. You might as well say "Stack Overflow is stifling new tech adoption" because brand-new stuff doesn't have many Q's and A's yet. But that would be a silly thing to say.I'm not going to adopt a brand-new database regardless of LLM training data cutoff, just because enough people haven't had enough experience with it.And LLM's have a commercial incentive to retrain every so often anyways. It's not like we're going to confront a situation where an LLM doesn't know anything about tech that come out 5 or 10 years ago.Early adopters will be early adopters. And early adopters aren't the kind of people relying on an LLM to tell them what to try out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that is interesting is that this was anticipated by the OpenAI Codex paper (which led to GitHub Copilot) all the way back in 2021:&gt; Users might be more inclined to accept the Codex answer under the assumption that the package it suggests is the one with which Codex will be more helpful. As a result, certain players might become more entrenched in the package market and Codex might not be aware of new packages developed after the training data was originally gathered. Further, for already existing packages, the model may make suggestions for deprecated methods. This could increase open-source developers’ incentive to maintain backward compatibility, which could pose challenges given that open-source projects are often under-resourced (Eghbal, 2020; Trinkenreich et al., 2021).https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374 (Appendix H.4)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think if you specify a technology in your prompt, any LLM should use that technology in its response. If you don't specify a technology, and that is an important consideration in the answer, it should clarify and ask about technology choices, and if you don't know, it can make a recommendation.LLMs should not have hard-wired preferences through providers' prompt structure.And while LLMs are stochastic parrots, and are likely to infer React if a lot of the training corpus mentions React, work should be done to actively prevent biases like this. If we can't get this right with JS frameworks, how are we going to solve it for more nuanced structural biases around ethnicity, gender, religion or political perspective?What I'm most concerned about here is that Anthropic is taking investment from tech firms who vendor dev tooling - it would not take much for them to "prefer" one of those proprietary toolchains. We might not have much of a problem with React today, but what if your choice of LLM started to determine if you could or couldn't get recommendations on AWS vs Azure vs GCP vs bare metal/roll your own? Or if it suggested only commercial tools instead of F/LOSS?And to take that to its logical conclusion, if that's happening, how do I know that the history assignment a kid is asking for help with isn't sneaking in an extreme viewpoint - and I don't care if it's extreme left or right, just warped by a political philosophy to be disconnected from truth - that the kid just accepts as truth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43047792</guid></item><item><title>2.

We used a neural network model in excel for such purposes.He was (and hope he still is!) a great person, who taught me being curious and insightful in the computer science field. Taught me about Donald Knuth, TeX and many more things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dawkins gave a concise explanation of the evolution of the eye here as well:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X1iwLqM2t0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is probably more a physics/CS question than a biological one, but how far off are we from having physics simulators good enough to try the types of experiments MIT did with the eye but for entire organisms? Presuming that will one-day be possible (i.e. the simulation takes earth's physics as inputs, and spits out organisms vaguely similar to those found on earth), then we could presumably enter the physics of exoplanets and find out what their creatures might be like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43043063</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big complicated segmentation pipeline is a legacy from the time you had to do that, a few years ago. It's error prone, and even at it's best it robs the model of valuable context. You need that context if you want to take the step to handwriting. If you go to a group of human experts to help you decipher historical handwriting, the first thing they will tell you is that they need the whole document for context, not just the line or word you're interested in.We need to do end to end text recognition. Not "character recognition", it's not the characters we care about. Evaluating models with CER is also a bad idea. It frustrates me so much that text recognition is remaking all the mistakes of machine translation from 15+ years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From https://www.ocr4all.org/guide/user-guide/introduction :&gt; OCR4all is a software which is primarily geared towards the digital text recovery and recognition of early modern prints, whose elaborate printing types and mostly uneven layout challenge the abilities of most standard text recognition software.Looks like it's built on https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like a great project, and I don't want to nitpick, but...https://www.ocr4all.org/about/ocr4all

Next up, NYSE launches in Paris, Texas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045558</guid></item><item><title>6.

To keep it, they have to demonstrate they defend it.https://www.trademarkia.com/codeweavers-76546826While this project drops the final "s", you don't get to launch an OS called "Window". The test is a fuzzy match based on likelihood of confusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use the following for feeding into AI   find . -print -exec cat {} \; -exec echo \;

Which will return for each file (and subfolders) the filename and then the content of the file.Then `| pbcopy` to copy to clipboard and paste it into ChatGPT or similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tip: If you ever need to do this on a public GitHub repository you can use "gitingest".This will open a website that creates a copy of all the file contents of the repo (code, docs, ...)
It's a great tool to use when using new/obscure code with LLMs in my opinion.The UX is so just easy and great, change the URL from &lt;https://github.com/user_name/repo_name&gt; to &lt;https://gitingest.com/user_name/repo_name&gt;//edit: fixed URLs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43048027</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Edit prediction won't be free forever, but right now we're just excited to share and learn.I love Zed, and I'm happy to pay for AI stuff, but I won't be using this until they are done with their rug pull. Once I know how much it costs, I can decide if I want to try integrating it into my workflow. Only THEN will I want to try it, and would be interested in a limited free trial, even just 24 hours.Considering I've seen products like this range from free to hundreds of dollars per month, I'd rather not find out how good it is and then find out I can't afford it.Other than that for anyone wanting to try Zed:- You can only run one LSP per file type, so your Rust will work fine, your C++, too, your Angular will not.- Remote editing does not work on Windows (its not implemented at all), so if you are on windows, you cannot ssh into anything with the editor remote editing feature. This means you cannot use your PC as a thin client to the actual chunky big work machine like you can with vscode. I've seen a PR that adds windows ssh support, but it looked very stale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sensitive readers please be advised, quite a bit of a rant and angry reactions coming in an overreacting style, please stop here if you are of the sensitive type. The comments are unrelated to this particular product but aimed at the universal approach of the broad topic nowadays. Zero intent of offending anyone specific person is attempted.I am fed up with all these predicting what I want to do. Badly!! Don't guess! Wait, and I will do what I want to do. I do not appreciate it from my wife trying to figure out what I want to say in the middle of my senntence and interrupts before I finish what I am saying, imagine how much I tolerate it from a f computer! I know what I am going to do, you do not! Let me do that already! This level of predicting our asses off everywhere grown to be a f nuisance by now, I cannot simply do and focus on what I want to do because of the many distractions and suggestions and guesses and prediction of me and my actions all the f time are in the way' Wait, and see! At this overly eager level and pushing into everything is a nuisance now! Too many times the acceptance of the - wrong - 'helping suggestion' is in the way too, hijacking that usable elsewhere particular keyboard action, breaking my flow, dragging in the unwanted stupid guess! Recovery of my way of working from incoming and pushy "feature" hiding/colliding my usual actions, forced on me in a "security update" or other bullshit, turning off and recover the working practice already been in place and worked is an unwelcom being in the way too, ruined, now colliding with "smart prediction", not helping. In long term, it is not a definitive help but an around zero sum game. Locally, in specific sittuations, too many times it is a strong negative by the wrong done! Too much problems here and there, accuracy and implementation wise. Forced everywhere. Don't be a smartass, you are just an algorithm not a mind reader! Lay back and listen.If prediction is that smart - being with us since the turn of the millania here and there - then should do my job perfectly and I can go walk outside and collect the money! Until, f off!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like you can't run it locally. I don't like my code being sent to a third party, especially when my employer may not agree with it.I also edit secret/env files in my IDE, so for instance, a private key or API key could get sent, right?I hope there will be a local option later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045606</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to use WebAssembly (Wasm) with Go, highlighting the benefits of leveraging Wasm for building fast and efficient web applications. It presents a step-by-step guide on exporting Go functions to Wasm, enabling developers to run Go code in the browser. The piece emphasizes the simplicity of integrating Go with JavaScript and demonstrates how to set up a Go project that compiles to Wasm. Additionally, it touches on real-world applications and contexts where Wasm can enhance performance and portability for web development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A problem is that a Go produced WASM binary is really large. TinyGo overcomes this, but compiles too slow and you need to be really careful which libs to import (reflect). To overcome both, you need a lot of patience.If you want to tryout Go WASM on Cloudflare workers you need to buy a subscription due to the size of the binary. Last time I tried you could run hello-world, but anything more substantial exceeded the size threshold.Such a pity…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome. Something to keep in mind[0]:&gt; Remember that all the webassembly work in Go has been designed and implemented by volunteers, not the Go team, so timelines are dependent on availability of volunteers.[0]: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65333#issuecomment-22336...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems to me like it would have been more "Go" to simply export all functions starting with a capital letter in the main package, as exporting works normally in the language, only resorting to the compiler directive when you need to specifically name something starting with lowercase.Apparently this is just copying the existing way cgo exports work. Fair enough I guess, prior art. The ergonomics are just a little outside the language as usual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045698</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geoffrey, thanks for sharing your story with us. OR sure is a weird niche. Good enough algorithms for solving these problems have existed for decades1, but we still see low adoption and your 95% estimate of the companies not optimizing their operations rings true.Similarly to you, I spent a short while trying to sell VRP optimization with an API business model, and what dawned on me was that most companies do not have the necessary in-house expertise to integrate optimization into their existing tools even if the API is well-designed. There also really seems not to be any urgency to do that and most logistics companies just offload their inefficiencies onto their customers. Your routes are not effective? No problem, just bill more.Some years ago I heard about a Swedish team of optimization experts who got so fed up with selling optimization to unwilling transportation companies that they founded their own—just to mop the floor with their ineffective competition. :DI agree that ease of use is key here. In my PhD dissertation, I tried to address the issue by adding self-adaptivity within transportation management systems, mostly through automatic parameter tuning and algorithm selection. Such approaches remove some amount of fiddling when the optimization tool is adapted to a new optimization problem. Worth a look, perhaps, if you're interested.Many thanks again for the interesting article and all the best with Timefold.1) E.g., already by the '90s, we had quite capable algorithms for the VRP. I have open-sourced a library of classical VRP algorithms called VeRyPy, containing simple and not-so-simple heuristic algorithms. It has enjoyed modest success among VRP researchers and practitioners. Nowhere near the success of OptaPlanner, but also, the purpose is different—OptaPlanner is production-ready, whereas VeRyPy is more geared towards education and research purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that GOFAI companies are also calling themselves AI, because seriously why not. If a pile of linear algebra (fittingly trained on The Pile) can be AI, then so can optimizers and solvers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you for the hard work in this space! I think it is really important that there is a proper open source solution available.I just found OptaPlanner and subsequently TimeFold few months ago, as I was searching for a solution for my wife's veterinary clinics employee scheduling problem. The problem is not big enough for anyone to pay for the solution, but big enough to cause stress for whom ever is dealing with manually doings the shifts.It was interesting that there were a lot of online SaaS providers that claim to solve the problem but they just simply are not configurable for all kinds of constraints of a real workplace.Unfortunately I also feel partially same with TimeFold, because designing those constraints really requires changing the way of thinking of many problems. While the engine is capable of doing what ever, there is a steep learning curve to do it.So while the article mentions documentation, I would say that the documentation is far from sufficient for wide adaption.Personally, I would have really needed documentation about a mental model of thinking about the problem, and then a ton of examples how to solve real employee scheduling problems. Problem written in a format which the business people use and then translated into an elegant constraint rule explained step by step.I had to invest more than 40 hours to get a working MVP that solves real problems, not just those that are already coded in the example code. Most people are not willing to do that.What I'm trying to say is that to making planner software popular, it should be also usable for trivial projects. I understand that it's hard to focus on everything, but just providing more information about real use cases and how they were solved and how to think about the design problems would make the market bigger, and bring you a lot more customers in the long run.I just wonder how I might contribute to improve the documentation. I probably don't have deep enough understanding of the correct solution, but I will look into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42999454</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a thorough review of the evidence regarding causation, specifically examining whether variable X causes variable Y. It outlines the importance of understanding the distinction between correlation and causation, explores various research methodologies, and presents case studies to illustrate how different variables can be connected. Additionally, the piece emphasizes the need for critical analysis of existing studies, considering biases and confounding factors, while also advocating for a holistic approach to evaluate the broader context surrounding the evidence. Overall, it aims to enhance readers' comprehension of the complexities involved in establishing causal relationships in research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045406"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems very dismissive and unaware of recent advances in causal inference (cf other comments on Pearl). Putting "throw the kitchen sink at it" regression a la early 2000s nutritional research (which is indeed garbage in garbage out) in the same category as mendelian randomization, DAGs, IP weighting, and G-methods is misleading. I do worry that some of these EA types dive head-first into a random smattering of google scholar searches with no subject matter expertise, find a mess of studies, then conclude "ah well, better just trust my super rational bayesian priors!" instead of talking with a current subject matter expert. Research -- even observational research -- has changed a lot since the days of "one-week observational study on a few dozen preschoolers."A more general observation: If your conclusion after reading a bunch of studies is "wow I really don't understand the fancy math they're doing here" then usually you should do the work to understand that math before you conclude that it's all a load of crap. Not always, of course, but usually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my own research we are investigating how fluids cause changes in rocks that allow for mineralization of CO2 and have such problems of confounding variables (not terribly unique I suppose). One thing we note is that, well, fluid comes from the sky and goes into the ground. Thus, the deeper you go, the less fluid there is since the pathways from the sky to deep into the ground become more sparse as well as needing higher pressures to enter these regions to either overcome capillary pressures in existing fracture zones or to literally break the rock (which is highly unlikely using naturally occuring pressures from fluids from the sky). And so, literally everything in all the data sets correlates with depth in some way. But in what way? well this has many dependencies as well, did the rock that absorbed some of the fluids grow in volume because of a chemical change? are the fluid pathways currently connected? What kind of rock is absorbing the fluids? Are microbes in the fluid absorbing contents from the fluid that would otherwise be used for rock changes? and so you are left with this giant pile of data (tens of terabytes) without a clear connection between fluid and rock interactions except that there is less fluids from the sky the deeper you go into the rock. This is obvious, however it is also rather unhelpful when trying to understand the other processes that exist. Of course you might say, have you tried detrending your data? And the answer is yes and to no effect. The simple truth is that this depth dependency interacts in different ways with different systems and there is no easy way to figure out how it does for each sub-system such as the fluid rock chemistry interactions, the rock fracture mechanics, the subsequent methane and hydrogen that is produced and likely consumed by microbes, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a lot of these kinds of studies are not really about objectively studying a phenomenon but trying to prove a predetermined point. The study is designed and adjusted until it proves what it should prove. Then it's wrapped in a nice news headline which goes away with all the details and subtleties and used for political or economic gain. Reproducing the results is not interesting and not funded. Other studies are then using these results as sources to stack the house of cards even higher. I think this does a lot of harm to science as a whole because a lot of people  disregard all scientific results as a result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045406</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "A Neural Network Approach to Contextualized Word Representations" presents a method for generating word embeddings that capture the context in which words are used. The authors propose a neural network architecture designed to create contextualized representations, which consider both the semantic meaning and the syntactic role of words in different contexts. The research highlights improvements in performance on various natural language processing tasks by using these contextual embeddings compared to traditional static word representations. Overall, the approach aims to enhance understanding and processing of language through deep learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that the software is occasionally doing better than the supposed “ground truth” (who annotated that?), and I don't understand why the authors are blindly following the latter, and the reviewers apparently approved that.In Figure 1 the authors complain that Gemini “misreads 'ss ety!' as 'ness ety!'”, but even a casual look at the image reveals that Gemini's reading is correct.In Figure 11, they state that Claude is “altering the natural sequence of ideas in the ground truth”, except that the sequence in the ground truth makes no sense, while Claude's order does (only the initial “the” is misplaced).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks a lot like "compared to a bunch of people who are 10 years behind (non-transformer, vision-only models), and people who aren't trying (aren't optimizing for OCR) Google is doing real well"EasyOCR is LSTM-CTC from 2007, RapidOCR is a ConvNet approach from 2021, both focused on speed. Both will vastly outperform almost any transformer model, and certainly a big one, on speed and memory usage, but they aren't state of the art on accuracy. This is well known, for a decade at this point. 2 decades for LSTM-CTC.Plus, I must say the GPT-4o results look a lot saner. "COCONUT" (GPT-4o) vs "CONU CNBC" (Gemini) vs Ground Truth "C CONU CNBC". And, obviously the ground truth should be "COCONUT MILK" (the word milk is almost entirely out of the picture, but is still the right answer that a human would give). The "C CONU" comes from the first O of COCONUT being somewhat obscured by a drawing of ... I don't know what the hell that is. It's still very obvious it's meant to be "COCONUT MILK", so the GPT-4o answer is still not quite perfect, but heaps better than all the others.Now this looks very much like it might be temperature related, and I can find nothing in the paper about changing the temperature, which is imho a very big gap (temperature gives transformer models more freedom to choose more creative answers. The better performance of GPT-4o might well be the result of such a more creative choice, and might also explain why Gemini is trying so hard to stay so very close to the ground truth. It's still quite the accomplishment to succeed, but GPT-4o is still better)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The systems they tested against the LLMs are mostly used as a part of a larger system. A more fair comparison would be to use something like MinerU [1] and proper benchmark like the OHR Bench [2] and Reductos table bench [3].

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The skill required to cut through so many layers, going from php application down to linux kernel. Impressed and jealous!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author has identified the issue to be memcg reparenting causing a spike in CPU usage. Reparenting mostly solves a problem with zombie memcg, where the memcg lingers because some resource is still charged to it. In the extreme case you can end up with tens if thousands of zombies. The zombie memcg problem is not unique to cgroup v2, but reparenting is fairly recent.The article solves the cpu spike by disabling the io or memory controller, but if one would like to use those controllers, a better way to charge memory would be nice.It is unfortunate that it's clear where the memory should be charged, but the kernel does not provide reliable way to deterministically charge that memory. If anyone has any design ideas, please feel free to chime in!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting problem. The OP should have a look into how the vm.dirty_ratio, vm.dirty_background_ratio, vm.dirty_bytes, and vm.dirty_background_bytes (and other similarly prefixed) sysctl parameters control when the kernel starts flushing dirty pages to disk. Last time I checked, different distros defaulted things like dirty_ratio to somewhere between 10 and 50, mostly for legacy reasons.This is really not great in situations where you're bootstrapping a fresh server. Here's what happens:- you boot up a server with, say, 1tb RAM- your default dirty ratio is 10 (best case)- you quickly write 90gb of files to your server (images, whatever)- you get mad unblocked throughput as the page cache fills up &amp; the kernel hasn't even tried flushing anything to disk yet- your application starts, takes up 9gb memory- starts to serve requests, writes another 1gb of mem mapped cache- the kernel starts to flush, realises disk is slower than it thought, starts to trip over itself and aggressively throttle IO until it can catch up- your app is now IO bound while the kernel thrashes around for a bitThis can be tuned by adjusting the vm.dirty_* defaults, and is well worth doing IMO. The defaults that kernels still ship with are from a long time ago when we didn't have this much memory available.My memory of this next bit is flaky at best, so happy to be corrected here, but I remember this also being a big problem with k8s. With cgroups v1, a node would get added to your cluster and a pod would get scheduled there. The pod would be limited to, say, 4gb memory - way more memory than it actually uses - but it would have a lot of IO operations. Because the node still had a ton of free memory, way below its default dirty writeback ratio/bytes, none of the IO operations would get flushed to disk for ages, but the dirty pages in the page cache would still be counted towards that pod's memory usage even though they weren't 'real' memory, but something completely out of the control of the pod (or kubernetes, really). Before you knew it, bOOM. Pod oomkilled for seemingly no reason, and no way to do anything about it. I remember some issues where people skirted around it by looking off into middle distance and saying the usual things about k8s not being for stateful workloads, but it was really lame and really not talked about enough.This might seem unrelated, but you guessed it, it was fixed in cgroups v2, and I imagine that the fix for that problem either directly or indirectly explains why OP saw a difference in behaviour between cgroups v1 and v2.Also, slightly related, I remember discovering a while back that for workloads like this where you've got a high turnover of files &amp; processes, having the `discard` (trim) flag set on your ssd mount could really mess you up (definitely in ext4, not sure about xfs). It would prevent the page cache from evicting pages of deleted files without forcing writeback first, which is obviously the opposite of what it was designed to do (protect/trim the ssds). Not to mention cause all sorts of zombifications when terminated processes still had memmapped files that hadn't been flushed to disk, etc.AFAIK it's still a problem, though it's been years since I profiled this stuff. At peak load with io-intensive workloads, you could end up with SSDs making your app run slower. Try remounting without the `discard` flag (and periodically fstrim manually), or use `discard=async`, and see what difference it makes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43046174</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses common misconceptions about Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and their applications in software development and deployment. It highlights the differences between GPU and CPU capabilities, emphasizing that GPUs can handle specific tasks more efficiently, particularly in parallel processing scenarios such as machine learning and graphics rendering. The author argues that despite being underutilized or misunderstood in some contexts, GPUs offer significant advantages for certain workloads and should be considered in performance optimization strategies.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs. System engineers may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But software developers don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.I'm increasingly coming to the view that there is a big split among "software developers" and AI is exacerbating it.  There's an (increasingly small) group of software developers who don't like "magic" and want to understand where their code is running and what it's doing.  These developers gravitate toward open source solutions like Kubernetes, and often just want to rent a VPS or at most a managed K8s solution.  The other group (increasingly large) just wants to `git push` and be done with it, and they're willing to spend a lot of (usually their employer's) money to have that experience.  They don't want to have to understand DNS, linux, or anything else beyond whatever framework they are using.A company like fly.io absolutely appeals to the latter.  GPU instances at this point are very much appealing to the former.  I think you have to treat these two markets very differently from a marketing and product perspective.  Even though they both write code, they are otherwise radically different.  You can sell the latter group a lot of abstractions and automations without them needing to know any details, but the former group will care very much about the details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a timeline that I am still trying to work through but it goes like this :2012 - moores law basically ends -  nand gates do t get smaller just more cleverly wrapped. Single threaded execution more or less stops at 2 GHz and has remained there.2012-2022 - no one notices single threaded is stalled because everything moves to VMs in the cloud - the excess parallel compute from each generation is just shared out in data centres2022 - data centres realise there is no point buying the next generation of super chips with even more cores because you make massive capital investments but cannot shovel 10x or 100x processes in because Amdahls law means standard computing is not 100% parallel2022 - but look, LLMs are 100% parallel hence we can invest capital once again2024 - this is the bit that makes my noodle - wafer scale silicon. 900,000 cores with GBs SRAM - these monsters run Llama models 10x faster than A100sWe broke moores law and hardware just kept giving more parallel cores because that’s all they can do.And now software needs to find how to use that power - because dammit, someone can run their code 1 million times faster than a competitor - god knows what that means but it’s got to mean something - but AI surely cannot be the only way to use 1M cores?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My heart stopped for a moment when reading the title. I'm glad they haven't decided to axe GPUs, because fly GPU machines are FANTASTIC!Extremely fast to start on-demand, reliable and although a little bit pricy but not unreasonably so considering the alternatives.And the DX is amazing! it's just like any other fly machine, no new set of commands to learn. Deploy, logs, metrics, everything just works out of the box.Regarding the price: we've tried a well known cheaper alternative and every once in a while on restart inference performance was reduced by 90%. We never figured out why, but we never had any such problems on fly.If I'm using a cheaper "Marketplace" to run our AI workloads, I'm also not really clear on who has access to our customer's data. No such issues with fly GPUs.All that to say, fly GPUs are a game changer for us. I could wish only for lower prices and more regions, otherwise the product is already perfect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43053844</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of different layout models in web design, including traditional techniques like the box model and the newer CSS Grid and Flexbox. It explores how these models affect the way elements are arranged on a webpage, offering insights into their properties, strengths, and weaknesses. The author emphasizes the importance of choosing the right layout model based on the specific requirements of a project, and includes examples and visual aids to illustrate the concepts discussed. Overall, the article serves as a practical guide for web developers looking to enhance their layout design skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typst is a re-flowable document description language; TeX spends more computation on the One True text justification and hyphenation paragraph builder.PDF has recently implemented a limited reflow feature by marking up text elements with metadata tags originally introduced to add accessibility features, hints for text to speech...Meanwhile, Amazon has moved  new books and user-submitted documents from its own Kindle format to ePub.ePub is the e-book standard format that extends a subset of HTML.Web browser teams have been hurling themselves against the walls of nearly-intractable layout cases for decades now.We take it for granted: on your Kindle e-ink reader, change the font size. Boom: the whole book has to re-compute its layout.Typst is far more computationally efficient, even elegant, but as yet it can't flow text around embedded sidebars or images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a really great write-up, and gives me a lot of hope for the future of Typst. I think one of the best ways to overcome the enormous momentum of TeX is to point out its limitations (while still keeping an eye on Typst's limitations), and explain how Typst overcomes them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember in word for windows (Either 2 or 6, not sure) on my 40MHz 386, you could watch it reflowing text if you edited a paragraph near the beginning of a multi-page document.  It would correct for widows and orphans, which would cause surrounding pages to potentially do the same.  It could take a non-trivial amount of time to stabilize, and if you printed a document before it did, you could end up with duplicated or missing lines at page breaks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43032697</guid></item><item><title>15.

The dimensions are all over the place: first they say M is a N x d x d matrix, then it becomes N x d. And then they are trying to scale M with g_out and add it to E_attn which is a T x d matrix??? Are the gates scalars or vectors or matrices? If they are matrices then the dimensions also don't line up to M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missed opportunity to call them LMM and enjoy the onslaught of typos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The largest model they tested is 1.7B.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43042753</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turtles are my favorite animals (other than humans, and sometimes even more than them).Mostly I think they're just cute, which is by itself a perfectly valid reason for an animal to be your favorite, but I've always been fascinated by their ruggedness.  It's not weird for a turtle to live to 100 years old, and it feels like they can survive just about anything.Having a built-in GPS just makes them even cooler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “The big question is always the mechanism,” Goforth said. “What’s the mechanism and what is the sensor? We know that for the visual sense, you have eyes; for the sense of smell, you have a nose; and for hearing, you have ears. But no receptor like that has been identified for the magnetic sense, and the mechanism remains unknown.”Interesting, I just barely listened to a Radiolab episode about magnetoreception in birds today [1]. The mechanism is thought to be cryptochrome, a type of protein that exhibits quantum effects when exposed to blue light [2]. The RadioLab story mentioned this mechanism was first proposed in the 70s (I think?) and it was heresy at the time a didn’t get published. Now there’s a SciAm article about it [3], and lots of blog posts. I wonder why this isn’t mentioned? Isn’t there a pretty good chance the mechanism is the same?* edit: BTW while listening to the podcast I was reminded of Haidinger’s Brush [4] - the fact that many humans can see polarization, once they know what to look for. I wonder if it’s potentially related to navigation since the polarization effect is strongest at 90 degrees from the sun… i.e., generally north and south, in the morning and evening, for much of the earth.[1] https://radiolab.org/podcast/quantum-birds[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptochrome#Magnetoreception[3] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-migrating-bir...[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger's_brush&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My old man - an old-fashioned cat by anyone’s description — can pick true north anytime, anywhere. It’s made me wonder if he has some kind of internal magnetic compass. And now, having read this, I wonder if this ‘turtle skill’ is latent in humans but only emerges in a rare few.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43051465</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the history and impact of the "Helvetica" typeface, widely regarded as one of the most influential and utilitarian fonts in graphic design. It highlights its origins in Switzerland in the 1950s and its subsequent adoption in various industries, particularly in urban signage and branding in Manhattan. The piece reflects on the font's aesthetic appeal and versatility, while also discussing the cultural implications of its widespread use and the balance between functionality and artistry in font design. Overall, it emphasizes Helvetica's role as a symbol of modernity and communication in an urban environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm afraid the author has it backwards. This style of writing didn't start as a font from some company.This is just how you used to be taught to do lettering in a drafting class. The straight lines and simple shapes make it easy to do lettering with pencil or a pen, which is also why all the lines are the same width and all the line caps are rounded.Later on these turned into stencils, which let users do lettering quickly by tracing the pen inside the stencil - and then turned into fonts for use in print. But all that came later. What we have here is just lettering people learned in drafting classes, and which was later used to make stencils and templates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t mean this as a slight, but this has to be written by a post-millennial. As a late gen-Xer, nothing about these letterforms were unusual or “ugly” to me as they were practically ubiquitous.  They were just as common and valid as standard printed forms.I suppose it’s something like how a modern reader might react to seeing a “long s” — ſ — for the first time.Again, this isn’t meant to insult anyone, just that it’s really fascinating to see a different generational perspective here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bit of a meta-comment. Something about this piece hits exactly the sweet spot of length and complexity for engaging but still accessible prose, which I feel like has become rarer over time, replaced by the modern writing of instant gratification. (Whether less is being produced, or it's less prominent, or whether the other kinds have become more prominent, I can't say for sure.) I really appreciated it, independent of the subject matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43053419</guid></item><item><title>18.

If you put up a blog online, available publicly, do you really care if I read it in my terminal or via Firefox with uBlock? Or via an AI agent that fetches the article for me and tags it for me for further categorization?It seems like suddenly half the internet forgot about the term "user-agent", which up until recently was almost always our browsers, but sometimes feed readers, which was acceptable it seems. But now we have a new user-agent available, "AI Agents", that somehow is unacceptable and should be blocked?I'm not sure I agree with the premise that certain user-agents should be blocked, and I'll probably continue to let everyone chose their own user-agent when using my websites, it's literally one of the reasons I use the web and internet in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been flagged as a bot on pretty much every major platform. Most ridiculously lately, linkedin - I have to prove my identity using 2 different forms of ID, which they still won't accept, OR find a notary and somehow prove I own the account I no longer have access to. Maybe try refining this tech a little better before you start blasting legitimate users with it - I am extremely skeptical of the catch rate given what I see anecdotally online, and my own experience getting flagged for stuff as benign as being a quick typist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fully expect captchas to incorporate "type the racial slur / death threat into the box" soon, as the widely available models will balk at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43049959</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Network Address Translation (NAT) negatively impacts low-power devices, particularly in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). It explains that NAT complicates direct device communication, which is essential for efficient low-power operation and can lead to increased latency and power consumption. The author emphasizes the importance of direct connectivity for these devices, suggesting alternatives such as IPv6 as a potential solution to improve connection reliability and energy efficiency in IoT applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem(-s) described in the blog post are really acute for IoT in general, especially if you want your device to run on batteries or you have a limited data budget.&gt; Therefore, when you try to continue talking to the server over a previously established session, it will not recognize you. This means you’ll have to re-establish the session, which typically involves expensive cryptographic operations and sending a handful of messages back and forth before actually delivering the data you were interested in sending originally.The blog post mentions Session IDs as a solution, but these require servers to be stateful, which can be challenging in most deployments. An alternative is Session Tickets (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5077), but these may cause issues when offloading networking to another device, such as a cellular modem, as their implementation may be non-standard or faulty.incoming rantThese issues could be mitigated—or even solved—by using mature software platforms like Zephyr RTOS and their native networking stacks, which receive more frequent updates than traditional “all-in-one-package” SoCs. However, many corporations choose to save a few dollars on hardware at the expense of incurring thousands in software engineering costs and bug-hunting. It is often seen as more cost-effective to purchase a cellular modem with an internal MCU rather than a separate cellular modem and a host MCU to run the networking stack. It is one of the many reasons why many IoT devices are utter garbage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I want from platforms, and I fought for at one time in Google with no success: a platform API that provides applications a way to schedule packets when the radio turns on.The mobile platforms in particular continue to assume that you can live with their high level HTTP stuff, and it's just not good enough. The non-mobile platforms largely don't even approach the problem at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That NAT is a problem presumes that we actually want our IoT devices reaching out to the out-of-intranet zone.NAT gets the blame, and the intranet as a concept is generally a big corp term.But I prefer my IoT devices not to need to reach out of my network. For me, NAT is an unwitting ally in the fight against such nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43003999</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Ricochet is an open-source instant messaging application that focuses on privacy and security by using the Tor network for anonymous communication. It allows users to chat without revealing their IP addresses or any personal information, as messages are routed through the Tor network. The platform offers end-to-end encryption for conversations and supports features like direct messaging, file sharing, and contact management. Ricochet is designed to be user-friendly while prioritizing the protection of user identities and communications from surveillance and censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

To identify the perpetrators, German police used a correlation analysis attack. By sending Ricochet messages to perpetrators and monitoring several hundred Tor nodes for simultaneous traffic of the correct size, authorities were able to identify intermediate Tor nodes and then also the perpetrator's entry nodes, revealing the perpetrators' IP addresses.From wikipedia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with all anonymous communication systems is that they suffer from network effects even more than traditional communication systems. By having few people use it you immediately expose yourself by being part of a small group of people using it, becoming an easy target. Unfortunately the reality is that it’s often easier to hide as a needle in a haystack on something like WhatsApp than it is to use a theoretically anonymous communication system that lacks the “haystack” altogether&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like a good idea... sadly the latest release is from 8y ago. :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43046192</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked there for more than a decade, and I can never highlight enough:- How great the place was for those involved in the open-source ecosystem- How great Novell and Attachmate were as ownersThe company had, like many others, good and tough times, but the people were very passionate about it.I will never stop feeling lucky for it being part of me for so many years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SuSE doesn’t get enough credit for the quality of the distribution. Transactional updates, serious work towards a reproducible distribution, nano as an excellent container runtime, stability under large workloads - it’s a nice piece of engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SUSE has always been this perennial figure in the Linux world for me; the Linux Distro that isn't talked about often, but is generally liked and respected, by most people who use it.I ran OpenSUSE for about a year in 2013-2014, and it did sort of have the Just Works nature to it: things did more or less what I expected them to do without much tinkering. It was the first Linux that I liked enough to be my sole operating system instead of dual booting, which should say something by itself.I stopped running OpenSUSE because I bought a new laptop which had Nvidia Optimus, and someone told me that that was easier to get working with Arch, so that's what I did, and I haven't really touched SUSE since, but I will always respect it for getting me interested in Linux and open source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43048261</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because certain concepts have been repeated so often they've become elements of faith (e.g., "taxes are too high", "government is filled with fraud and waste", "taxing the 1% will solve our country's financial problems"), careful conversation about the complexities of the modern world is difficult to have.I think that complex solutions CAN be grasped by the large majority of voters, but their time and attention are so captured by sloganeers that they aren't exposed to the explanations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've noticed this a lot with climate science, especially. People are waiting for a silver bullet that will reverse climate change and I think in reality, it will have to be a huge, complex, coordinated effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple, obvious answers appeal to a broader, less-knowledgeable set of people. In fact, it really doesn't matter if there is any basis for the answer, like a lower-dimensional approximation. If repeated enough, more people tend to believe the simple, baseless answer. I feel this is a bigger issue these days than needing to use more complex answers among people who understand the complexity of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43053625</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a flashback to the xscreensaver fights with Debian of yore, given that the entire fight seems to distill to "OBS is shipping EOL Qt because of unfixed regressions in newer Qt, Fedora views shipping EOL Qt as unjustifiable neglect and repackaged it with newer Qt, which, as described, breaks things." [1]For those who don't have that in their context - jwz got very upset at people reporting bugs against xscreensaver that had been fixed for a long time in upstream but e.g. Debian doesn't just ship upstream updates every 30 minutes. He requested Debian stop shipping it (or update it? I didn't go reread the entire chain before replying), Debian declined.He then put in a piece of code that popped up a notification if the system time was sufficiently far past the hardcoded value, informing people they should upgrade, and Debian debated patching his message out.[1] - jwz dot org/blog/2016/04/i-would-like-debian-to-stop-shipping-xscreensaver/(Link turned into not a link because I had forgotten how jwz feels about HN referrers.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would fedora have their own version of OBS studio when the package is already supported  by the official team on flathub? Isn't this exactly the reason why flatpak was created, to avoid all the needless packaging that every distro had to do in order to install the program?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last time I checked, Flathub was rife with unofficial packages posing as official ones (using the URL of upstream, with no verification, when the upstream dev has no association to the package).That's the main reason I never took Flatpak seriously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43042985</guid></item><item><title>28.

I wish I had 1/10th the zeal and entrepreneurship his Dad(and seemingly his uncle) had.The only thing I didn't quite grasp is this excerpt.  I feel like it's implying something I don't pick up.
Is it saying they didn't work together?  Was sending the sample sets rude?&gt; He did make a final good-faith effort to partner with the sport's originator, Wayne Godinet, offering to purchase $20,000 worth of product. It was almost a third of the profit earned from reselling the Japanese shipment. Godinet sent back two sample sets with a bill for the cost of goods and shipping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The infamous "Oh my gosh!" scream in Skrillex's "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" was sampled from a viral sport stacking video from 2008.The story fits!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonderfully written and a rare exemplar of the rise of a fad from its primary source.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There has been some research done on this particular anonymous newsgroup.“Deanonymising alt anonymous messages”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5JBMyxvuH8The accompanying blog post is here:https://ritter.vg/blog-deanonymizing_amm.htmlThe inherent security of the technique is actually quite strong. The tooling is terrible and many other problems exist with AAM, but in general the idea of having a shared “inbox” is good for anonymity. There is no way to tell which message is intended for whom. Receiving messages is unlinked, which is obviously good for anonymity. Sending requires a different set of technologies to ensure that the message delivery is unlinked. Tor solves part of this problem.AAM had serious limitations. Things fall down a bit with the underlying technology for newsgroups and PGP and so on not being designed for anonymity, “fail closed” security, or ease of use (and difficulty of misuse).A bespoke system could work, but the limiting factor is selecting an “inbox” that is widely distributed and heavily used (the anonymity is directly correlated to how many people access the inbox/inbox container.)# Case Study: YardBird’s group (mostly) escapes arrestA similar method for secrecy was used by a CSAM group. It was penetrated by the police when they arrested a member who turned informant to reduce his sentence. The police monitored the group from inside for months (I remember it being over a year). Despite having complete access to all the communications and technical surveillance data and international cooperation between police forces, the majority of the group evaded arrest.There was a set of operating rules that the group followed and everyone who did so escaped the net. I wrote about it in 2013 if anyone is interested in digging deeper into the story.https://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some time ago I created a chat that uses the same principles, it's funny to have some ideas validated by something that has been around for over 20 years and that I didn't know existed.https://github.com/domingues/vortex/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would like to see something like this that can scale to 100B+ messages per day (ie. A world scale messaging app), whilst still not revealing who is talking to who.Clearly the 'send all messages to everyone' approach cannot.But I wonder if there is an approach that can, with the added complexity that the users use mobile devices and care about battery life and bandwidth usage.I suspect there is not a design that can still provide anonymity against an attacker who can see all network traffic, but if there is, I'd like to know about it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43022824</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to All Things Open and asked booth staff (of corporate booths) “do you contribute to open source at your day job?”All were a little surprised by the question. Most interpreted it as “do you release and maintain your own open source software under the banner of your company.” When I clarified that I would count spending time to make a quality issue reproduction or fixing a bug and sending a PR, I got one person who said they had. They sent a patch to fix a bug, when I dug in why: they told me there were zero workarounds and the bug blocked a critical feature, if they didn’t upstream a fix successfully they would have to fork and take on maintenance (of that fork).I share this, because I feel that the many developers don’t quite realize that they are able to do these actions (bystander effect). And many don’t know how to speak up and advocate for that work in a professional setting.It’s true that corporate ties to open source are pervasive. I also feel that there’s a huge untapped potential of people who are willing to contribute but aren’t ready or aren’t able.My talk (on teaching developers how to contribute to open source) wasn’t recorded, but a longer, earlier version was at PhillyETE https://chariotsolutions.com/screencast/philly-ete-2023-how-.... I also maintain a free service for contributors getting started https://www.codetriage.com/ and wrote a paid book on the topic https://howtoopensource.dev/.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should update mental models of who works on open source accordingly [corporations vs individuals]I would like to see some numbers on how much code labeled "open source" (as opposed to having more of a free software ideology) is contributed by corporations and their employees, versus individualsI think it's been very clear for 20+ years that the largest open source projects have corporate origins, or big corporate contributors, as I mentioned here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35941074   (Linux kernel, LLVM, Firefox, Chrome, MySQL, JVM, VSCode, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.)But I wonder what happens when you look at medium size projects and libraries, like those in PyPI, NPM, the Go or Rust package ecosystems, etc.Are corporations contributing closer to 20% of the code, or 80% of the code?  I think there is a lot of code contributed by medium size companies, e.g. in the PHP ecosystem there seem to be many little companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People have pointed out for decades now that the OSI is a corporate alternative to free software. That was always the complaint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43042157</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When I first ran into this issue back in 2017, I posted in the React issue tracker that I had ”fixed” my app by blocking translation entirely.Please do not do this! In almost every instance I've encountered severe Translate-related broken-ness, it's still worked well enough to get me a snapshot of the current page translated. Fighting through this is still less cumbersome than the alternatives.&gt; The only alternative solution that I can think of, is to implement your own localization within your app (i.e. internationalization)I will add, please make sure that language is an independent setting, and not derived from locale! I sometimes have to use translate on sites that have my preferred language available, but won't show it to me because it's tied to locale and that changes other things that I don't want, like currency.On one such site I used a browser extension to rewrite the request for the language strings file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to learn this the hard way when a React app I built showed random crashes I couldn't explain."Fortunately" it also auto-translated the "I happily accept the terms of use" checkbox in one case into (back-translated) "I happily dying die perish", which also couldn't be clicked. That lead to a very high priority ticket and made us realize that all DOM manipulators might break the site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the fundamental problem is the DOM is too inefficient to do applications on it. No surprise there, considering the original design of HTML was for presenting information, not for interactive applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023338</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the concept of feature flags, a development technique used to enable or disable certain functionalities in software applications without deploying new code. It outlines the benefits of using feature flags, such as allowing for gradual rollouts, testing new features in production, and minimizing risk during updates. The site also highlights best practices for implementing feature flags, emphasizes the importance of managing them effectively to avoid technical debt, and suggests tools and libraries that can assist in utilizing feature flags in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see an old article of mine referred in that article (A Taxonomy of Variability Realization Techniques). Not my best work. The publishing date reflects that. We wrote most of that while I was still living in Sweden (I moved away in 2000), I completed my Ph. D. in 2002 and and after a post doc left the academic world in 2004. This paper was bounced around editorial boards for a while before we finally got it published.In any case, the thing that we tried to make clear with that paper is that there are different ways to make software do different things (variability) and that these techniques have trade offs. That's still true today and people using the wrong ones make life harder for themselves and their users.The main trade off is when you have to lock in your choice. With compile or build time feature flags, you are stuck with whatever you set before you ship the binary. You can't change it after. A change will require users to update their software. Configuration gives more flexibility. That breaks into runtime configuration and before runtime configuration.The broader context here is the notion of companies that build multiple products using the same code base. How do they differentiate products from each other. How do they create new variants. And how do these get configured. Some companies cam up with really complicated ways to do this. The further back you have to go to change a choice (e.g. making source file change vs. setting a checkbox in a configuration screen), the more expensive it gets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While documentation is often disliked, it is essential for configuration options, because [...] options are only added to a text file with a one-line comment at best.This resonates. Feature Flags over time devolve into a lovely career of code archaeology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read a thought-provoking article here about feature flags, entitlements, keeping them in but using a database or decoupling something something. Anyone remember the one? I am trying to grasp a principled way to collectively approach feature flags, entitlements, and authz.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43009117</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a solution to the ABA problem in the context of Rust programming and tagged pointers. It explains how the ABA problem arises in concurrent programming, particularly in lock-free data structures, where a location may have been changed from an old value to a new value and back to the old value, leading to false assumptions about the state. The author introduces a tagged pointer approach to address this issue, highlighting the benefits of using tags to distinguish between versions of data and ensure safe memory management in Rust. The article provides code examples and explanations to clarify how this technique can be effectively implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The slotmap crate [0], which stores an unordered object list in a Vec with persistent indices, implements a similar tagging scheme to avoid ABA problems. It's neat to see how this can be applied to raw pointers as well.[0] https://docs.rs/slotmap/latest/slotmap/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A much better solution to the ABA problem is to use load-linked and store-conditional instructions [1] on platforms where they are available (ARM, RISC-V, etc.)Unfortunately x86 is not one of them. That's when CMPXCHG16B on x86-64 comes in handy, as per the linked article. But if you're going to write library code in 2025, it should at least support x86 and ARM.Which brings up a more interesting argument IMO: platform fragmentation. Rust has approximately 1.5 advantages over C/C++. To displace them in a reasonable time, it probably needed 4 or 5. Its most significant contribution for the foreseeable future is platform fragmentation.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load-link/store-conditional&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tagged pointer example says, in the safety notes:&gt; Pointer Dereferencing: Pointers are only dereferenced after successful CAS operationsI think a rather stronger argument should be needed. But the code doesn’t even follow what the notes say:            let current = self.head.load(Ordering::Acquire);
            if current.ptr.is_null() {
                return None;
            }

            let next = unsafe { (*current.ptr).next };

No CAS.  And this sure looks wrong — the current head could be popped and freed before being dereferenced.edit: put the correct code in.  Thanks, LegionMammal978&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43012000</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I kind of wish there was a shell that had the option for histories localized to a directory. So I can go into a directory and then look at what I was doing when I was last in that directory. Some complicated compilation command line to compile and link a source file and a bunch of libraries that was run when I was last in that directory, for example. There'd still be the 'history' command for everything and then maybe 'dhistory' for the commands that I ran in that specific directory when I was last there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never seen a mid-sized C codebase that annotate "restrict", "nonnull" pointers and "pure", "const" functions so thoroughly, very interesting, would be an important case study if I ever get around to write C optimizer passes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's quite nice. However a few basic functions are missing, like separate history for each instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43052728</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was either here or on slashdot where I've read insightful comment on bloat, can't find it right now so I paraphrase:People often think "speed" when they read "bloat". But bloat often means layers upon layers of indirection. You want to change the color of the button in one dialog. You find the dialog code, change the color and nothing. You dig deeper and find that some modules use different colors for common button, so you find the module setting, change the color and nothing. You dig deeper and find that global themes can change colors. You find the global theme, change the color and nothing. You start searching entire codebase and find that over 17 files change the color of that particular button and one of those files does it in a timer loop because your predecessor couldn't find out why the button color changed 16 times on startup so he just constantly change it to brown once a second. That is bloat.
Trivial change will take you half a day. And PM is breathing on your neck asking why changing button color takes so long.And sure enough, fourth slide mentioned speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main reason for bloat not mentioned in the article is that most developers are not interested in the business domain of the company they are working for. They just want to do stuff with computers and software.Which leads to adding stuff just for the sake of being of interest to developers. 
Think kubernetes, microservices etc. Secondly, because the developers are really not interested in the business (problems), they just want to easiest fix they can get away with. Which leads to bloat, as described.A good test for this are feature specifications: if developers/programmers do not want to write them (or even don't read them with careful attention) then they are not interested in the problem domain of the company. It's an uncomfortable truth.Another thing I've experienced is that non-technical management somehow wants to see solutions with loads of "technologies" included. I was once asked to give a diagram overview of our IT infrastructure. I agreed mentioning it would be a simple diagram (a reverse proxy, a server and a database). The simplicity of the diagram was frowned upon because if you look at all cloud platforms websites they make you believe that the IT infra for all companies must at least look like that of Amazon and Google.So it is also a problem of management that does not want to reward simplicity and is victim of the "cargo cult" so eagerly fed by cloud providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "A lack of vigilance and discipline"Let's say hypothetically that it's a bad strategy to give your employee a C compiler and tell them to write code.  Now, if you instead gave your employee a C compiler and told them to write code with vigilance and discipline, is that somehow now a good strategy?  I don't think "Lack of vigilance and discipline" is a correct or incorrect diagnosis.  I think it's a useless diagnosis.&gt; "It is all but impossible to keep track of what you depend on, and how safe it all is"I think this space is ripe for exploration.  Imagine a world where you could depend on your choice of JSON parser.  One such JSON parser is allowed to perform arbitrary IO, and another is disallowed from doing so - at a language level.  Would you ever pick the first over the second?  Being able to distinguish one from the other would go a long way towards feeling safe about dependencies.  From a safety perspective, it wouldn't even matter how much extra transitive crap the parser pulls in.  If someone hijacks the 'isEven' package, what's the worst that could happen?  Go into an infinite loop or return the wrong value?  Both of these would be immediately flagged by the most casual level of tests, and be far preferable than abitrary code execution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045713</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr is set to join the Fediverse, a decentralized network of interconnected social media platforms, after its migration to WordPress is completed. This move is part of a broader strategy to enhance user experience and integrate more closely with the open web. The transition aims to attract new users while retaining existing ones, allowing for improved content sharing and greater user autonomy. The announcement highlights Tumblr's commitment to embracing a decentralized future alongside its foundational community principles.&lt;/p&gt;

There's just about no chance of them actually making money from it, because its users are just about the most monetization-hostile users on the Internet.It doesn't help that the CEO actively antagonized a large portion of the site not too long ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Matt wasn't so fixated on WPEngine, he could actually do something important and radical by pushing Tumblr as a true user-controlled (i.e. each user has their own TLD) alternative to Twitter, BlueSky, Instagram, Threads, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"After migration completes," but they haven't even started it yet.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MAMBA [1] model gained some traction as a potential successor. It's basically an RNN without the non linearity applied across hidden states, which makes it logarithmic time (instead of linear time) inference with a parallelizable scan [2].It promises much faster inference with much lower compute costs, and I think up to 7B params, performs on par with transformers. I've yet to see a 40B+ model trained.The researches of MAMBA went on to start a company called Cartesia [3], which is MAMBA applied to voice models[1] https://jackcook.com/2024/02/23/mamba.html[2] https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~mmorenom/HPC-Slides/Parallel_prefix_... &lt;- Pulled up a random example from google, but Stanford CS149 has an entire lecture devoted to parallel scan.[3] https://cartesia.ai/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check out "Attention as an RNN" by Feng et al (2024), with Bengio as a co-author. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13956Abstract: The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU
parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference
time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile
and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention
can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to
compute its many-to-one RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular
attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants.
However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated
efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling
this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention’s many-tomany RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the
new attention formulation, we (4) introduce Aaren, an attention-based module that
can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated
efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like
traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance
to Transformers on 38 datasets spread across four popular sequential problem
settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and
time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an internal repo that does guided window attn. I figured out that One Weird Trick to get the model to learn how to focus so that you can move a fixed window around instead of full attn. I also built NNMemory (but that appears to be an idea others hae had now too [1]) and I have a completely bonkers mechanism for non-determanistic exit logic so that the model can spin until it thinks it has a good answer. I also built scale free connections between layers to completely remove residual connections. Plus some crazy things on sacrificial training (adding parameters that are removed after training in order to boost training performance with no prod penalty). There are more crazy things I have built but they aren't out there in the wild, yet. Some of the things I have built are in my repo. [2] I personally think we can get .5b models to outperform 8b+ SOTA models out there today (even the reasoning models coming out now)The basic transformer block has been good at kicking things off, but it is now holding us back. We need to move to recurrent architectures again and switch to fixed guided attn windows + 'think' only layers like NNMemory. Attn is distracting and we know this as humans because we often close our eyes when we think hard about a problem on the page in front of us.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06049[2] https://github.com/jmward01/lmplay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43052427</guid></item><item><title>39.

It should be possible to opt out of being a Facebook user.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how continuous profiling and optimization can significantly enhance throughput in software systems. By implementing continuous profiling, developers can gain real-time insights into application performance, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The piece highlights the importance of ongoing optimization practices that allow teams to improve their code and system architecture incrementally. It emphasizes that by leveraging these techniques, organizations can achieve substantial performance gains, ultimately leading to doubled throughput and better resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t really see what “continuous profiling and optimisation” has to do with your code change here. 68% of your cpu time is spent computing SHA256? That’ll pop out as a hotspot using any competent profiling tool. It doesn’t matter what tool you use, or what approach. It just matters that you look, at all.I’m not saying your special profiling tools are bad. But I can’t tell what’s special about them when they’re simply doing something you could do using literally any profiler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good demonstration that autodetection-based CPU acceleration should be on by default.Also, it looks like several of your projects use zlib. You might take a look at zlib-rs, which is at this point faster than zlib-ng and easier to make use of from Rust. It's available as a flate2 backend. (Note that the folks working on zlib-rs are looking for funding for its development at the moment, if you're interested.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am in the midst of writing a little toy axum project for my pi and also want to measure cpu/mem performance for that. In jvm land I used Prometheus for such tasks. Is there a straight forward tool/crate that anyone can recommend for this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43046122</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live next to Suolijärvi, "bowel lake". I guess the name reflects its shape: https://maps.app.goo.gl/w6wUmBF6m5r6U3eJ9There's also Särkijärvi, "roach lake" (as in the fish) nearby; presumably there is (or once was) a healthy roach population there.The most common lake name in Finland is Pyhäjärvi, literally "holy lake" or "sacred lake", but apparently the original meaning of the word pyhä was something like "demarcated" or "dedicated" (in modern Finnish the verb pyhittää means "to sanctify" but also "to devote" or "to dedicate"). So many of these waterbodies may have been named after ancient border or boundary agreements of some sort, pertaining to fishing or hunting rights for example. Rather mundane stuff despite the word's contemporary meaning!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The color of a lake in satellite view depends on the satellite's viewing angle (which depends on the satellite's trajectory and the lake's location), the angle of the sun (which depends on the same things plus the time and date the image was taken), the weather, the satellite's sensors (false color is a thing), and how the images are processed before publishing. Overall I think it's almost impossible to estimate the "true" color of a lake from public satellite images, even if you used all pixels instead of just one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obviously this is just for fun, but I am a bit disturbed about similar projects that try to gain some meaningful insights out of vast public data sets without the slightest attention paid to the quality of the data used. It doesn’t matter how much processing you do or how clever your algorithms are if the underlaying data is inaccurate, out of date, inconsistent, non-normalized, incomplete, etc. No dataset is perfect, but at least take some time to address it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43007453</guid></item><item><title>43.

Time to seriously consider posibility computers/smartphones are fully mature products like washing machines and refrigerators were 40 years ago and there is no next form factor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Would you prefer to watch your sport of choice in 180-degree immersive video, or as a 2D flatscreen view with a tabletop 3D representation?I think for people who are analyzing the game: Coaches, players, opponents, dedicated fans, historians, the tabletop view will be priceless. I also suspect that the tabletop view will become a tool in the editing room.For casual sports fans, a much more immersive experience will probably be better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43051765</guid></item><item><title>44.

The incident highlights issues surrounding consent, accountability, and the ethical responsibilities of public officials in handling sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prosecutors and police should simply not have qualified immunity. ANY type of immunity is going to be expanded and abused over time. If more police and prosecutors faced real legal jeopardy for violating the rights of people the problem would solve itself. Until then there is really zero consequences for stealing from a person pulled over on the side of the road, withholding evidence, fabricating witnesses, overcharging, or just outright murdering people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is a travesty of justice. But this case also reinforces some lessons I've internalized:1. Never give a law enforcement officer verbal (or certainly written!) consent to search your person or your property. Make them get a warrant. If they threaten something like "We can take you to jail or we can clear this up right here if you give us consent to search" then let them take you to jail.2. Never volunteer information to law enforcement or answer their questions (beyond what's required by law, e.g. identifying yourself in some jurisdictions) unless your lawyer is present.3. Never have marijuana in your car if you're driving across a border from a state where it's legal to a state where it isn't. State troopers sit at those borders and look for any excuse to pull you over because it's an easy win for them.4. Be careful in eastern Oregon because while it's not densely populated, it's still very Red. They have to follow state law w.r.t. marijuana but that doesn't mean they won't try to find creative ways to screw you over. The most surprising thing to me about this case is that most of the malfeasance was on the Oregon side rather than the Idaho side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to see removal of QI from your State's largest violent and corrupt gang, contact your state congress critters.

&lt;p&gt;The article describes how to create a customizable 3D model of a calendar using OpenSCAD, a script-based modeling software. It provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to enable users to modify the calendar's dimensions, font, and other features. The author emphasizes the flexibility of OpenSCAD for generating detailed and personalized designs, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users interested in 3D printing their own calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

https://github.com/elasticdotventures/awesome-openscadPersonally I've stopped using openscad recently (*in the last few years).  I found it's lack of ability to create attachment/mate connectors significantly inhibited it's ability to compose complex objects.   I looked into the amount of effort required to support attachments and ultimately decided that it was the wrong approach and have since migrated to Python &amp; cadquery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice!I'm really happy to see OpenSCAD so often here in HN!Let me also show something that I did: a Braille generator: https://github.com/lucasoshiro/openscad-brailleIt's also available in Thingiverse, so it can generate STL files without having to use OpenSCAD natively: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6463849/remixes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always trying to figure out why OpenSCAD has such a following when, at least to my manufacturer-brain says "whoa it's inconvenient to use to make real stuff" and "there are more expressive 3D modeling DSLs".Is this like hobby only like writing an app in brainfuck? Or am I missing something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43052997</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models specifically in the context of large-scale codebases. It highlights the importance of assessing the effectiveness of RAG in improving code search, generation, and comprehension tasks. The authors outline various metrics and methodologies for evaluating RAG performance, including accuracy, relevance, and efficiency in handling complex queries. Additionally, it explores the challenges faced when implementing RAG in extensive coding environments and suggests best practices for optimizing its integration, ultimately aiming to enhance developer productivity and code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential banning of TikTok in the U.S. amid ongoing security and privacy concerns raised by the app's ties to China. It outlines the possibility of Apple and Google removing TikTok from their app stores if the federal government enforces a ban. The piece highlights the growing tensions between the U.S. and China concerning technology companies and the implications for users and influencers who rely on the platform, as well as the broader impact on the app market and legislative efforts surrounding digital privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;John Gruber from Daring Fireball has an interesting comment:&gt;I’m surprised but not shocked by this. But I’d sure like to see what exactly that letter says. The PAFACA Act — the law that bans TikTok in the US now that the deadline has passed for ByteDance to sell it to a US company — hasn’t changed or been rescinded, and the current delay in enforcement has no basis in law.From this post: https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/apple-google-ti...No basis in law hyperlinks to this post: https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple is breaking the law.  Clearly defined by Congress, and upheld by the Supreme Court.  Just because the president said "Yeah no worries".I feel like this is a huge risk for Apple.  The president can change his mind, you can have a new president, Congress or the supreme court could decide they actually wanted that law enforced.Also, If it comes out that sensitive data was exfiltrated from the US via tiktok, or whatever natsec concern saw it banned realizes, then Apple's position is suddenly even worse because the president can say "Apples clearly breaking the law!  Lets throw the book at them".I don't understand the risk/reward calculations Apple did that came up with this decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s clear by now that the Executive Branch is taking a very selective approach to what laws they will enforce or not. That’s dangerous. Today you might agree with them, tomorrow you might not, but it’ll be too late.The 3 branches balancing each other is the reason why the US has worked relatively well as a democracy for 250 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43044223</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a technical issue related to the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) and addresses a specific patch proposal. The author details the motivation behind the proposed changes, including performance improvements and system stability considerations. The discussion highlights feedback from other developers, explores potential implications of the patch, and emphasizes the importance of thorough testing before implementation. Overall, the piece reflects a collaborative effort within the developer community to enhance the Linux kernel's functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43036904&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being an upstream maintainer is incredibly under-appreciated. It’s an unfathomably hard, and somewhat thankless, job (at least if you do it well). A friend of mine was in a cab with Ted Ts’o at a conference and he was reviewing patches on his phone to keep up with the workload (or maybe he was bored who knows).Despite incredible effort from maintainers, getting necessary changes into Linux can take forever. In the subsystem I depend on (and occasionally contribute to directly) it’s kinda assumed it will take at least a year (probably two) for any substantial project to get merged. This continuously disappoints PMs and Leadership. A lot of people, understandably, chafe against this lack of agility.OTOH, I’ve been on the other side of kernel bugs. Most recently, a memory arithmetic bug was causing corruption, and took my team at least an engineer year to track down. This makes me quite sympathetic to maintainers demands for quality.I’ve also been on the other side of the calibration discussions where Open Source work goes under appreciated. The irony never stops (“They won’t merge our patches!” “Are you having your engineers review theirs?”). That and the raw pipeline issues for maintainers (it takes a lot of experience to be a maintainer, which implies spending a lot of a bright engineer’s time on reviewing and contributing upstream to things unrelated to immediate priorities).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The factors at play are all obvious. The old-school guys want to keep things old-school. The new-school guys want to make things better in a new way. Has there been any new rewrite without a BFDL who himself is of the new school? The vim/neovim schism happened and perhaps that's how it ends. I personally like Neovim and I'm glad to be in backers.md and it's a tremendously larger amount of work than to have just changed vim. But c'est la vie.Egcs vs. gcc was a big deal back in the day and in the end we ended up with gcc by the egcs guys and that was it. When you win, everyone forgets the 'drama' existed. When you lose, everyone remembers you as just the drama guy. RMS had the drama label for decades. Things are not even different. They're the same again. It's like when you'd buy those Chinese NES dupes and they'd have 999 levels of Mario but half the levels would be the same but with different colour bricks. Isomorphic to original but distinct. That's this story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43043312</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Diffusion Without Tears" discusses the concept of diffusion in various scientific contexts, explaining its mechanisms, importance, and applications in fields such as chemistry, biology, and physics. It aims to simplify the understanding of diffusion processes by breaking down complex concepts into easily digestible sections, using visuals and practical examples. The content serves as a resource for students and professionals seeking a clearer grasp of diffusion phenomena and their implications in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not yet clear to me whether this helps anyone understand AI diffusion models, but they seem to enjoy it a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A much simpler exploration of this topic I always liked is the "Linear Diffusion" [0] example which implements a basic Diffusion model using only linear components. Given it's simplicity it gets surprisingly good results at generating digits.0. https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2023/4/21/linear-diffusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43052107</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My Delphi era between 1997-2004 was probably my most productive time. I can't even count the number of apps I wrote with it. The compilation speed, VCL, IDE, compiled code performance, they all contributed to its success I believe. I even wrote three different half-finished Norton Commander clones using Delphi. I also wrote the most popular Turkish social platform with it too.The things that slowed Delphi down was getting distracted by hype: Kylix (Delphi for Linux) and Delphi.NET both contributed to its decline along with the rise of C#. Ironically, I had cheered for both when they came out, but they basically lacked Delphi's magic: fast iteration and native performance. Also, cross-platform dev apparently didn't have big enough market at the time.Basically, Delphi was Golang of early 2000's: self-contained native binaries with native performance in a language high-level enough. Unfortunately, they got lost on the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if it's the rose tinted glasses of looking into the past as I'm getting old but I really feel we missed something along the way on the transition between desktop to web and now mobile.I remember how approachable Delphi and VB6 were for me as a 12-year-old who loved computers, everything was set up so you could just get things done. You didn't have to choose a UI library, a database layer, a build system with transpiling chains, or a particular language stack. You could focus solely on writing the code that solved your specific problem.Now, when I try to teach my child how to code, I struggle to keep him interested because we spend so much time dealing with dependencies problems, boilerplate or having too many choices, none of which have anything to do with the actual goal of what we're trying to do.I don't know, maybe Javascript or Python might take this place one day?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the page is down, behold, the Delphi 1.0 installer screen: https://www.gladir.com/SOFTWARE/DELPHI1/delphi1-install5.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43051598</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "A Decade Later, A Decade Lost," Eric Meyer reflects on the past ten years since the passing of his daughter, discussing the profound impact her loss has had on his life and work. He shares insights into grief, the challenges of moving forward, and how he has navigated both personal and professional changes in the wake of this tragedy. Meyer emphasizes the importance of remembering and honoring those we have lost while acknowledging the ongoing struggle to find meaning and purpose after such a significant loss.&lt;/p&gt;

There was a couple there that had been staring at me. Eventually they came over and apologized. They said I looked like their son and that he'd be about my age that time. I forget how old he was when he passed. But I'll never forget the pain their faces.Some good friends lost their son at 10 months old. He'd be 11 this year. It changed both of them. They've done amazing things since then, but you can see the weight on their faces.I wouldn't wish that pain on anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A long time ago I saw Eric do a presentation at An Event Apart  in Seattle on something like Designing for People in Crisis. He used his trip with his daughter Rebecca to the emergency room as the example of why it's crucial to have a section of your hospital webpage for people in crisis that is very easy to read and very easy to use in case of shock, trauma and emergency. Things like phone numbers and emergency room drop directions/maps.I was familiar with Eric's work at the time, but the vulnerability he showed in using his own tragedy as an example of why websites should be, essentially, accessible for people in various states of trauma and crisis was incredibly moving and made the case for accessible design in a personal, powerful way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Context: This is remembering his daughter, Rebecca.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a breakthrough that allows the 20-year-old PlayStation Portable (PSP) to connect to WPA2 Wi-Fi networks. Originally, the PSP could only connect via the outdated WEP standard, limiting its online capabilities. A new custom firmware update enables users to connect to modern, secure networks, reviving the device's online functionality. This development highlights the continued interest in retro gaming and the efforts of the gaming community to enhance older technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any kind of technical write up of how this was accomplished?  Looking at the Git history of the branch that introduced the plugin[1] was a bit rough, but I did find an interesting commit[2].  That commit looks like it patches some other code (apparently some pspnet_apctl.prx module)[3] but maybe all the discussion was in Discord and it's not been written up elsewhere?It's probably unreasonable to ask for such details without delving into how PSP software images are structured and learning that ecosystem.  Also maybe it's obvious for someone with a more low level understanding of the WPA 1 vs. 2 differences.  But here I am unreasonably curious.  :)[1] https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/commits/rev160/[2] https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/commit/edcc6f01618e3e45...[3] https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/1igh5c9/wpa2_support/m...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely love the PSP - it was such a mind blowing piece of hardware at the time. The portables in my life were an iPod and a Game Boy Advance. Then a buddy of mine showed me the model he had just imported from Japan running Wipeout - it was hard to believe my eyes.It truly felt like the future in a way very few pieces of tech have managed to pull off since. One of Sony’s peak accomplishments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have my own special experience with the PSP, totally unrelated to games. Back in 2009 I was deployed to the middle east. At the time, connectivity was difficult: we used phone cards to call back home. One alternative was that you could use Skype on the PSP, and the cost of a call was very cheap. I remember hanging out in random cafes (probably the Cinnabon outside the Navy base in Bahrain) using their Wi-Fi to call home. Thanks for the reminder of a great memory!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43055671</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who isn't aware of this is either
- Lying. 
- Paid by the oil industry.
- Tricked by the oil industry.All you need is napkin maths. We gain energy by turning carbon into carbon dioxide. Now, we need the same energy to reverse it, but with a loss factor.We continue to see companies and politicians claiming it's feasible and will help us become "green". We should call them out on their shit. If we had the renewable power budget to use proper carbon capture on a large scale, we would already have a fully green grid.---Well... There are other methods than reversing c02 back into carbon chains.Capture of CO2 and storage as CO2, mostly in compressed gas form in underground, has been proposed by a lot of companies. This is a logistical nightmare that has to be kept up for forever. Better keep that pressure chamber leakproof for 1000 years with likely upkeep. (setting aside how inefficiently that actually stores the carbon even if grabbing it from the air was free)Ideas to shove c02 air bubbles in concrete are promising but barely enough to offset the c02 generated from creating the concrete itself.One promising approach is to grow plants and turn them into charcoal. Charcoal is great for keeping fertilizer in the soil so that we can spread it over crop fields for a small increase in yield. Napkin maths on that makes it just require about Australia of farmland (if I remember) to offset the world's CO2 emissions. Almost feasible. (bamboo, algae, and sunflowers seem to be the highest biomass generators, but perhaps a slower crop that can handle worse climate is preferable)But these are still worse plans than just building a green grid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(disclaimer that I manage a climate research group)Jacobson (first author) can be a little touchy about criticism against 100% renewables (litigious), but I think the paper presents a false dichotomy.Regardless of the conclusion, even if all energy infrastructure in the world fully decarbonized today, we are still on a path to high warming (in fact a large chunk of climate change is due to land use change and other factors). The IPCC (and most of the community) is pretty sure large scale carbon capture will be required under any future pathway to avoid catastrophic warming.This is a complex subject, with a lot of competing interests from parties that sometimes partially align with the science and sometimes do not. E.g. O&amp;G companies like to push carbon capture because it plays well and potentially increases their longevity... But that doesn't mean the ideal outcome is to drop carbon capture as part of the toolkit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbon capture is our money being used to pay oil industry. It is for enhanced oil recovery. It is straight up theft with environmental marketing!Twenty-seven DAC plants have been commissioned to date worldwide, capturing almost 0.01 Mt CO2/year. Thats the equivalent of 2000 EVs.---We pay in 8+ different ways for fossil fuels:(1) Subsidies of trillions of dollars per year(2) Ethanol and biodiesel subsidies(3) Pay at the pump (or electricity)(4) Pay for carbon capture to help oil companies extract more oil(5) Pay for the consequences of climate change (a) increase of home insurance (b) bailouts of insurance and utility providers (c) dealing with the direct costs of climate change(6) Health costs! Pollution is directly linked to every disease (except STIs?). Air Pollution Kills 10 Million People a Year. Think of all the cancers, cardiovascular, metabolic, every biological systems.(7) We pay a cost of other pollutants. Lead (thank you oil industry!), mercury (thank you coal industry!). Fish was a source of food, the best kind of renewable food, where you do absolutely nothing other than catch it! This source is now gone, there is so much mercury in fish, that all recommendations of fish are to limit the number of servings!(8) Every person on the planet is paying a fossil fuel tax (the 5 above), to the super super rich. It is a transfer of wealth from everyone to about ~100 people. This money is used to buy all assets (real estate), stocks and everything else, enabling the super wealthy to extract every more wealth from every sector of the economy.---Lets talk about the smallest tax (subsidy!) we pay one of the 6 listed about, ethanol subsidies. 40 million acres are used to grow corn for ethanol subsidies (out of 93m total).If we use these 40m acres for solar, Annual Energy Production (in watt-hours): 52,272 terawatt-hours (TWh)To put that in context: The total electricity consumption of the U.S. is about 4,000 TWh/year. The energy generated from 40 million acres of solar panels could theoretically meet U.S. electricity demand more than 13 times over.But, we'll need a lot less energy when we use solar/wind. We only need a third of the energy we use today, &gt; 65% of the energy is wasted. So, solar panels on the same land used for ethanol production (and subsidized -- which is a lose-lose-lose idea) can produce 39x times US electricity demand (assuming ChatGPT calculation is correct).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43058997</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a fantastic blog post by Ross Rheingans-Yoo about the shortcomings of poker as a tool to teach trading and why Figgie is a better one. https://blog.rossry.net/figgie/He also wrote an equally brilliant eulogy about Max Chiswick, one of his colleagues, who helped him develop it. https://blog.rossry.net/chisness/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've enjoyed playing this.The basic strategy that works for me:1. If I have an obvious skew in the distribution of cards I've been dealt, I can assume the common suit and hence the goal suit and try to buy the cards of that suit.2. If the distribution of cards I have is more or less even, then I just save that round and try to make back the base cost.The hard part has been trying to understand how to update my beliefs based on the trades being made. If you assume everyone is making the rational choice, you might be able to come up with some strategy, but if its against humans who might be trying to bluff, I have no idea. Although, they say its a win-win game, so maybe theres a way there too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of how I got my first job in trading.They had all the candidates going around doing various gimmicks like mental arithmetic. But one of the things we had to do was a trading game where you had to get a set of some commodity by trading your cards with other candidates. So just a screaming pit of kids trying to declare what they wanted to swap for.I got dealt a ridiculously good hand, and all I had to do was wait for a couple of people to give me the missing two or three cards.Once I started, poker was the game the bosses had us play. It seemed like a 10 quid subsidy from the head trader every day, I just had to wait around until he decided he'd played enough and went all in on what was always a crappy hand.That essay about why poker probably isn't the best game for traders is pretty good btw. But there was a golden age of online poker going on at the time, and you could sit there with 5 tables open if you wanted.I like the design of the game, having looked at it superficially. It's basically a market for cards, with what seems like a goal for collecting the right suit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43057344</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I'd really like is a service that edits down YouTube videos by removing all the stock footage and talking head crap, then speeding up the audio to fit over the remaining novel information—whether that's new battlefield footage, electron micrographs, demonstrations of machining techniques, or just elephant toothpaste.  The talking head filler seems like it would be easy to recognize, but stock footage recognition presumably would have a significant false negative rate, which is okay.This would reduce some videos to just a transcription, which would be the ideal outcome, I think.  The less of my limited time on Earth I waste watching some dumbshit reading a script at a camera, the better.  Summarizing the transcript further like this site does might be occasionally useful, of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN! I'm the author of this service. Thank you for your support.There may have been some temporary downtime due to residential proxy running out of bandwidth. I have purchased additional bandwidth. (I run this service for free.)There also may be some errors with particular videos because they are not accessible in certain regions. For now all requests to YouTube originate from United States, but open to change in the future to some kind of round-robin or fallback system.I know it's not perfect. I developed the tool originally for my own use. It's open source and I'm open to any patches or pull requests.Enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What if we summarize all the information in the world into a few hundred volumes of human knowledge, then summarize those into a 10,000 pages book, then that into a 10 long form essays, then those into a 100,000 chars blog post, then that into a pamphlet and finally we summarize one more time into a single tweet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021044</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious about the async aspect of this. I was under the impression PDF processing like OCR is purely CPU bound. OS file I/O interfaces are sync, so async does not help. With GIL, so single threaded Python, I can’t see how async improves performance for the PDF use case. Only parallelism helps, and concurrency doesn’t. When would it yield back to the event loop when it’s busy number crunching?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A really impressive feature list but a pretty heavy system level dependencies. On windows chocolatey is needed for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gotta write something named Wedding, Schoneberg, or Pankow.

That's a name I haven't heard in a long time and at first couldn't place correctly -- for some reason, my mind went to Groklaw, but Lifehacker was the correct answer. Maybe I'm idolizing my own youth and its associated available free time just a tiny bit and I can't actually believe it's been 20 years, but those felt like good times, Web 2.0 with its focus on communication instead of publishing, with Slashdot up top for tech news, Lifehacker, Engadget and many other sites not yet owned by big corporations feeling fresh and bearing individual flair, making you feel being a part of something. A rare feeling in modern times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weeks is the most terrifying unit of time to think in. Short enough so you have a good sense of how long it feels but long enough to add up quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So much of our life is consumed by work. Seeing your lifespan laid bare like this, there's a perverse instinct to optimize what remains. Have to be more productive, more efficient. But it's a bit like seeing you're bleeding out and deciding to optimize your blood donation schedule, isn't it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43061498</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Semgrep, a powerful static analysis tool that allows developers to enforce coding standards and find bugs in their codebase with ease. It highlights the tool's ability to match patterns in code and complies with various programming languages. The author emphasizes the practical benefits of using Semgrep, including enhancing code quality, improving security, and facilitating team collaboration, while also addressing potential challenges in integrating it into existing workflows. Ultimately, the piece encourages developers to adopt Semgrep for more effective code management and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are people collaborating on code when using AI tools to generate patches?We hold code review dear as a tool to make sure more than one set of eyeballs has been over a change before it goes into production, and more than one person has the context behind the code to be able to fix it in future.As model generated code becomes the norm I’m seeing code from junior engineers that they haven’t read and possible nor do they understand.  For example, one Python script calling another using exec instead of importing it as a module, or writing code that is already available as a very common part of the standard library.In such cases, are we asking people to mark their code as auto generated?  Should we review their prompts instead of the code?  Should we require the prompt to code step be deterministic?  Should we see their entire prompt context and not just the prompt they used to build the finished patch?I feel like a lot of the value of code review is to bring junior engineers up to higher levels.  To that extent each review feels like an end of week school test, and I’m getting handed plagiarised AI slop to mark instead of something that maps properly to what the student does or does not know.Pair programming is another great teaching tool.  Soon, it might be the only one left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But I just checked and, unsurprisingly, 4o seems to do reasonably well at generating Semgrep rules? Like: I have no idea if this rule is actually any good. But it looks like a Semgrep rule?I don't know about semgrep syntax, but the chat it generated is bad in at least a couple other ways. E.g. their "how to fix" instruction is wrong:    if let Some(Load::Local(load)) = self.load.read().get(...) {
        // do a bunch of stuff with `load`
    } else {
        drop(self.load.read()); // Explicitly drop before taking write lock
        let mut w = self.load.write();
        self.init_for(&amp;w);
    }

That actually acquires and then drops a second read lock. It doesn't solve the problem that the first read lock is still active and thus the write lock will deadlock.Speaking of which, acquiring two read locks from the same thread can also deadlock, as shown in the "Potential deadlock example" at &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html&gt;. It can happen in the code above (one line before the other deadlock). It can also slip through their rule because they're incorrectly looking for just a write lock in the else block.I've been playing with AI code generation tools like everyone else, and they are okay as autocomplete, but I don't see them as trustworthy. For a while I thought I just wasn't prompting well enough, but when other people show me their AI output, I can see it's wrong, so maybe I'm just looking more closely?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But I just checked and, unsurprisingly, 4o seems to do reasonably well at generating Semgrep rules? Like: I have no idea if this rule is actually any good. But it looks like a Semgrep rule?This is the thing with LLMs. When you’re not an expert, the output always looks incredible.It’s similar to the fluency paradox — if you’re not native in a language, anyone you hear speak it at a higher level than yourself appears to be fluent to you. Even if for example they’re actually just a beginner.The problem with LLMs is that they’re very good at appearing to speak “a language” at a higher level than you, even if they totally aren’t.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43054673</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is kind of hilarious the fraud was uncovered by some esoteric technical investigation when there was definitive evidence in plain sight the whole time."For instance, the "1996–2001" copyright date seen on the title screen in Groobo's video is inconsistent with the v1.00 shown on the initial menu screen, suggesting Groobo's run was spliced together from runs on multiple different versions of the game. Items acquired early in the run also disappear from the inventory later on with no apparent explanation."It reminded me of a joke in Northern Exposure where Ed uncovers a thief by listing circumstantial evidence and then adding one piece of evidence that he almost forgot..  he witnessed the thief stealing a radio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone with absolutely no knowledge of speedrunning community norms, it’s very interesting to see how a practice that is fundamentally about exploiting generally unintended mechanisms within a system design still develops its own notion of ethics, legitimate and illegitimate exploits, etc. Not that different than something like the Astros technology-assisted sign-stealing scandal (as opposed to legitimate sign-stealing) against the Dodgers in the ‘17 WS, at least from the perspective of needing to identify the lines between fair play and illegitimate advantage.Edit: children have helped point out the precise notion of ethics - no exploit is unethical on its face, so long as it is disclosed, which allows the speedrun to be correctly classified and compared to others in its class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of speedrunning, DwangoAC is a name that stands out. He’s represented (possibly led but I’m not familiar) the TAS Block team for Games Done Quick events in the past (not sure about events since 2018 since I did not watch them) and they’ve put together some impressive work.My favorite was publicly declaring that all PS2 replay files for Super Monkey Ball 2 can’t be trusted after a public demonstration as to why. Closely followed by Brain Age shenanigans.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a mathematical problem related to determining the largest sofa that can be maneuvered around a corner in a hallway. It explores the complexities of this problem, detailing research that reveals the maximum size of a sofa that can make the turn. The researchers employed geometric principles and computational techniques to arrive at a solution, contributing to the broader field of mathematical optimization and offering insights into similar spatial challenges in real-world scenarios. The findings highlight the interplay between geometry, theory, and practical application in understanding spatial limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recycled anecdote from an earlier time this was discussed on HN:
While a student, I looked after the apartment of a friend of mine, who was overseas.
When he moved there, we were _just_ able to eke his sofa around the last corner from the stairwell and through the door to his apartment. Just. After much cursing and several failed attempts.
So, what does a good (cough) friend do while the owner is overseas?
Get some hardwood mouldings/trimmings/whatever you call those long, thin pieces of wood typically put where wall transitions to ceiling or floor and nail them to the exterior doorframes, making both door openings perhaps 3/8" or so narrower, paint them in the color of the doorframe, sit back and wait.
Then, years later, as he is about to leave town, moving company comes along and everything runs smoothly until one item remains. The sofa. Obviously, it got in - so it'll (as obviously) come out.
Only it doesn't.
We (everybody except the owner and the moving guys were in on the joke) managed to keep a straight face for several minutes.
The moving guys even laughed as they (eventually) left, mollified by a bottle filled with a Scottish export product which we'd kept on hand to ensure no feelings were hurt afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never knew this was a real thing math people studied! I wonder if Douglas Adams knew about it when he wrote about the sofa stuck in the staircase in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, or if it's a coincidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discussion (131 points, 73 days ago, 36 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42300382&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43049251</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The LLM Debugger VSCode Extension is a development tool designed to enhance the debugging experience for developers working with large language models (LLMs) in Visual Studio Code. It provides features such as interactive debugging, logging, and visualization of model behavior, enabling users to better understand and troubleshoot their LLM applications. The extension supports various programming languages and integrates seamlessly within the VSCode environment, making it a valuable resource for those looking to optimize their LLM workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To people who do this sort of thing:Does generating synthetic data using this make sense for RL of models to be be really good at debugging code? Currently all LLMs inhaled all of code in the world but the data is only text of the code (maybe plus changes that fixed bugs etc) but the amount of insight that can be generated by actually running the code and getting the runtime values, step-by-step is almost infinite.Is this sort of data useful for training LLMs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This would be amazing with Smalltalk/Pharo or a similar language where the concept of debugging is a first class citizen (I guess it's the same for certain Lisp languages?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice UI. We started on a project that does this about 2 years ago. ChatDBG (https://github.com/plasma-umass/ChatDBG), downloaded about 70K times to date. It integrates into debuggers like `lldb`, `gdb`, and `pdb` (the Python debugger). For C/C++, it also leverages a language server, which makes a huge difference. You can also chat with it. We wrote a paper about it, should be published shortly in a major conference near you (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354). One of the coolest things we found is that the LLM can leverage real-world knowledge to diagnose errors; for example, it successfully debugged a problem where the number of bootstrap samples was too low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023698</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmentalism really is just a slippery slope ideology. We have electric cars that don’t pollute and are an amazing experience… but oopsy woopsy they have tires so I guess we need to ban them too. Might as well just keep people burning diesel because the electric cars aren’t ideologically pure enough.How about we just solve the actual problem first? The planet is burning. People used to burn coal indoors for heating, that’s way more fucking harmful than 1 micron of brake dust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having lived next to a semi-main street through a smallish California coastal city without much rain it is pretty eye opening how much black dirt and junk just coat everything next to the road.Walk down the street and touch a bush or any plant leaf and get a nice black hand in the process. The plants are covered, parked cars get covered and the inside of my apartment was covered.It wasn’t until I moved out that I saw the extent of the problem. I only lived there a few years but every surface of my apartment had a coating of the same black dust. I’m now very worried my short time there considerably affected my health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Yale article and the paper both highlight the fact that EVs use regenerative braking and produce less dust.I was worried that this was a rehash of the astroturf campaign from a few years ago focusing on EV weight and how that was so bad for the environment because of tire and road wear. Unfortunately you need to read through the whole thing (instead of the headline and a few paragraphs) to see that information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43058993</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Research highlighted in this article reveals that biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer's disease may appear in the brain up to a decade before clinical symptoms emerge. This discovery suggests the potential for earlier diagnosis and intervention, as the biomarkers can be detected through advanced imaging techniques. The study emphasizes the significance of identifying these early signs in the progression of the disease, which could lead to improved treatment strategies and better management of Alzheimer's before more severe cognitive decline occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jellyfin is a free and open-source media server software that allows users to organize, stream, and share their multimedia collections, such as movies, TV shows, music, and photos, across various devices. Unlike other media server solutions, Jellyfin does not require any subscriptions or licenses, ensuring that users maintain full control over their media and privacy. The platform supports a range of features, including user management, transcoding, and multi-device compatibility. Jellyfin is developed by a community of contributors and is continually updated to enhance functionality and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot's of criticism on here, but I love Jellyfin.I came from Plex a few years ago after their login server had an outage and I was unable to access the media that was on my local computer. Before that I'd been annoyed by them pushing TV shows and since then I've heard about them giving reports on what people have watched. All in all I'm happy.My setup is Jellyfin in a docker container running on a debian machine with an i7-1165G7. It's got a mounted NFS link to my Synology NAS with all the files. The main client I used is Android TV running on an NVIDIA shield.All in all, it's been great. I've got a few nitpicks---loading on ios app isn't as fast as I like if I try to jump to the middle of a movie---but all in all it's great for just watching movies, tv shows, videos, &amp;c. All without any link to the outside world. It's lovely.They also are producing new features at a nice clip and have a strong community. I expect it to keep getting better and better, but honestly even if it never changed I'd happily use it for years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I switched from Plex to Jellyfin/Infuse for three reasons:1) better tone mapping, allowing me to watch HDR movies on SDR without it looking bad.2) Plex, on my variety of clients, had regular issues with audio out of sync. I’m very sensitive to this and it drove me nuts. I have no issues with Jellyfin. I fiddled with all kinds of platform and Plex settings but couldn’t find a solution that solved it for good.3) It’s easier to access Jellyfin over Tailscale. Plex’s normally clever way of exposing itself to the Internet gets in the way. It’s not impossible though.Having said all this, Plex has better client UIs by far. They’re well organized, feature rich, and generally bug free. I still run Plex and plan to at least for the DVR functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ridiculously love Jellyfin. I have found that if my Jellyfin box is IPv6 and I map a domain to that address, such as free DNS from Cloudflare, then I can access my personal media from anywhere on the internet.What I haven’t found is a way to restrict access to known devices, such as MAC address, so that big companies don’t sue me to death. Yes, I know Jellyfin has a login prompt, but I would prefer better security beyond Jellyfin as a just in case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43063167</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines NASA's ten rules for developing software which emphasize best practices to ensure usability and reliability. Key points include the importance of understanding user needs, maintaining clear communication and documentation, prioritizing modular design, and ensuring rigorous testing and validation processes. The rules advocate for user involvement throughout the development cycle and stress the need for adaptability in addressing changes. Overall, these guidelines aim to enhance the effectiveness and safety of software development, particularly in high-stakes environments like aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the original and it explains the purpose of each item:https://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdfThe original clearly describes that the coding rules primarily target C and attempt to optimize the ability to
more thoroughly check the reliability of critical applications written in C. The original author clearly understands what they're doing, and explains lots of other ways to verify C code.For what it's worth, the rationales in the original all make perfect sense to me. Perhaps this is because I learned C on tiny systems? I learned C for hardware for implanted medical devices, and our lab did similar kinds of guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final paragraph is brilliant:    &gt; If the rules seem Draconian at first, bear in mind that they are meant to make it possible to check code where very literally your life may depend on its correctness: code that is used to control the airplane that you fly on, the nuclear power plant a few miles from where you live, or the spacecraft that carries astronauts into orbit. The rules act like the seat-belt in your car: initially they are perhaps a little uncomfortable, but after a while their use becomes second-nature and not using them becomes unimaginable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; People using Ada, Pascal (Delphi), JavaScript, or functional languages should also declare types and functions as locally as possible.My own personal approach in JavaScript is to avoid defining functions in a nested manner unless I explicitly want to capture a value from the enclosing scope.This is probably due to an outdated mental model I had where it was shown in performance profiling that a function would be redefined every time the enclosing function was called. I doubt this is how any reasonable modern JavaScript interpreter works although I haven't kept up. Since the introduction of arrow functions (a long time ago now in relative terms) their prolific use has probably lead to deep optimizations that render this old mental model completely useless.But old habits dies hard I guess and now I keep any named function that does not capture local variables at a file/module scope.A lot of the other notes are interesting and very nit-picky in the "technically correct is the best kind of correct" way that older engineers eat up. I feel the general tone of carefulness that the NASA rules is trying to communicate to be very good and I would support most of them in the context that they are enforced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43061977</guid></item><item><title>18.

I've built a very similar plugin for Obsidian. Recurring checklists are one of the secret weapons in my organisational toolbox.https://github.com/lhansford/obsidian-checklist-reset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was the habits part of org-mode that initially interested me. Being able to schedule a task to repeat every "3 to 7 days" that kept timestamps and was all plain text based? It was the gateway features that got me hooked on Emacs.There was an osx/macOS app that did something similar to the habits in org-mode, but I've forgotten the name of it. Was around from the mid 00s and had a colourful grid showing those times you missed the habit, habits on track, etc. I'm writing this in case anyone remembers it, I hate forgetting stuff!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43014481</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent report by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, which critiques the consulting group McKinsey &amp; Company for its role in shaping opioid policies. It highlights the department's concerns over McKinsey's approach to addressing the opioid crisis, emphasizing that their recommendations may not adequately support those affected by addiction. The report calls for more transparency and accountability in public health strategies and urges a shift towards more effective and community-focused solutions to combat the ongoing opioid epidemic in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hate regulatory capture as much as anyone, but this makes for a more damning-sounding headline than it actually is. To steal a comment from Reddit[1] user NewInThe1AC:&gt; It's a lot less concerning if you actually think about what he specifically did, and what information he would've had access to at the time&gt; He was 23 and working on an early career project. Given how consulting teams are structured, he was not an architect of any grand scheme or plan, and was just executing the work ahead of him. Based on the evidence cited in the article, this was run of the mill business research -- interviewing experts about how pharma sales works and how to segment doctors, summarizing and framing to get to recommendations, and editing PowerPoints&gt; It's only bad when you consider that the product was opioids, but keep in mind that the scientific literature he would've had access to at the time would not have suggested they were especially harmful. If anything, there were compelling reasons for a 3rd party at the time to actually believe that more widespread use of these products would improve wellbeing. If it was so obvious to everyone how bad these things were, we wouldn't have ended up with the crisis we did[1] https://old.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1ipgwcm/sfs_n...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm reading a book on McKinsey now titled "When McKinsey Comes To Town". Given the firms track record finally coming to light it's amazing that working at McKinsey is a career booster instead of a black mark. Hopefully more people start to realize that putting the most ruthless business minds in charge of public healthcare leads to poor outcomes.I'd recommend reading the book, it is a bit of a downer though&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The interesting question is why the mayor is sticking with him. That seems like a major change in the embrace of corruption recently. What does the mayor gain politically by sticking with this guy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43061482</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;Bookshop.org has announced the launch of its new e-reader and e-book app, which aims to support independent bookstores by allowing users to purchase and read e-books directly from local shops. The app offers a user-friendly experience for book lovers, integrating features such as personalized recommendations and the ability to discover and support community bookstores. This move is part of Bookshop.org’s ongoing efforts to provide alternatives to large e-commerce platforms, reinforcing its commitment to promoting independent retail and fostering a vibrant reading culture.&lt;/p&gt;

So here's "Nineteen Eighty Four" https://bookshop.org/p/books/nineteen-eighty-four-george-orw...Yes they should add a filter for DRM-free, or allow setting it as your default.From TheVerge article: *"The app... has a unique social feature: “We’ll allow anybody to share any quote from any ebook to social media, and then people who are on social can click through, buy the ebook, and start reading it on their phone immediately.”"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great news, but the lack of a filter for DRM-free—coupled with the inability to send any other types of titles to an e-reader—makes this pretty useless for a lot of us. An e-ink display really does make all the difference for me to be willing to read e-books.Hopefully they improve the filters with time and it's not an intentional decision to appease publishers.I recently discovered and have been enjoying libro.fm for audio books. Can anyone here recommend a good source of DRM-free e-books?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been waiting for this for so long. I love bookstores and want them to exist but really prefer to read books on an ereader because they don’t take up space and it’s easier for me to read at night. Right now my solution is to buy Kindle books and then make yearly donations to my favorite bookstores (if they accept them) and buy gifts at the bookstore. But that’s not realistic as a plan.This is so close to perfect. Right now to read these I’d need to get an ereader that runs full Android (BOOX, etc) which isn’t what I want. But they say they’re working on a partnership with Kobo, so I’ll wait for that and then finally ditch my Kindle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43056526</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The old Carmack .planWe are not going to do another dos game. No amount of flaming hate mail is going to change my mind on this (PLEASE don't!). The advantages of good TCP/IP support, dynamic linking, powerfull virtual memory, device drivers, etc, are just too much to overcome. Yes, all of those can be provided under dos in various ways, but it just isn't worth it.https://rmitz.org/carmack.on.operating.systems.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's sort of fascinating how much mileage people can squeeze out of MS-DOS.  A part of me always wonders about the "What If" world where GUIs never caught on, and how different the world might be today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given that Quake 2 already runs on Windows 95 back in the days, and how Windows 95 is already somewhat of an "exokernel" to DOS, I wonder how hard it is to port to DOS, actually? Well, given that you can have almost full control to the hardware and framebuffer, and memory allocation and how you can directly issue BIOS calls...I guess the performance should be prettier right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43054963</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find frustrating that this type of product (like the MSX VR some years ago), don't specify clearly what are they selling. Is it an ARM SoC? Does it have a Z80? Is it implemented with a FPGA?Yes, it says "OneChipMSX" https://www.msx.org/wiki/1chipMS but IMHO it could be clearer.If you go to http://www.8086cpu.com/MSX/103.html there's more information, but it definitely puts me off when considering one of these devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this concept looked familiar and indeed it's by the same company which makes those portable 386 and 8086 machines. LGR covered them a while ago: https://youtu.be/6bODiZ5bP84&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My question is: why we have to be stuck in nostalgia?Why isn’t there today a computer with modern processors and GPU which can boot to a REPL, where you can easily interface with all the HW, for example audio and video?I wanted to do something like that for the RP400. But is more difficult that it seems…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43054473</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking Basketball is one of my favorite resources for basketball analysis. He recently made a video debunking myths about the modern game [1]. While yes, there’s far more analytics and knowledge in the game, it hasn’t lead to monotony or poor quality. It’s instead resulted in a Cambrian explosion of tactics, counter tactics, and really diverse team strategies. But the commentary and analysis in mainstream basketball hasn’t caught up, so your average viewer is watching a chess match but not even understanding the basic moves. Which leads to frustration and confusion.[1]: https://youtu.be/fp4but75EjY?si=YdOqZZ5-sH6lQHd9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article presents a readable overview of today’s NBA trends, but IMO is too absolute in its judgment. Basketball is not a solved sport. There is still innovation, for example with OKC’s historically good defense that relies on playing 5 smaller but faster players. There are still good all-around players. There are still people that hit a lot of mid range shots. We have trends going the other way, sure, but they have their own set of tradeoffs and are neither a total solution nor totally embraced in the NBA. Teams will continue to evolve based on the talents of people at their disposal and their own innovative ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reads as someone who looks at data but doesn’t actually play basketball, coach basketball or generally know basketball. Numbers can only tell you so much, and 2025 Celtics and the rise of Steph have led to more 3s but the sport of basketball is not as predictable as the author suggests. For example, look at the college game, which doesn’t reflect this trend as much as the NBA does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43060769</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is planned, and important, and we'll fix it hopefully soon, it's long overdue. I'm sorry this hasn't happened yet, it's always a game of priorities that can never satisfy everybody on time. It however ranks fairly high on my personal list.As one could imagine it's a bit (read: a lot) more complicated than just pausing the AudioContext after some time of silence, but we'll get it fixed regardless, it's possible because others did it. There are tradeoffs we're willing to do.Source: Firefox implementer of a lot of things around this, editor of the Web Audio API standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The websites opening an audio context without using it to play anything are probably doing bot detection.Different browser engines and operating systems implement audio processing differently, so if you play a completely inaudible sound and then record it back (from the API not the microphone) you end up with a signature.You can use that signature to see if the browser is lying about its user agent, running in headless mode, or all sort of other interesting edge cases that are not a real user buying widgets.https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/3201a7d6...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the output idles, digital SPDIF signals lose sync. Re-syncing once playback starts is not instant, and you lose the first second of audio or so. I wrote a program that kept open an output withought dumping any data to the line, just to prevent the output from idling.Doesnt make much sense in the context of a laptop though, so energy savings make sense there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43062546</guid></item><item><title>29.

And none of the other hashes invented since then have been mentioned.Was this article actually written years and years ago and just republished with a new date?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very confused by the article. It's missing about two decades of modern non-cryptographic general hash development, it completely fails to mention the field of universal hashing which created formal criteria for collision probability and produced provably correct constructs to achieve those criteria...As a self-plug for a related topic, I think going forward we should also take into account HashDoS for non-cryptographic hash functions. All of the hashes mentioned in the article are vulnerable to this, see https://orlp.net/blog/breaking-hash-functions/ for some techniques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems weird not to mention the SMhasher test suite and the dozens of fast and high-quality hash functions that were created in recent years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43031228</guid></item><item><title>30.

Availability of network diagnostics tools in Windows has been problematic, particularly for very infrequent use.  There are some good looking ones for purchase, but it's hard to purchase when we don't usually need it.For a while, largely related I think to just not having enough bandwidth at our office, but also partly because our coax on the Xfinity cablemodem was sketchy, we were not infrequently having issues, and the majority of my coworkers are on Windows.  ping and tracert aren't very good tools for finding out what is going on with intermitant networking issues, especially when it might also be people's home wifi from WFH.  There were times I just wished they could run mtr.Over the last year or so I've been seeing more Windows tools available, which has been great!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I like doing is using ttyplot and then it supports many commands and you can even specify an extraction param to plot on so then it's very Unix philosophy.https://github.com/tenox7/ttyplot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023991</guid></item><item><title>31.

Even epyc's with lots of channels go down to 2-4 t/s after ~4096 context length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's not a bad result, although for £320 for 4x Pi5s you could probably find a used 12GB 3080 and probably more than 10x token speed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43059579</guid></item><item><title>32.

It's a bright future, with cheap, clean renewable power, if we are willing to let the market choose it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In the spring of 2024, Texas’ installation of utility scale solar outpaced California’s, and jumped from 1,900 megawatts in 2019 to over 20,000 megawatts in 2024. As a result, solar met nearly 50 percent of the state’s peak power demand on some days.That’s impressive. And fairly green-friendly for a state that gets a bad rap for being in bed with oil/gas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its an amazing phenomenon in Texas. I've seen a bunch of these wind and solar installations as I've driven through the state.One technical issue with the article, and I see this a lot, is the unit of measure used to describe the storage capacity.&gt; Texas added nearly 1,500 megawatts of battery storageIn the addled, quasi-imperial units of the US, shouldn't this be megawatt*hours?I once asked an english person about BTUs, they had no idea what I was talking about. Even though that is an allegedly British Thermal Unit.Of course, in rational units this would be something like gigajoules:1.0 Megawatt-hours (MWh) = 3.60 Gigajoules (GJ)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43059826</guid></item><item><title>34.

I'm glad it can be done, though I've certainly not been motivated enough to try.  I just keep a different machine around for anything gaming-ish, and don't worry about it.That said, if you have skipped out on trying Qubes because you think you lack sufficient hardware, my Qubes daily driver (and primary computer for personal use) is a 2015-era Lenovo X250, with a 2C/4T I7-5600U, 16GB RAM, and a SATA SSD.  It's limited in some ways, I can feel when I'm trying to do too much on it, but it is quite useful, and has been for some while.  The memory balancing between AppVMs works nicely, and you can safely reduce memory allocation for a lot of VMs.  A lot of my running Debian12 VMs are between 1GB and 2GB practical allocation, and work just fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also worth mentioning Looking Glass which does a similar trick.https://looking-glass.io/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be curios to try vGpu with Qubes. It's definitely a security issue and has been left behind on newer NV consumer hardware but would be neat for low-risk qubes. I do have to admit that the performance is still great w/o hardware acceleration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43063239</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "knowledge problems" and explores whether they truly exist in the context of decision-making and information access. It argues that while traditional theories often cite knowledge as a barrier to effective decision-making, the real issue may stem from deeper systemic factors, such as incentives and structural constraints. The author highlights the importance of understanding these underlying issues to address challenges more effectively, encouraging readers to reconsider assumptions about knowledge and its role in societal problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  the color coding program was completely misguided because it assumed that we didn’t know what healthy food was. I challenged the nutritionist to an experiment: Make two plates of food, go into the restaurant at lunch time, and ask people to point out the healthier plate. My bet was that if you did not purposefully make it very tricky, people would unfailingly point to the right plate.I wholeheartedly disagree.I used to struggled with weight most of my young years. No matter what I did I achieved incremental advances at best. At some point I decided to start "counting calories", something that I used to frown upon.To my shock some foods that I ate that I considered "healthy" weren't so much so. This isn't even counting the fact that most experts can't even agree what is healthy or not, and opinions change over time.Just like with coding, there are some black/white examples where the average person could make an easy distinction, but then there is a wide range of greys in the middle where people might not really know what's "good/bad".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP indeed misunderstood the color coding program by treating it as a knowledge problem. Looks to me like it was much more about "nudging": It's one thing to decide for yourself, in your head, whether to have the tofu bowl or the fries for lunch.

When every editor can have maximum magic with the same model and LSP, why not use the tool that lets you also review AI generated diffs and navigate at lightning speed. Vim is a tool that can actually keep up with how fast AI can accelerate the dev cycle.Also love to see these local solutions. Coding shouldn't just be for the rich who can afford to pay for cloud solutions. We need open, local models and plugins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does it need an Apple M-series chip? Any hope for it getting on an intel chip and using it with Linux?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a good method for sandboxing models? I would like to trust these projects, but downloading hard-to-analyze arbitrary code and running it seems problematic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43054244</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a common misunderstanding surrounding Test-Driven Development (TDD), particularly the belief that TDD is solely about writing tests first. It highlights that TDD is not just a testing technique but also a design technique, emphasizing the importance of understanding the system's requirements before writing tests. The author argues that the primary goal of TDD is to facilitate clearer design and better software quality, rather than merely achieving test coverage. By correcting these misconceptions, the article encourages developers to embrace TDD as a holistic approach to software development that improves both design and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first job interview after college. It was a pair programming session but I would not touch the keyboard. I would dictate and the interviewer would type. I had to implement a dynamic array in java using TDD in one hour. From time to time I would break protocol and jump into implementation before the tests. Overall it went good. I finish the job. The interviewer however assesed that he was afraid I would not actually use TDD on the job, he was spot on. I did not get the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple rule of thumb.Always write functional tests first. Doesn't matter if they are slow - you still want something that faithfully captures the specified behavior and allows you to detect regressions automatically.Then, if your resulting test suite is too slow, add finer-grained tests in areas where the perf benefits of doing so dwarf the cost of necessary black-boxing.Getting down to the level of individual classes, never mind functions - i.e. the traditional "unit tests" - should be fairly rare in non-library code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree w/the author that the concept of "unit" often hurts test quality.You should be striving to balance the long-term usefulness of your tests with the debuggability of those tests.  In my experience, those tests are what most people would call "integration tests" (although that name, like so much terminology in the testing world, is confusing and poorly defined.)You want to get the tests up at as high a level of abstraction as possible where the API and correctness assertions are likely to survive implementation detail changes (unlike many unit tests) while at the same time avoiding the opaque and difficult to debug errors that come with end-to-end testing (again, the language here is confusing, I assume you know what I mean.)See https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43060636</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm working on a similar service but built on top of ActivityPub and from experience I can say that consuming the firehose in real time with your app (I'm referring to the "random discussions" section) is going to be slow as hell.I recently moved into a direction where the relevant streams of content (let's call them subreddits) get built in the background and persisted locally so when users interact with the website don't need to wait for the whole thing to be built synchronously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting idea, but I'm not sure it's gonna work in the long run. There is a key difference between reddit / forums and bsky / other apps like it. Forums are many to many, and the focus is around community. Someone (doesn't really matter who) posts something, and lots of people comment. You go there to read the voices of many people. Bsky / birdapp on the other hand focus on one to many. The person posting matters the most, and the commenters are usually "followers" or people interested in what one person has to say.It's a key difference IMO, and the main reason I like forums and heavily dislike the twitter-style apps. I want to read the voices of many, not the voices of few "influencers". You can make it look like a forum, but it's still gonna be focused on the voices of few.That being said, with reddit going crazy over the last few years (and especially this last election cycle), I'm open to suggestions on new places to try that focus on forum-style discussions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's an opportunity for an "architecture inspired by bluesky" reddit alternative. The reddit CEO recently said they intend to start charging for premium features, which may drive a large number of people away from the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43058285</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article encourages readers to engage with artificial intelligence (AI) by asking it questions related to topics they are knowledgeable about. The author emphasizes that this exercise can reveal the strengths and limitations of AI in understanding and generating information. By testing AI's responses against one's own expertise, individuals can gain insights into the technology's capabilities, biases, and potential for error, ultimately fostering a more informed perspective on AI's role in society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intelligence and knowledge are distinct concepts. Asking about it's knowledge teaches noting about it's intelligence. 
Intelligence is the ability to learn, reason, and solve problems. Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and skills.Chatbot LLM's don't have metacognition. They don't know that they don't know.  If you peek inside the LLM, the process seems different for things they don't know. They just can't express it because they are trained to produce good probability outcome instead of accurate one.They have potential as knowledge databases, but someone must figure out how to get "I don't know" information out of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I am just way deeper in this space that any well-adjusted person should be, but the line of 'did you know LLMs are bad with niche factual information tasks in non-verifiable domains?' has become extremely boring to me. It feels very hard to find something actually new to say on the topic. I find it amazing people still feel the need to talk about it. But then again, I guess most people don't know the difference between a 4o and an R1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have finally found the value of llms in my daily work.I never ask them anything that requires rigorous research and deep knowledge of subject matter.But stuff like “create a script in python to do X and Y” or “how to do XY in bash” combined with “make it better” produces really good and working in 95% of the time results and saves my time a lot! No more googling for adhoc scripting. It is like having a junior dev by your side 24/7. Eager to pick up any task you throw at them, stupid and overconfident. Never self-reviewing himself. But “make it better” actually makes things better at least once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43056831</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sharp rise in the rat population in my city coincides with a new regulation requiring food waste to be placed in a thin, dedicated bag outside. Since collection is delayed, the waste spoils, providing an easy food source for pests. It did not coincide with climate warming, at least not in my city.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The most promising integrated pest management (IPM) strategies focus on making the urban environment less conducive for rats rather than outright removal of rats already thereI live in the suburbs and in the last few years have seen an exploding rat population outdoors on my property. It began when my neighbors got chickens back in 2020; when home-steading and DIY food management began taking off. They ended up eventually removing the chickens and scraps, but the rats stayed and their population keeps growing despite the removal of food.I've trapped and killed SO many of these pests, but they keep increasing and each generation seems to be smarter about traps than the previous. The traps have become ineffective at this point. I've tried many of the suggestions seen on Youtube and they fail or some of them are just downright messy/impractical (the bucket).The most effective solution I came up with so far is building a custom wooden box that leaves just a small opening (like a tunnel) for the rat's head to get into to reach the bait. I used peanut butter as bait and a snap trap inside the box. I then cover the wooden box with leaves and stuff. This worked for a few months, but unfortunately it's not working any longer. On the last occasion it worked, the rat in the trap got cannibalized by another larger rat. Since then, I can see on my camera that the rats approach the trap, but they never enter. I've tried relocating it and everything, no luck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;living in an old farm house, where rodents can be a problem, with feed and manure and old buildings providing , food and shelter for rats and mice, this year is exceptionaly cold,and now everything is frozen solid, so rodents can dig and tunnel, and all the water is frozen, so the rodents are having a hard time, invading looking for food and water and warmth, and I am doing my best to be inhospitable, rat, bat, splat.
 Also the preditors are finding it easier to get them as rodents are forced to expose themselves, I even had a close encounter with an ermine, which is one tiny sleek, fancy killing machine, huge eyes for the size of the head.
 Rats can not survive outside of areas without human development in areas with hard winter freezes, and face heavy predation by snakes further south, so are again limited to human and snake(other preditor) free areas, like islands.
 Also rats are essentialy imune to poisons that were deadly to them, and are likely becoming imune to whatever is thrown at them now.
 So numbers will be up, and the reasons for that will vary.
 I dont like rats at all, and study them, as I hunt them, and other vermin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43058886</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs on the European Union and the potential effects of the EU's Value-Added Tax (VAT) on U.S. goods. It argues that both the tariffs and VAT are discriminatory trade practices that could escalate tensions between the U.S. and the EU. The author emphasizes that such measures could lead to a trade war, adversely affecting businesses and consumers in both regions by increasing costs and limiting market access. Overall, the piece highlights the need for careful consideration of trade policies to avoid detrimental economic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Note that, while a VAT is imposed at every stage of the process, the net effect is to apply the rate one time to the final sales price. The tax is collected in increments (on the “value added” at each stage), but unlike with a pyramiding sales tax, it does not double tax inputs. The VAT and ideal sales tax share an identical tax base and, if imposed at the same rates, yield identical collections.The VAT is important in Europe, because if a product is manufactured in many countries, each of those countries gets a share of the tax revenue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's important to understand that (in simple terms) businesses do not actually pay VAT. VAT is a tax that ultimately burdens consumers, not companies. When a business purchases a product that includes VAT, it initially pays the VAT amount. However, when the same business later issues invoices for its own products or services (also including VAT), it is required to remit the VAT to the tax authorities minus the VAT it has already paid on its own purchases.In practice, this means that if you sell something with VAT to a company, the VAT component is irrelevant to that company. This is, of course, a simplified explanation, but fundamentally, that's how the system works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comparing VAT to an Import Tax is unbelievably stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43062457</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a research survey conducted by Microsoft that explores the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and critical thinking. It highlights trends and perceptions regarding AI's impact on critical thinking skills in various contexts. The survey aims to gather insights on how AI is perceived to influence decision-making, problem-solving, and educational outcomes, and to identify areas where further investigation is needed. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of understanding AI's role in shaping critical thinking abilities among individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this study does not say what most people are taking it to say.&gt; our research questions - when and how knowledge workers perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using GenAI (RQ1), and when and why do knowledge workers perceive increased/decreased effort for critical thinking due to GenAI (RQ2)This is about the application of critical thinking to AI outputs and in AI workflows. Are people cognitively lazy when some other entity hands them plausible sounding answers?The answer of course is yes. If some entity gives you a good enough result, probably you aren’t going to spend much time improving it unless there is a good reason to do so. Likewise you probably aren’t going to spend a lot of time researching something that AI tells you if it sounds plausible. This is certainly a weakness, but it’s a general weakness in human cognition, and has little to do with AI in and of itself.In my reading, what this study does not say, and does not set out to answer, is whether or not the use of AI makes people generally less able or likely to engage in critical thinking as a result of use of AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study (PDF): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2025/0...I did not link to it directly because the  PDFs title - "The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking: Self-Reported
Reductions in Cognitive Effort and Confidence Effects From a
Survey of Knowledge Workers" - was way too long for the HN title length limit.Abstract (from the PDF):&gt; The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in knowledge workflows raises questions about its impact on critical thinking skills and practices.&gt; We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using GenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so. Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in work tasks.&gt; Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in GenAI are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in GenAI-assisted tasks.&gt; Specifically, higher confidence in GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, GenAI shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship. Our insights reveal new design challenges and opportunities for developing GenAI tools for knowledge work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a study comes out which demonstrates to high confidence that some extremely horrible outcome is certain with this technology, would any changes be made? Would we tell OpenAI to close shop? I don't think, with the way our society and politics is set up, we would be able to deal with this. There's too much money, ego, and general inertia at play to change course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43057907</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The website is dedicated to "Darcs," a distributed version control system that allows for efficient management of projects and code collaboration. It provides comprehensive information on its features, usage, and installation, along with guides and tutorials for both beginners and experienced users. The site emphasizes Darcs' unique properties, such as its ability to handle patches and changes intuitively, and highlights community contributions and resources, making it a valuable reference for developers interested in version control solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Darcs to me is a bit like VHS vs betamax. A superior technology that did not win in the market due to other factors.Way back in the day we did some due diligence on our source control - at that time CVS - and settled on darcs as the most elegant.Around the same time Linus created git and the rest is history and eventually darcs went the way of betamax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For now: Give Jujutsu (https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) a try, it's good whilst maintaining a level of compatibility with git which is good for gradual adoption and uptake.Avoid: Pijul. I doubt it will succeed in getting wide adoption. Some of the reasons already covered by others comments in this thread so don't want to repeat.Wish: I really wish darcs was rebooted and made a comeback. What can we do to make it happen? I heard a version 3 is a work in progress. I am also aware of this new initiative (GitHub equivalent but for darcs): https://smeder.ee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used and rather liked Darcs in the dark ages when SVN was the best alternative.  Then I discovered that it would happily accept largish binary files, but would later refuse to give them back when I needed them.  I could have lived with an error on check in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43022059</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the decision to sunset Create React App (CRA), a widely used tool for creating React applications. Due to the evolving needs of developers and the rise of new tools and frameworks that offer more flexibility and capabilities, the React team will no longer actively maintain CRA. Instead, they encourage the community to explore other tools that align better with modern development practices. The article highlights the importance of migration resources and suggests alternative approaches for developers currently using CRA.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vite is a direct replacement for CRA but corporate speak makes it sound you need a framework and that corporate speak is funded/influenced by Vercel.No you do not need NextJS or any other server side JS for most of the projects. Let's not pretend SPA is dead. Most of you do not need server side rendering and all the complexity it brings.Just use Vite. You can decide whether to add Tailwind etc later. React should be left bare bones, and it can recommend frameworks, not make them sound default.    npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pleased to say I had a meaningful hand in this :)  As some background, this finally happened because:- React 19 broke CRA- I griped about it loudly on Bluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/acemarke.dev/post/3lggg6pk7g22o) and that started a long debate- I filed an umbrella issue describing the specific breakage and recommending an actual official deprecation announcement (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/17004)- The React team finally took action to fix the CRA breakage, then wrote the blog post, updated the setup docs page, and redid the docs SEO to get Google to stop showing the legacy docs as a search result.So, kudos to the React team for making meaningful changes here!(It's not _exactly_ what I was hoping for, and I gave them some additional review feedback that they didn't include, but gotta give credit for the actual changes and steps forward!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article kindly phrases the alternative as “use a framework” and links to a page that has only one actual framework: NextJS.I don’t support React pushing a wholesale shift to NextJS as a starting point for every project, given it’s mostly directed by a single private company (Vercel) that have positioned themselves as the default deployment platform for NextJS apps, publish the documentation, and do not shy away from claiming it as their own.It has become extremely difficult to distinguish between NextJS features that are community-driven vs profit-driven e.g. api route functions (putting your backend in your React project, so now you will pay them for compute) and NextJS image optimization (famously expensive, and NextJS literally throws warnings if you don’t use it).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43051961</guid></item><item><title>1. “A calculator app?

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of a simple calculator app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It explains the app's features, including basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and offers a user-friendly interface. The implementation details are shared, including the code structure and functionality, allowing readers to understand how to build a similar application. The article encourages learning coding through practical projects, illustrating the concept of programming in a straightforward manner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice story. An even more powerful way to express numbers is as a continued fraction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction). You can express both real and rational numbers efficiently using a continued fraction representation.As a fun fact, I have a not-that-old math textbook (from a famous number theorist) that says that it is most likely that algorithms for adding/multiplying continued fractions do not exist. Then in 1972 Bill Gosper came along and proved that (in his own words) "Continued fractions are not only perfectly amenable to arithmetic, they are amenable to perfect arithmetic.", see https://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt.I have been working on a Python library called reals (https://github.com/rubenvannieuwpoort/reals). The idea is that you should be able to use it as a drop-in replacement for the Decimal or Fraction type, and it should "just work" (it's very much a work-in-progress, though). It works by using the techniques described by Bill Gosper to manipulate continued fractions. I ran into the problems described on this page, and a lot more. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unrelated to the article, but this reminds me of being an intrepid but naive 12-year-old trying to learn programming. I had already taught myself a bit using books, including following a tutorial to make a simple calculator complete with a GUI in C++. However I wasn't sure how to improve further without help, so my mom found me an IT school.The sales lady gave us a hard sell on their "complete package" which had basic C programming but also included a bunch of unnecessary topics like Microsoft Excel, etc. When I tried to ask if I could skip all that and just skip to more advanced programming topics, she was adamant that this wasn't an option; she downplayed my achievements trying to say I basically knew nothing and needed to start from the beginning.Most of all, I recall her saying something like "So what, you made a calculator? That's so simple, anybody could make that!"However in the end I was naive, she was good at sales, and I was desperate for knowledge, so we signed up. However sure enough the curriculum was mostly focused on learning basic Microsoft Office products, and the programming sections barely scraped the surface of computer science; in retrospect, I doubt there was anybody there qualified to teach it at all. The only real lesson I learned was not to trust salespeople.Thank god it's a lot easier for kids to just teach themselves programming these days online.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The link at the end is both shortened (for tracking purposes?) and unclickable… so that’s unfortunate. Here is the real link to the paper, in a clickable format: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3385412.3386037&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43066953</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a collection of design documents related to the creation and development of "The Sims," a popular life simulation video game. It showcases the conceptual and technical aspects that went into the game's design, including character creation, gameplay mechanics, and the overall vision for the game's universe. The documents provide valuable insights into the creative process behind "The Sims," illustrating how the developers approached various elements to enhance player experience and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sims will forever be one of those magic games to me; one that inspired me to learn MAX to get my own items into the game, non-perspective rendering, sprites, z-buffer, iirc. I still play and work in 3D to this day, game modding has taught me the best way to interact with a computer... create vs. consume!It has this quality that I'd describe as toy-like, you can pick it up in so many different ways and let your imagination fill in the experience.Personally I'd spend weeks just building, paused, filling up my account §§§ as I need, ignoring my sims at the curb. Other times I'd give it an honest play-through roleplaying as myself in a different world. Eventually I'd be mean and lock my Sims in a-  (maybe I'll not document my war-crimes today.)I'd reinstall and build up a fancy house, but I fear it'd grab me like a Factorio drip and I'd disappear into the Sims for a month. I think I'll give this a read instead, I haven't done the design-document thing since I studied Game Design in college many moons ago.Thanks so much for posting all the tidbits and insight into another true gem of a game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, it’s Charles!

&lt;p&gt;Gixy is an open-source tool designed to help users analyze and secure their Nginx configurations. It identifies potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, providing recommendations for improvements. Gixy supports various configuration formats and is useful for both beginners and experienced users in maintaining secure web servers. The tool aims to enhance the security posture of Nginx deployments by automating the review process and ensuring best practices are followed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the nginx module on NixOS[1] and enabling services.nginx.validateConfigFil, which defaults to true, generated nginx configurations will be checked by Gixy[2].
The build will actually fail if Gixy finds any issues.[1]: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-24.11/nixos/modu...
[2]: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-24.11/pkgs/build...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work, tons of extra stuff vs the original.Had a thought: imagine if it were a subcommand of nginx (whichever fork will accept it) - that’d give it a much wider audience.Even more impactful would be if analysis always ran at nginx startup. Wouldn’t have to be blocking but getting warned about risks would help more folks configure things more correctly more often.Either way great to have tools to help with correctly configuring the parts of your infra that are exposed to the wild internet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been building a platform [1] which makes it easy to deploy internal tools. Instead of taking the config file approach, it allows you to install each app at a unique location (domain name + url path). Within its location, the app owns all the URLs and can managing request routing without requiring a global config update.The advantage is that new app installations cannot interfere with an existing app. I wrote more about this approach at https://clace.io/blog/webserver/[1] https://github.com/claceio/clace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43065217</guid></item><item><title>4.

Perplexity just kind of rambles generally about the topic.There are other examples I can give of similar failures.Seems like generally it's good at summarizing a single question (Who are the current Fortune 100 CEOs) but as soon as you need to then look up a second list of data and marry the results it kind of falls apart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In about 2 weeks since OpenAI launched their $200/mo version of Deep Research, it has already been open sourced within 24 hours (Hugging Face) and now being offered for free by Perplexity.

&lt;p&gt;The document outlines the development and functionality of a low-cost, portable flea microscope designed for examining fleas and other small insects. It describes the construction process, including components and materials used, and provides detailed instructions for assembly and operation. The aim is to make entomological research more accessible by enabling users to easily observe and analyze specimens in a variety of settings. Emphasis is placed on the educational and practical applications of the flea scope for both hobbyists and researchers studying tiny organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the price this small thing is really awesome.I think the posted title need to be improved and updated to include function or waveform generator instead of just More.Perhaps because of that most of the comments here just focusing in the oscilloscope part.As any who has dabbled with electronics know your typical workbench is normally consist of oscilloscope, logic analyzer, waveform generator, digital multi-meter and power supply normally 12V DC.It seems to me this little $18 hybrid signals scope/generator can do almost all of these functions, and since they are integrated on the same device you don't need to synchronize them which is a big plus.For old school HP/Agilent/Keysight electronics workbench discrete solutions can easily cost tens of thousands dollars, no kidding.The modern version of this is the Digilent Discovery Pro 3000/4000/5000 series with price tags of several thousands dollars. They are described as the All-In-One High-Speed Mixed Signal Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Power Supply, and DMM. The cheaper version of this Digilent Discovery 1/2/3 series that cost around $400. But the latter is quite bandwidth and resources limited thus more comparable with the Flea-Scope [1].[1] Digilent Analog Discovery 3 vs. Digilent Pro ADP2230 [video]:https://youtu.be/yr9SGxiBAnI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi all, new here.One post below might be a bit misleading -- it's just 18 Msps, not 100 -- so think of it as good for signals up to 1 MHz or so with decent fidelity...  And it uses a PIC32, not STM32.  It is 12 bit ADC, but the noise floor makes it more like 10 or 11.  A cool thing is it also does digital capture and waveform generation at the same time, but clearly it's all pretty simple...My goal was to be able to get these in a classroom at every seat, where there's already a computer or tablet or chromebook, and have it "just work"...    The thing I like the best by far, though, is javascript access -- you only need a webpage for the GUI -- no software install or app store or anything!To go deeper for the classroom experiments, you can use a different "deep dive" webpage with a command-line UI and log in interactively and take control of all the pins programmatically in BASIC, and even configure the board to autorun a BASIC program on power-up...  You can make a "simon" game with 4 switches, 4 LEDs, a buzzer, and about 100 lines of code...  Or with a thermocouple and an op-amp and a solid-state relay, you can make a cool toaster oven temperature controller for reflow soldering -- which is how I built all the prototypes...  The nice thing is the javascript access on the host comes for free still, and so BASIC can talk directly to the host computer (e.g., running python or powershell)!  Examples are here: https://rtestardi.github.io/pages/I have also had fun with automotive applications for Flea-Scope -- it is so easy to just bring out a phone or tablet and measure a crankshaft sensor -- and without it you're just guessing and replacing components from some diagnostics flowchart...As for licensing, it is all open source, and anyone can rebuild it (and even sell it).  There is a patent on the internal BASIC, but there is also a perpetual license to the software builds I have made and tested and released -- conceivably you could build the scope without BASIC at all -- it is unneeded except when you use the board in "deep dive" mode for BASIC programming.If there is interest, I have toyed with the idea of making a Mosquito-Scope, with 2 channels and selectable input amplification (for sub-millivolt signals) based on the still-brand-new dsPIC33A, which is actually cheaper and faster than the PIC32MK.-- Rich&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For about the same price ($13), I'm happy with this logic analyzer I bought through amazon[1] a month ago.  I spent more on probes[2] ($24) than I did the analyzer. ;-)To power it, I'm using SigRock/Pulseview[3], which sees it as a compatible clone. It's wild to be able to see signals a few tens of nanoseconds wide so cheaply.[1] https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077LSG5P2[2] https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLB63GL3[3] https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43068585</guid></item><item><title>7.

Do we also have some studies on how to avoid gathering people in such z dense level that all possibilities of that kind of dramatic outcome can occurs.Also note that not all crowds are the same. I went to some metal concerts where the moves would exhibits very different moves, including less packed and steal, split in in very highly packed borders before an abrupt run and merge, as well as creating protection circle around someone who falls on the ground. I actually didn't witnessed any major crowd incident in such a concert, so I would be interested to have statistics about outcomes of a crowd panic in a metal concert vs in a cinema for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That video is really illuminating in the article. I've experienced it once at the entrance of a concert. If you have all kinds of forces acting on you, then you don't have much autonomy on how you move.Would this to some extent be how actual fluid (e.g. water) move as well? I thought atoms just freely flowed around in there from one side of the liquid to the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43026001</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;Viktor Antonov, the renowned art director known for his influential work on iconic video games such as Half-Life 2 and Dishonored, has passed away at the age of 52. Antonov was celebrated for his unique artistic style and contributions that shaped the visual landscapes of these games, leaving a lasting legacy in the gaming industry. The article highlights his impact on game design and the mourning of his loss within the creative community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bleakness of both Half Life 2 and Dishonored's really resonated with me. I can't overstate how much I appreciated both of these games, and in no small part thanks to the art direction.This is really sad news, but it's amazing how much of a profound impact he left on so many players, and without a doubt on so many past, current, and future artists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Half-life 2 is imo still the most important and impactful game of our generation — from gameplay to art-style to game mechanics and so on, it’s still exceptional and I struggle to come up with another single player game that blew me away like HL2 - Dead Space comes close but it was less revolutionary imo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rest in peace. His work was monumental.Level design is something that is often there as a way to simply service the gameplay. You make sections that enable to game loop. Half Life 1 is designed this way: set pieces for aliens and marines to have interesting encounters.Viktor designed levels that felt part of worlds that are lived in. City 17, where Half Life 2 takes place, feels like a believable dystopia. With evil guards and propaganda and a looming techno tower of Sauron.Dishonored pushed this even further, with levels that not only are equally well presented, but can be traversed in so many creative ways. It’s a sandbox for the mind.Rip, your work was brilliant and inspiring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43069514</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried the Audacity noise-removal plugin recently and it's complete crap. I fed a high-quality audio stream from a Rode mic into a few different options to see which could remove the noise of my server rack. iMovie made the voice sound like a robot and Audacity barely did anything. The only thing that worked was DeepFilterNet and it's free, open-source and cargo installable.There's no reason to lock yourself into an intel-only solution. Just use DeepFilterNet. The results of this on my noisy server room were insanely good. Almost no voice dropout with 100% fan noise removal.https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNetEDIT: Even more interesting, it looks like OpenVino is just DeepFilterNet glued to Whisper.cpp and tied to Intel hardware.https://github.com/intel/openvino-plugins-ai-audacity/tree/m...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This only works with Intel GPUs, and CPUs and NPUs. No Nvidia support for instance.https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/about-openvino/release-notes-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a tool that can remove very noisy audio recording of a song using actual song as a reference?I found a very old audio cassette from my childhood with me and some other kids talking while a song is playing in background. I tried subtracting the song using Audacity but for that to work reference song and recording must align "perfectly" which is very very hard. Not just the timing (which i found can be a problem with cassettes) loudness/frequency distribution must also align perfectly.Found Smartsubtract https://oxfordwaveresearch.com/products/smartsubtract/ which seems to do exactly the same but it's not available for download.Is there any (AI even?) tool that might do that? I tried an online AI tool which claimed it can extract voices but it returned back silence. I want to try OpenVino but not sure it will be useful with faint spoken words in a noisy environment with a song.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43047255</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My teenage niece is getting solid at chess, but I can still beat her handily. So we came up with a fun handicap the last few times we’ve played:Every third turn, my four year old daughter gets to move for me. She doesn’t know the rules so she chooses a piece and we give her the full rundown of options where that piece can legally move. Neither of us can influence her choice, but there’s some degree of psychological play allowed for everyone’s entertainmentIt’s been unexpectedly rich and fun for everyone involved:- My daughter is slowly learning the game and likes hamming up the choice- I exercise a different part of my brain around guarding eventualities and conservative movements- Pure cackles of joy and glee from my niece whenever my daughter reaches for the queen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has anyone worked out good strategy for this variant?  At first think, I'd think Player 2 has an advantage because they are the first player who is able to make a move for their opponent and then _immediately_ play a move for themselves that exploits it.And, I suppose there might be some strategy where it's important not to expose yourself to potential shenanigans of this kind.So I'm wondering how this game looks for skilled players of both sides -- is it balanced, are the strategies interesting, etc.   Or are we trying to work that out right now?Were these rulesets chosen carefully among many options because they result in the most interesting games?  Or is this just a YOLO?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once had the idea to take this to the extreme and make a version where you only control your opponent's pieces, so in terms of this game: blunder after blunder. Hardly having any chess experience, I'm not sure how interesting it would be. There's a good chance it essentially turns the one to start into the winner. Every few moves like here might work a lot better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43063970</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As with GIMP 2.10, GIMP 3.0 ships with a Python interpreter embedded and will not use the system Python.This is great and I wish this was the same with other tools, like Kicad, Freecad and Inkscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm patiently waiting for resynthesizer to be ported. Then I will make the move to 3.0. I've used GIMP exclusively as my image editor for the past two decades and it has fulfilled my needs for web development. I really don't get all the gripe around it. It's one of the most valuable free programs on my PC. Sure, it does take time and possibly customization to get yourself a comfortable workflow. But once you get it down, you can do basically everything you need with keyboard shortcuts and blaze thru editing really quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious question: Has anyone proficient in Photoshop given GIMP a proper go and come out the other side wanting to use it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43025176</guid></item><item><title>12.

Simple and appealing to a general user but apparently worth $1k/m for business users who want access to consolidated data via API.I'm sure there's a host of businesses like this, but I don't know who the customer base is. $1k/m seems to be a lot, but I don't have a need!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the US do this? In Canada, everything is so splintered. Open Data is available at various levels (municipal, provincial), but it's in different formats, many government bodies don't expose anything, and it's all very .. uncooridnated.But this is not the first time I've seen data from the US which feels so well organized. Is the secret sauce the data/providers, or is the creator of this site just very good at organizing a big mess?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopefully they get power back soon.

Kicking the TV out of your bedroom is a neat trick that works for many.I still get distracted and doomscroll sometimes, but usually those are planned sessions. Not reading the news or caring about strangers’ opinions has done wonders for my psyche.After a few years, all of this comes naturally to me, but when I talk to people, the first thing they’re amazed by is how I manage to live like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a side note, I find that this flow state has it's addiction of it's own. I find myself doing whatever I can to find time for it. I feel like the reason mathematicians, physicists and artists of the past produced such great results is, they found the flow state so addictive, more addictive than balancing your health or family life, and thus dedicated almost entirety of their lives on it. Just have to be careful on that one. After all, our purpose is  (I think) is not just working.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why don’t posts like this ever explain what the end goal is? The biggest problem in my life is that all this work and productivity feels meaningless. Everyone is always writing as if these goals are common knowledge but I don’t even know why I work anymore other than I can’t retire yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43067303</guid></item><item><title>14.

It's more of a capacity reduction than a grid failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title sounds whimsical, but animals cause a significant amount of outages. Around 5-10% are caused by animals.

I don’t think I can ever go back to scrum.It allows devs to be creative, do what needs to be done, and ship a real feature. All without any product managers, and zero meetings.Corporate companies could never imagine not counting all their beans, but man it is so freeing if you have the option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case you are interested in Shape Up and want read more about it, Ryan Singer - the inventor of the methodology - has written a really great book about how they have been, and currently are, building and shipping products and features at 37signals.The book is called "Shape Up" (doh) and the electronic version is totally free:https://basecamp.com/shapeupI would also really recommend the rest of the books, lots of great thoughts on development and management from actual experience. Also free:https://37signals.com/books&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symantec, which once sold programming tools, tried a unique approach - scheduled maintenance. The product team worked on one product at a time. When they finished an update, they'd go on to the next product. Products were not updated out of cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43038794</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Caddy is a powerful, open-source web server designed for simplicity and easy configuration. It features automatic HTTPS by default, which enhances security and usability for developers and website owners. Caddy offers a fast and efficient performance with a focus on modern web standards, making it user-friendly for both beginners and experienced users. The server supports various plugins and modules for added functionality, such as reverse proxying, load balancing, and more, catering to a wide range of web applications and development needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43070025"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One area we have found Caddy invaluable is for local testing of APIs with HTTP2 during development. Most dev servers are HTTP1 only, and so you are limited to max of 6 concurrent connections to localhost. HTTP2 requires SSL, which would normally make it a PITA to test/setup locally for development.Throw a Caddy reverse proxy in front of your normal dev server and you immediately get HTTP2 via the root certificate it installs in your OS trust store. (https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https)We (ElectricSQL) recommend it for our users as our APIs do long polling, which with HTTP2 doesn't lock up those 6 concurrent connections.I've also found that placing it in front of Vite for normal development makes reloads much faster. Vite uses the JS module system for loading individual files in the browser with support for HMR (hot module replacement), this can result in a lot of concurrent requests for larger apps, creating a queue for those files on the six connections. Other bundlers/build tools bundle the code during development, reducing the number of files loaded into the browser, this created a bit of a debate last year on which is the better approach. With HTTP2 via Caddy in front of Vite you solve all those problems!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After switching from nginx to caddy-docker-proxy a year ago I just recently made the move to Pangolin[0] and am really enjoying the experience. It's a frontend to traefik with built-in auth and ability to tunnel traffic through Wireguard. I needed the TCP forwarding for my Minecraft server and this made it very simple.Would recommend it for anyone wanting a better version of Nginx Proxy Manager. The documentation is a little lacking so far but the maintainers are very helpful in their Discord.[0] github.com/fosrl/pangolin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I absolutely love Caddy. Used it for years. Very reliable and so easy to setup once you learn the basics. The documentation is a bit hard to get, but it saved me so much time and energy compared to trying to get letsencrypt working reliable ontop of NGINX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43070025</guid></item><item><title>17.

Did your try analysing the palette in https://huetone.ardov.me/ ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused by the usage of the word color scheme.To me a color scheme is something like monokai. A small number of colors that go well together. The application (eg syntax highlighting in a code editor) is obvious and easy. This is just...lots of monochrome colors? How would I use this? Not trying to be dismissive, I'm just confused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL about oklch()https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43072338</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing development and maintenance of Vim, a popular text editor, following the contributions of its original creator, Bram Moolenaar. It features insights from a core maintainer about the community's efforts to keep Vim relevant and up-to-date, including the integration of new features and improvements while preserving the editor's core philosophy. The maintainer emphasizes collaboration and the importance of community involvement in ensuring Vim's longevity and adaptability in the evolving landscape of software development tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using vim for 20+ years and it's been fantastically stable software for me. I have never cared about what version I am using because I've never needed to. An exception to this is that I'm now accustomed to using `:term` which came with vim 8.0 (2016?).I think it's silly when colleagues point out that VS Code has vim bindings. The bindings are what I know and enjoy, but they're only half the point. I like to work with the machine, in the terminal. I don't like my text editor being a browser that pings M$, and will end up doing so again, eventually, even after I have to search up(!) how to disable it.There's a lot of value in moving slow and not breaking things. I'm glad there are maintainers willing to carry that spirit forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to say as someone in tech, one of my "personal embarrassments" is that I still only know how to use vim on a basic level. I often see my coworkers flying through our codebases in their custom vim/nvim setups and I gotta say I get a bit jealous.But every time I think about learning vim I always go back to the argument that it's just a tool to get a job done and right now, I'm very good with one particular tool (vscode) and between my dayjob and other responsibilities I just can't justify the time sink to learn vim to a level where I can be "professionally productive". For now I mainly use it for git and the occasional markdown document I need to create on the flyBut beyond that I really admire vim and nvmim. The fact that my coworkers can use a 30 year old text editor and extend it to support the latest and greatest LLM's and language servers is just mental to me.I hope Bram is up in heaven right now, teaching god how to quit vim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is often an implied criticism of "if its not under active development for features, its not good" - which I don't agree with (and obviously neither do the VIM maintainers I think)Maintenance mode is a good place to be IMO. I don't think anyone looking at a codebase with this maturity should feel "why aren't there significant new feature updates".Wayland, ok I can see there are things which need 'bring into the modern era' but I don't think either Wayland, or XDG represents a massive about-face or fork moment. (I don't use graphically aided editors either vi or emacs, I live in terminal emulated space)The moment of fear is when it ceases to be brought into current packaging by the distributions which re-factor it. I don't see any sign of that happening either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43068884</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities and challenges associated with transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 in network infrastructure. It highlights the issues of configuration, compatibility, and lack of understanding among IT professionals, which can hinder the adoption of IPv6. The author emphasizes the importance of educating network administrators and stakeholders about IPv6 to facilitate a smoother transition, as the depletion of IPv4 addresses necessitates a shift to the new protocol for sustainable internet growth and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43069533"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IPv6 isn't hard, and as the article alludes to, it is different, but it's not even that different.What is hard, is dual stack networking. Dual stack networking absolutely sucks, it's twice the stuff you have to deal with, and the edge cases are exponentially more complex because if your setup isn't identical in both stacks, you're going to hit weird issues (like the article suggests) with one stack behaving one way and the other behaving another way.None of this is the fault of IPv6, it's a natural consequence of the strategy of having two internets during the transition period. A transition period which has now been going on longer than the internet existed when it started.Maybe 100 years from now we'll finally be able to shut off the last IPv4 system and the "dream" of IPv6 will become a reality, but until then, life is strictly more difficult on every network administrator because of dual stack.(Note: no, we could not have done it any other way. Any upgrade strategy to IPv4 that extended the address size would have necessitated having two internets. It just sucks that it's been this long and we're still not even at 50% IPv6 usage.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "IPv6 is Hard" source seems to be sarcastic, not serious. IPv6 is ridiculously easy, in the grand scheme of things.What's hard is getting people who should know better to do what they're supposed to do, without playing games. The very fact that there are people who will argue why IPv6 is unnecessary tells us everything we need to know, because occasionally those people are in the path of deployment of something public. They don't write software which works agnostically with IPv6, they don't implement addressing that's stack agnostic, they don't bother taking the extra five minutes to test with IPv6.Then you have a corporation that requires manager types to have enough "justification" to actually fix whatever Mr.-IPv4-is-good-enough, and because they don't understand that their own phone uses IPv6 all the time, they don't see a "business case" for it.The title would be longer, but perhaps more accurate, if it were "Getting know-it-alls to stop stubbornly clinging to IPv4-is-good-enough and getting managers to realize that IPv6 is not only inevitable, but ubiquitous, are hard".This article's conclusion isn't totally off, but in this case it's something that could easily be fixed by having a junior network admin just simply set things up. It's a trivial problem that's probably there because someone thinks they know better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest piece of annoyance I have with IPv6: it's really hard to tell the OS "here's your IPv6 address, here's your gateway, here are your routes, now don't mess with any of it!".With IPv4 it's easy to set up a static configuration. With IPv6, the Linux kernel is eager to listen to all sorts of advertisements from the network, and it's hard to say "no, stop, don't ever ever listen to anything except my static configuration".I can bring up IPv4 networking in a tiny fraction of a second. IPv6 networking sometimes takes seconds to settle down and be reliable.(I'd be interested in any suggestions for how to improve this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43069533</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive tool for generating code snippets and handling various programming queries. It focuses on assisting developers by allowing them to input prompts and receive code responses across different programming languages. The tool is designed to enhance productivity, support learning, and help troubleshoot coding problems by leveraging automated responses for quick coding solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is probably the most exciting thing I've read about compilers since Alexia Massalin's dissertation. gabrielsroka found this previous thread https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35294111 with discussion with the author and a lot of related reading.The title is an amusing crash blossom; it's about a generator of fast 6502 code, rather than a fast generator of 6502 code or one of the other four possibilities.He says it generates better code than anything he's seen, and on reading the writeup, it's easy to see why:&gt; The ordered basic blocks are then processed from beginning to end, generating multiple assembly code combinations per operation. The list of combinations will grow at an exponential rate, but most can be pruned using ideas from dynamic programming and branch-and-bound. (...) simulated annealing (...) solving a partitioned boolean quadratic problem (PBQP).It's tempting to assume that all this would have been infeasible for financial reasons when the 6502 was in common use, and maybe it is a little memory-hungry, but I think the bigger issue is that this is the kind of work you'd normally expect to see in a doctoral dissertation in operations research, applied mathematics, or GOFAI; there just weren't that many people out there who such an approach would occur to.Now that it's out there, though, it seems like you could apply the same techniques to code generation for more mainstream hardware. (Some of the techniques like the tree-search register allocation would probably require adjustment.) Maybe it wouldn't provide the same benefits because generating optimal code is so easy now, I don't know.  Has anyone tried?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this is very impressive there is an important qualifier missing from the article.They are NOT comparing the output from the same programming languages and so probably not the same source code either.- Their compiler uses a custom language (NesFAB) and does NOT support C- The reference compilers are all using C"NESFab is a new programming language for creating NES games. Designed with 8-bit limitations in mind, the language is more ergonomic to use than C, while also producing faster assembly code."And http://pubby.games/nesfab/doc.html#_what_is_nesfabPresumably they made a best effort to implement their algorithm as closely as possible in the two languages, but that's a lot different than comparing the output of compilers using identical input source code.So instead of saying- "In a bizarre twist, my compiler generates faster code than GCC, LLVM, and every other compiler I compared it to."It would be more accurate to say- " In a bizarre twist, my compiler [and language] generate faster code than GCC, LLVM, and every other compiler I compared it to [using C].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who makes games for two different 6502 systems, this is a really cool read. I'm curious if I could use this in any of the toolchains I use for those platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43036903</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There have been several threads about this on HN over the past few days and months. Just to avoid the confusion that seems to follow these, a few notes:(1) This is the "Download and Transfer" option where Amazon allowed users to select books they had purchased a license to and download them from the Amazon website.(2) The ability to transfer books from your computer to your Kindle using a USB cable is not affected.(3) The ability to send non-Amazon-licensed ePubs using the Send to Kindle email feature is not affected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure why anyone buys Kindles when there are so many better options available.I bought a Kobo Clara years ago, and it supports regular MOBI and ePub files.My book purchases are no longer liked with the reader and I’ve never had a problem in all these years. And this wasn’t even the best or best value for money device I could have bought.Today there are so many other better alternatives in all price points and form factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hear the complaints about Kindle but...How are we supposed to do?In three "taps" I buy a book and 10s later I start reading it.
Legally.
The device just works.The alternatives?
Libraries here (France) have a very limited offer of ebooks. 
Even for ebooks in English.
I owned a Kobo circa 2013 and it was awful.
I tried friend's devices more recently, and it's not the UX I expect from a "book".A simple comparison; "Parable of the Sower", bought it for 3.49€ on amazon.fr, it's at 5.26€ on ebooks.com and it still got DRMs.Even pirating is less convenient: some files are buggy, some files are weird OCR of physical books, you have to deal with the download and transfer...And I just can't read physical books. I hate that.So usually, if I really enjoy an ebook, I buy a physical copy in a local bookstore and give it to a friend/whoever I think is going to like it.I would love an open ecosystem where I could rent ebooks from a library, and buy books that can be read wherever I want.
But that's not going to happen because the big guns of the industry think they know better.So that's where I'm at: buying &amp; reading books in Amazon's walled garden, or doing neither at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43070155</guid></item><item><title>22. 50 Years of Travel Tips</title><link>https://kk.org/thetechnium/50-years-of-travel-tips/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One travel technique that has worked very well for me takes place the day before my trip: using a pre-travel prep-and-packing checklist.  I created this checklist about 15 years ago and still refine it occasionally.  This list has three sections:A) Preparation tasks: Like printing essential travel documents, saving a backup to my mobile phone, buying foreign currency, activating data roaming, etc.B) Packing list: Mine currently has about 30 or so items, covering everything from the very basics, like toothbrush and toothpaste, to the often-overlooked, like reusable ziplock bags, microfibre cloths, etc.C) Last minute checks: These are final tasks to complete just before leaving home. This includes double-checking that passports are packed, non-essential electrical appliances and lamps are switched off, balcony doors are locked, wet waste has been properly disposed of, etc.By the time I step into a taxi or train to the airport, I can fully focus on the journey ahead rather than worrying about forgotten items. After all, this checklist has served me well for the past 15 years. Every item is checked off before I leave home, so as soon as I get into a taxi or train, I can relax, knowing that nothing has been forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Crash a wedding. You are not a nuisance; you are the celebrity guest!  ... They will usually feel honored. You can offer the newlyweds a small token gift of cash if you want. You will be obliged to dance. Take photos of them; they will take photos of you. It will make your day and theirs. (I’ve crashed a wedding in most of the countries I have visited.)That will only work if a white tourist wedding crashes in a poor country. That will not work if I (as a brown-colored southeast asian) do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of great advice here. But..&gt;In many parts of the world today motorcycles play the role of cars. That means you can hire a moto-taxi to take you on the back seat, or to summon a moto-taxi with an uber-like app, or to take a motorcycle tour with a guide doing the driving. In areas where motorcycles dominate they will be ten times more efficient than slowly going by car.I would be extremely wary about this. You are so much more vulnerable on a bike. And you won't even be wearing proper protective equipment. Even if they lend you a helmet, it is unlikely to fit properly and don't know how many times it has been dropped or involved in a crash. Also the most common injuries to motorcyclists are to the legs, and I doubt they will be lending you boots or biking trousers.No thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43066720</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the contributions of physicist Hans Bethe to quantum theory, particularly his unexpected discovery of effective theories that simplify complex problems in quantum physics. It highlights how Bethe’s work, initially focused on nuclear reactions and later expanding into various areas of theoretical physics, revolutionized understanding in fields such as condensed matter and quantum mechanics. The piece emphasizes Bethe's ability to derive results that were not only mathematically robust but also practical for experimental verification, showcasing his profound impact on the development of modern physics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did this very recently for a 19th century book in German with occasionally some Greek. The method that produces the highest level of accuracy I've found is to use ImageMagick to extract each page as a image, then send each image file to Claude Sonnet (encoded as base64) with a simple user prompt like "Transcribe the complete text from this image verbatim with no additional commentary or explanations". The whole thing is completed in under an hour &amp; the result is near perfect and certainly much better than from standard OCR softwares.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven’t seen anyone else mention this tool yet, but I’ve found great accuracy and flexibility with [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF). It (usually) detects and fixes page rotation, and works quite well on slanted text or A | B pages in regards to copying and formatting. I believe it uses tesseract in the background, but using it is very simple and it has the just works factor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a high-quality scan of PAIP (Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming), and worked on OCR'ing and incorporating that into an admittedly imperfect git repo of Markdown files. I used Scantailor to deskew and do other adjustments before applying Tesseract, via OCRmyPDF. I wrote notes for some of my process over at https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/releases/tag/v1.2 .I'd also tried ocrit, which uses Apple's Vision framework for OCR, with some success - https://github.com/insidegui/ocritIt's an ongoing, iterative process. I'll watch this thread with interest.Some recent threads that might be helpful:* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443022 - Show HN: Adventures in OCR* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045801 - Benchmarking vision-language models on OCR in dynamic video environments - driscoll42 posted some stats from research* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43043671 - OCR4all(Meaning, I have these browser tabs open, I haven't fully digested them yet)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43048698</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the author's experience dining at a North Korean restaurant in Shanghai, highlighting the unique atmosphere, the décor reflecting North Korean culture, and the unusual yet intriguing menu options. The author describes the performances by North Korean waitstaff, who entertain guests with singing and dancing, contributing to an immersive experience. The food is noted for its distinct flavors, although the overall dining experience raises questions about the implications of supporting such establishments. The piece provides insights into the cultural fusion and complexities of dining in a North Korean-themed venue outside of North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

However, one has to be aware of the fact that these restaurants are reportedly linked to the secretive North Korean party organization, Room 39 [1], which means that all revenue flows directly into the hands of the Kim dynasty, so in the best case you'll help financing their next BMW or much worse, the nuclear arms program—neither of these I'm very comfortable with…[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_39&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43065586</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Surrey have discovered evidence supporting the existence of two distinct arrows of time in the quantum realm, which challenge traditional understandings of time's linear flow. This study, published in the journal "Nature Communications," reveals that one arrow correlates to the increase of entropy, aligned with thermodynamic principles, while the other relates to the emergence of quantum states. The findings could have significant implications for the fields of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, suggesting that time may not be perceived as a singular dimension but rather as having multiple aspects depending on the quantum interactions involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43072483"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Minkowski metric is    Δs = sqrt(-Δt^2 + Δx^2 + Δy^2 + Δz^2)

One aspect of this is that, if you sub `t -&gt; -t'`, that's just as good a solution too. Which would suggest any solution with a positive time direction can have a negative time direction, just as easily. Is this widely assumed to be true, or at least physically meaningful?There's also Wick rotations, where you can sub `t -&gt; it'`, and then Minkowskian spacetime becomes Euclidean but time becomes complex-valued. Groovy stuff.I'm not much of a physics buff but I loved reading Julian Barbour's The Janus Point for a great treatment of the possibility of negative time.The craziest thing I've seen though is the suggestion that an accelerating charge, emitting radiation that interacts with the charge itself and imparts a backreacting force on the charge, supposedly has solutions whose interpretation would suggest that it would be sending signals back in time. [0][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham–Lorentz_force&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have never understood why physicists get so hung up on the arrow of time and entropy.If you have a casual system, then statistically, things will tend to become more disordered over time, because there are just more ways to be disordered than ordered.Lots of clever people seem to agonise about this, but I don't see any problem.  What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the paper’s conclusion:“Our findings are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics and emphasise the distinction between the concepts of irreversibility and time-reversal symmetry. Once the arrow of time and a particular low entropy initial condition at have been chosen, then the von Neumann entropy will increase forward in time from the temporal origin. However, a different choice of the arrow of time would have implied the same dynamics. The Markov approximation applied to the time-reversed evolution leads likewise to the same dissipation and entropy increase. Consequently any thermal equilibrium state for a forward-running trajectory is also an equilibrium thermal state for any time-reversed trajectory, and entropy increases in both directions: the system thermalises into both time directions. […]“Furthermore, we speculate that these results may reflect on the cosmological arrow of time. In fact, the natural assumption that the universe was dissipative from time zero onwards would suggest that a model of it would rely on the Markov approximation performed at the moment of the Big Bang. If so, this would imply that two opposing arrows of time would have emerged from the Big Bang, which would account in turn for the maintenance of time-reversal symmetry despite the ensuing dissipative nature of the universe. We would happen to live in one of them, where dissipation and entropy increase are common experience, but unaware of the existence of the other alternative possibility.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43072483</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried looking for how they're attacking ELRS (control link),  and I'm seeing nothing.There's Joachim's LoRa library. However ELRS uses the 2.4GHz and its a blend of LoRa and FHSS. Basically you need a BladeRF or better to attack the control link properly.And given the RPi platform, they're likely using RPITX as the SDR transmitter. Lucky to get 1MHz bandwidth...  And you need 80MHz minimum.And the RPi doesn't have the horsepower to properly do 20 or more LoRa channels, with 112MHz mode on Blade.Until I see a BoM, code, or demonstration, I'm going to consider this to be hogwash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately the probable countermeasure to things like this pushing more autonomy to the drone so expect a lot less human in the loop control where jamming is a problem i.e active conflict zones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wouldn’t intentional interference be very illegal to do at random? Sure, hard to get caught but isn’t it illegal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43071110</guid></item><item><title>34.

However, I must have skipped some education about shell history and/or its default settings, because half the time I need it, the command I want isn't there to be found. I also observed the following kinds of behaviors:- Sometimes, shell history seems to be scoped (or reacting to) current working directory;- Sometimes, commands executed on remote machines end up being saved in local history;- When the shell gets killed (e.g. when Emacs crashes and takes down the shells open inside with it), or the system crashes, sometimes the history gets saved, and sometimes nothing remains from a session that spanned multiple days;- When I have multiple terminals open, it's a coin toss whether only one will have history saved or all of them, and then another toss as to whether histories will be CWD-sensitive or not.Is there a good primer/community consensus on how to configure shell so all history gets saved in sensible manner (including continuously, so it survives a crash)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/cantino/mcflyhttps://github.com/atuinsh/atuinYou're welcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43071085</guid></item><item><title>35.

Like a lot of companies that have been successful for a long time, that will take time. But in the 15 years of watching them lose more and more 'margin' on the search ads business and the commensurate changes they have made to their core product, it doesn't seem like they are going to re-invent themselves.[1] Yes I know, people tell me all the time, Google's not going out of business!

At Google, we have already been using these signals responsibly to fight against spam and fraud for years. Now, with new innovations like PETs to mitigate risks, we see an opportunity to set a high privacy bar on the use of data like IP. We can do this by applying privacy-preserving protections that help businesses reach their customers across these new platforms without the need to re-identify them. And because we’re looking to encourage responsible data use as the new standard across the web, we’ll also partner with the broader ads industry and help make PETs more accessible"I consider myself fairly smart and used to read between the lines of the usual corporate bullcrap but here it's so convulated.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of funding cuts proposed by the Trump administration for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their potential impact on medical research and public health. It outlines how these cuts could affect various ongoing research projects, limit advances in medical science, and hinder the development of new treatments and cures.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a PhD student in Computer Science, I wanted to fund my research without depending on other people.  So I wrote, and won, a grant for $650,000.The University of Washington took 55% off the top in "indirect costs."  Then of the direct costs, a bunch more taxes went to the department, the lab, etc.  I ended up getting about $40,000 total from that grant to fund my actual research.I was told that this is just how the game works.The Lesson: There is a huge amount of waste in academic grants.The university does not need 55% indirect costs to fund my research.  They gave me a laptop and an office to work in.  But the laptop actually came out of direct costs.  And as for the office... well, I tended not to use it.  Coffeeshops were nicer places to work.So that 55% — $357,500 — was not necessary for research.   It disappeared in an administrative hierarchy that kept growing.  I talked to professors from 20 years before, and they said that the administration had grown 3x in their time being there.  They built their reputation as scientists when everything was smaller and cheaper.  Now all that reputation is generating more money, which is getting gobbled up by an administration that wasn't needed when they produced their original successes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some believe this cut will be covered by the research universities and their associated medical centers. That may be true for a limited time, in a few institutes, for a small set of cases. However, it’s just a cut to medical research, and a deep one at that.Indirect costs support researchers’ needs that the institution provides. For example, who ensures the researcher’s laptop is secure? For basic research, how is lab equipment obtained? Who provides infrastructure to access observational data from an electronic health record system? Categorize these services as you wish, but these services are needed, they have costs, and the expense will need to be covered for medical research to happen. If they can no longer be considered indirect, then they will become itemized and the researcher’s direct budget will have to cover them. For example, laptops permitted to access the institutional network may have a monthly fee that covers system admin time.In the short run, it’ll mean some research simply won’t happen as the researcher doesn’t have budget for new fees the institution charges for equipment/services that were previously “free”. For new grants, it means a greater part of the research budget will have to be itemized with these costs, eg less funding for researcher or graduate assistant effort. Either the overall grant direct costs will have to go up, or less research happens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sean Carroll (the physicist) just did a solo podcast about federal funding for universities and what these cuts would mean,https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/02/12/bonu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43064637</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses ten different Terraform configuration root setups, aiming to guide users in organizing their Terraform projects more effectively. It highlights various approaches, including single-root module setups, multi-root module arrangements, as well as strategies for managing state files and workspace configurations. The piece emphasizes best practices for maintaining clarity and scalability in infrastructure as code processes, catering to both beginner and experienced users looking to optimize their Terraform implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use a single codebase to deploy to multiple environments. The setup looks like this:  - root
  -- /envs
  --- / dev.tfvars
  --- / prod.tfvars
  - main.tf

When it gets deployed by the CICD, the right tfvars file is passed in via the -var-file parameter. A standard `env` var is also passed in, and used as a basis for a naming convention.  Backend is also set by the pipeline.The rationale here is that our environments should be almost the same between them, and any variations should be accomplished by parameterization.Modules are kept either in separate repos, if they need to be shared between many workspaces, or under the `modules` subfolder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is terrible. All options seem to assume state is stored locally (not, say, in S3). Many options are just the same as others but only one environment, or with some project-specific difference like 'there is a backend and a frontend' or 'a few services' which has nothing to do with how you structure the terraform side of it.All of them either don't address or use multiple directories to handle multiple environments (and assume a static list). What?! No, use terraform workspaces, or a single module that you instantiate for each environment. Or terragrunt if you really want. TFA is just a blogspam mess from either AI or someone that's spent about 20 minutes with a Youtube video to learn terraform &amp; push out their latest deep dive content guys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is ever evolving but we currently do;Composable modules such as `terraform-aws-lambda/modules/standard-function`, `terraform-aws-iam/moduls/role-for-aws-lambda`, etc, which get composed for a specific usecase in a root module (which we call stacks). The stack has directories under it such as `dev/main/primary/` `dev/sandbox-a/primary/` `dev/sandbox-a/test-a/`, etc, where `dev` is environment, `main/sandbox-a` is tenant and the `primary/test-a` is the namespace. The namespaces contain a `tfvars` file and potentially some namespace specific assets, readme's, documentation, etc. The CD system then deploys the root module for each namespace present.Stacks are then optionally (sometimes deeply) nested under parent directories, which are used for change control purposes, variable inference and consistency testing.OpenTofu &gt;1.8.0 is required for all of this to keep it nice and tidy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43026882</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Calling Out Room Dynamics" explores the concept of leadership in group settings and emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the subtle dynamics that occur during discussions and interactions. It highlights strategies for leaders to facilitate more inclusive and productive conversations by being aware of power imbalances, communication styles, and emotional undercurrents within the group. The piece encourages leaders to foster an environment where all voices are heard and valued, ultimately leading to more effective collaboration and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meetings are just a cult gathering. Generally, only the cult leaders are naturals in group settings. Everyone else just copies and tries to fit in (lurkers and contributors). The cult leaders will always be the same people, it's an archetype. The meeting goes as comfortably as the cult leaders allow (not necessarily through allowance, but through tone and expectations).The more you examine what a cult your company and industry is, the more you realize you have to be vigilant about human nature (in yourself and others)."leadership.garden"They give themselves away."Picture this: You’re in a high-stakes product roadmap meeting. The room is a pressure cooker of competing priorities and barely concealed tension."These people are in fantasy world. NONE OF YOU have worked on anything high stakes, tech has always been non critical (mostly). But this how they think, and the take away they provide is how to be manipulative (like I said, they are naturals). That's the problem with the cult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This piece reminded me of a few things I think about a bit too much:- I imagine there would be almost zero storytelling (as we know it) if people where better at communicating like this (as most plots would just seem weird).- something about this made me think about bullying and how we haven't managed to "solve" that problem (for kids or adults)- there are a few corporate-speak words in the text that makes me question myself if I've failed to realise that this is a sarcastic piece, but I'm 95% sure it's an honest text with clear intentions.- I'm probably misremembering a lot, but I quite like how this expands a tiny bit on Non-Violent Communication to include the "we" that is so important in groups.[Edit] added the word "much" in the first paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much of this is a symptom of Corpo Talk. Corpo Talk avoids offending anyone, but may lead to the elephant in the room only getting discussed over beers later (WFH equivalent: 1:1 Zoom calls).Corpo Talk colors people after a while. Even some of this author's suggestions are beating around the bush. They advocate "naming what's happening"  and then just as quickly walk that back to "Ask, Don’t Tell" and the perennially Corpo "we."Alternate title: "Folks, I've noticed we are calling out room dynamics? Do we think that's an art?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43025857</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "New Time," which proposes a shift in how we perceive and manage our daily schedules and productivity. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on meaningful activities and personal well-being rather than adhering strictly to conventional time structures. The author highlights the benefits of flexible time management, advocating for a balanced approach that prioritizes both work and personal life, ultimately leading to improved mental health and fulfillment. The piece encourages readers to reconsider traditional time constraints and adopt a more holistic perspective on time.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fail to see TFA's concerns or take them very seriously.&gt; time() unnecessarily takes a pointer argument to write toMinor cosmetic issue.&gt; strftime() has to write to a string of a fixed length it can not dynamically allocate (This is less legacy than it is bad design)This is often a good way to structure string functions in C. The fact that TFA repeated the constant 40 instead of using sizeof() immediately signals that they are unfamiliar with the idioms. A "you problem".Doing heap allocation where it is not required could be a problem for some use cases.&gt; localtime() needs the pointer to a time_t value even though it does not change it because of register size concerns on PDP-11’sAlso minor and cosmetic.&gt; sleep() cannot sleep for sub-second amounts of time, usleep() is deprecated and it’s alternative nanosleep() requires you to define variablessleep(3) is not really a "time function" in the sense of the others mentioned, it is a thread scheduler function. As such it kind of exists in a different universe. This is also shown by the fact that it's part of POSIX and not the C standard, like time(2) is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;95% of the supposed issues with C could be solved by a new standard library,  integrating the debugger into the compiler as the default build/run environment (with auto address sanitisation, frame protection, etc. etc.), and a default strict mode error checking.It would then be actually really hard to successfully run a C program (in the debugger) with any problems. Under these conditions it'd be easy to imagine most C programs running with fewer bugs (, leaks, etc.) than Rust programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wasn’t aware that on non-x86 platforms long double is often implemented with quadruple precision. I had assumed it was an x87-specific hack. On ARM64 windows/macos long double is apparently 64-bits which could be a problem.Personally something about that solution is unsatisfying. Feels like it’d be slow, even though that wouldn’t matter 95% of the time. I’d rather have 128-bit integer of nanoseconds.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_double&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43068283</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to leave the Elm programming language community, citing various challenges and frustrations encountered during their experience. Key points include the perceived limitations of the Elm ecosystem, the difficulties with library support, and the growing disconnect between the language’s philosophy and the author's programming needs. The author reflects on the initial excitement about Elm but ultimately feels it no longer aligns with their development style and goals, leading to a search for alternatives that better suit their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I asked "Ask HN: Is Elm dead" in 2022 with mixed results.
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31485011IMO it's safe to say that Elm is dead and won't come back with this attitude of the core team (which is not the only problem of the language). We never switched to Elm 0.19 from 0.18 but moved on to rewrite in Svelte 5 with TypeScript and never looked back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading this article when it was published, it seems like everything said continues to be true about Elm, so much that I don't hear about anyone using Elm these days, as even those who have used it as legacy code have now largely had enough time to migrate away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is critical primarily of Elm's governance and processes, and claims that these are what killed the project.  I don't think that's entirely true.  There was a recent interview with the creator of Elm here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SUM4869ODcI'd encourage everyone to watch that as a grain of salt to TFA.  It seems like the project leader felt he was being taken advantage of, and was just not getting out as much as he was putting in.  That's his decision to make and he doesn't owe anyone anything.  If you want continued support, pay up.Elm's governance and process are what made it such a delight to use.  Instead of allowing the full spectrum of bad ideas in frontend development to slowly make their way into the language, the authors carefully curated a coherent set of good ideas.  They said no to a lot of things, and cut out as often as put in.  This is going to piss off a lot of people because it means saying no to a lot of people.  Saying yes to those people would make the language worse; you can't have it both ways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43069475</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For all the younger people I think it's important to know, that before Windows 95 the concept of "shutting down" a computer was mostly unknown.DOS never had an option to shut down, you just saved your work and turned off the computer. Also with Windows 3.x it was normal to just switch the PC off, without any prior shut down process.Back in the days most software was synchronous, there were no background processes, no write cache (and read cache was optional). Once the "saving document" message was gone, it was written to disk. With floppys and early hard drives it was easy to hear anyway, when the noise stopped it was written to disk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issue I have is the wording.The problem really comes down to the fact that windows couldn't actually power off the computer like it can today.I think the message should have said: "Windows shutdown complete. Please power off the computer."This more clearly implies that not only is it safe to turn off your computer, it's recommended you do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These shutdown splashes are one reason why I enjoy working with AT motherboards, those with the old P8 + P9 power connector ("red to red and it's dead").There's some charm and nostalgia in the computer only having two states - on and off. No standby power, no S1-S4 states, no wake-on-LAN, no management engine, etc. Press the power button - hopefully a chunky rocker switch - and the system is off (minus the RTC battery).I have an XP machine running on such a motherboard and it too supports the "safe to shutdown" splash. Hibernate also works, so if I really want to, I can put it to "sleep" with no power at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43071193</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article features a collection of striking photographs showcasing notable examples of Brutalist architecture in Japan. It highlights the distinctive design elements and historical significance of these buildings, emphasizing their impact on the urban landscape and architectural heritage. The images capture the raw concrete structures and unique aesthetic that characterize the Brutalist style, celebrating their artful yet functional designs. The piece offers insight into Japan's architectural evolution and the cultural context surrounding these often-overlooked structures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These are beautiful buildings and the article is worth t for the pictures alone.Now modern architecture is generally appreciated in Japan. For instance the first one, the Okinawa art museum is rated 4.2/5 as a destination on domestic siteshttps://www.jalan.net/kankou/spt_47201ae3302051347/kuchikomi...Is the "divisive" bit in the title just clickbait ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It never rains in an architect's world.The elegant lines, the broad sweeps, the little-people models and their renderings, all exist on a sunny spring day in April.People live in a world where it rains and snows and sun-bakes. And, channeling my inner Jeff Goldblum, life finds a way.Net result is that buildings that look beautiful on paper end up gray and splodged with rust marks, mold, moss, water damage and all the impacts of living on a wet planet.Why anyone thought Brutalism would work in a country like the UK for example is beyond me. Perhaps it works in Japan (to some extent) because they have an intense pride in things being clean and comme il faut. I speculate that they also appreciate honesty-in-materials which is one of the tenets of Brutalism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get that the “rawness” of the concrete is what literally makes these “brutalist”, but to my layman’s eye, dying the concrete almost always makes the building appear more attractive and less like a post-Soviet ruin.https://www.dezeen.com/tag/coloured-concrete/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43067378</guid></item><item><title>46.

He plays ice hockey and has a pouch in his hockey pants for his phone. It’s never had an issue through all the bumps that ice hockey brings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does it need to be a smartphone and why isn’t there a dedicated device for this?Given the obvious costs and issues associated with a full-featured phone, it seems like this could be something like an old school pager (which could be smaller and much more durable).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some insulin pumps now connect to continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to create a full-loop system.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the various hidden costs and challenges associated with being a content creator on YouTube. It highlights financial burdens such as production expenses, equipment, and potential income loss from a primary job. Additionally, the piece addresses the mental toll of the platform's demands, including the pressure to constantly produce content, maintain audience engagement, and navigate algorithm changes. Ultimately, it emphasizes the need for creators to weigh these costs against the benefits of visibility and revenue on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mistake was for the expenses to be so high. It's because she previously worked at corporate channels that had those positions so she hired for those roles without understanding that a new channel in a crowded segment (cooking) will take many years to build an audience.If she had done more of the work herself, it may have meant longer time between each video but more potential for the channel to be profitable.Profitable channels, and there's not that many of them, usually take many years to get to profitability- or some semblance of being able to live off YT. Without that patience and keeping costs down while income is low, is a recipe for an unprofitable channel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The creators I see on YouTube are EXTREMELY lean. Typically it's them and an editor. Some video game creators stream on twitch and record the YouTube videos live on stream. Pass the content to your editor and do light editing work and you have a video. You also collected ad revenue from the stream. Also shorts are pretty important promotional tools and if you're making the videos anyway cutting out a good 15 second chunk for a short is pretty doable.I get that the author wants to be a chef and that's fine but I don't think YouTube really rewards high production costs as much as pushing out frequent content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To advertise on my channel, that number [CPM] is about $29 per thousand views.&gt; My RPM is around $10&gt; Again: It costs $29 per thousand to run an ad in my videos, and I get $10 per thousand. Where does the other $19 go?You can't combine those two stats like this. CPM is the cost to the advertiser per ad view. RPM is the payout to the creator per video view. But it's not the case that every video will result in exactly one ad view. Sometimes the viewer is blocking ads. Sometimes there's no ad in the inventory for that specific view event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43062436</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless there's a different kind of rotation in later levels, what happens after forming a line is equivalent to having the existing structure "collapse" under gravity (any suspended blocks fall straight down). This is purely beneficial to the player, and means there's a bit less strategy involved than I would first have thought: you can just play normally and any errors will get fixed every time you complete a line!Edit: I'm kind of wrong about that because there's a different kind of rotation that happens if you form a complete vertical line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it even possible to "complete a vertical line"? In normal Tetris, completing a vertical line means you've lost, because the screen has filled up.Various suggestions: Make completing a line rotate the board instead of flipping it. Make completing a 4x4 quadrant rotate the board in the appropriate direction. Make rotating the board not re-fall the blocks (since as others have said, this makes the game trivial): this would make it almost instant death to rotate the board twice in the same direction in a row, which might not be a bad idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty cool, but the sudden ramp up in speed makes it impossible around 7000 points - speed should probably increase more linearly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43048190</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you manage to curate a large enough collection of AI-generated playlists, would you consider putting it on Kaggle? This way, others could use it to train AI models to automatically detect AI-generated music.We did something similar by sharing a dataset of around 7,000 AI-generated fake podcasts on Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/listennotes/ai-generated-fak...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Along similar lines, a blocklist for filtering AI crap out of image searches:https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; since then, i really started to notice that my youtube recommendations have been colonized to a very large degree by mixes made entirely out of AI generated musicTurn off your YT watch history and search history. I've advocated for this on HN for years. Watching one or two AI slop videos won't ruin your recommendations, leaving the algorithm to rely on your likes to find you stuff you'd want to watch.Now if only YT could fix search and allow me to block Shorts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43067419</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fundamentals of the Rust programming language, highlighting its key features such as safety, concurrency, and performance. It provides an overview of Rust's type system, memory management, and ownership model, along with practical examples for beginners. Additionally, it emphasizes Rust’s community and ecosystem, recommending resources for learning and development, and encourages readers to explore the language for building reliable and efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharing types between React and a Typescript backend is great DX for developing both in parallel and I've not seen anything that comes close to being as enjoyable. Being able to change the signature of an API endpoint and immediately having all places in the codebase where the change will cause problems flagged as type errors is wonderful. I went back to working with duplicated types across python/typescript on a contract project recently and it took me 5x longer to fix the downstream implications of signature changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title should really be "Rust Is Eating JavaScript Tooling".Except for a nod to WASM, all the examples are about the JavaScript toolchain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm the author of one of the WASM-JS frameworks listed in the article. I now do frontends mainly in HTML + CSS + JS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43067585</guid></item></channel></rss>
